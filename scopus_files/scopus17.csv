Authors examined residents' perceptions of tourism impacts on four SES aspects: ecosystems, local knowledge, people and technology and property rights institutions. The aim is to find area that will be a ""common ground"" for community and area that can be a source of conflict and will require additional work to solve the differences. Second objective was to examine residents' perception towards future local development tourism policies (winter tourism, seasonality and environment and culture) and how those policies can affect natural, socio-economic and cultural aspects of mountain area. Residents' perceptions of sustainable tourism development potential, perceived tourism impacts, analysis of community attachment and employment sector of stakeholder were involved in this study. The authors applied the Q-methodology, as one SES-allied approach, in a small mountain community of Kopaonik, the Republic of Serbia. The results revealed that residents' agreement/disagreement is connected with two aspects: ecosystem and property rights and that ecosystem can be significantly influenced by all three development policies. Findings suggest that development of future natural conservation plans and new cultural attractions can have positive effects on all parts of social-ecological system. Some practical implications of those findings for tourism planning and development are also discussed. © 2017 by the authors.",Mountain; Residents' perception; Social-ecological system; Sustainability; Sustainable ecology; Sustainable tourism; Tourism impact; Tourism policies,anthropogenic effect; ecotourism; mountain region; perception; policy development; property rights; seasonality; stakeholder; sustainability; tourism development; tourism economics; tourist destination; traditional knowledge; Kopaonik; Serbia,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039776635

The aim of the paper is to clarify around one obviously defined objective-to point out the competitiveness of sustainable rural tourism in typical post-socialist settings. The data for this study were collected using the Integrated Model of Destination Competitiveness to observe Serbian and Slovenian competitiveness in tourism. Determinants were assessed using a survey evaluating four demanding factors and 20 supporting factors, based upon a five-point Likert Scale. The results indicated that the friendliness of residents towards visitors, easy communication between them, together with quality of infrastructure and health facilities show the highest level of statistical correlation. These are the main propositions to start an initiative for the authorities in local communities to actively participate in sustainable rural development.

Firstly, the key characteristics of the social groups in this research, 'potential middle class' and 'manual workers' are defined. This is followed by a review of two parental educational strategies: concerted cultivation and accomplishment of natural growth. Two theoretical explanations for gender imbalance in the division of unpaid family labour are offered. These are the economic/bargaining perspective and the gender perspective. Then, drawing on in-depth interviews with fathers and mothers from small Russian towns, the conclusion is reached that fathering practices in these families have situational character, defined by, in Bourdieu’s term, their 'habitus'. Many fathers still keep a 'low bar for fatherhood'. The less affluent families from Russian provinces do not rate their children’s opportunities for social mobility very highly, so they motivate them to be successful in sports, thus accomplishing a variant of the 'natural growth' educational strategy. The gender contract in these families can be characterized by distinct gender imbalance; many fathers still think that house work and childcare are a mother’s responsibility. Even the fathers who were labelled as 'involved' demonstrate rigid views on the preferred life trajectory of their daughters. It is noted that the degree of father’s involvement depends on the partners' negotiating the terms of their family gender contract. Traditional gender ideology and notions about gender inequality make parenthood the sole responsibility of mothers, and breadwinning the ultimate duty of fathers.",Educational strategies; Fatherhood; Gender contract; Parenthood,,English,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039839258

The idea of studying housing experiences, housing conditions and trends is introduced as a new research direction in this paper. These data allow us to understand: (a) what kind of dynamic processes take place within the studied groups and regions; (b) how social and physical structures have changed; (c) what new meanings are emerging from this process. Housing mobility offers an optical lens that can shed light on social problems by revealing what social groups are ‘doing well’ within the existing order, and which are stagnating or in decline. The article examines the criteria for singling out housing groups, including their multi-component structure, such as housing serving as a source of income, property relations, and the characteristics of a primary housing unit. Based on the analysis of housing groups, we raise the question of drawing the boundaries for their identification. The article also touches upon some of the constraints in studying housing mobility. Firstly, it is shown inter alia that there is some ambiguity in determining housing status, and the boundaries between housing groups, and the bearer of the housing status can be blurry (family or individual). Secondly, the problem of sampling (general population) was also revealed. Where should the priority be in achieving a representative sample? Should the focus be on the types of dwellings, who lives there (families, individuals) or the lifestyles of those living there? Thirdly, this article shows that it is methodologically challenging to survey the most ‘mobile’ and resourceful groups within housing. Not only do they live in hard-to-reach houses and buildings 'guarded' by concierges, these 'mobile' people are rarely at home. Therefore, these groups are hard to include in household surveys, and various methods of data collection and tracing techniques have to be used to reach them. Fourthly, the types of housing scales used are fragmented and empirically rootless. An adequate methodological solution may be found by working with local communities, be they small towns, districts, or villages. The article also focuses on the importance of integrating qualitative methods, which help discover the changes in the meanings, and quantitative methods, which show the scale and dynamics of housing mobility.",Housing mobility; Housing status; Social mobility; Types of housing,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039855272

The research is carried out on the sample of 7546 companies from Eastern Europe for the period 2010-2015. Eastern European countries have a unique institutional and business environment that is relevant to the purpose of this paper. We divide the sample into 2 fundamentally different economic sectors - industrial and retail - and test the significance of each factor in the main relationship. We also examine the factor of the firm's ownership form by comparing earnings quality with investment efficiency values between public and private companies. Our main results show that a higher earnings quality mitigates both overinvestment and underinvestment issues. The relationship between earnings quality and underinvestment turns out to be stronger in the industrial sector. As for the comparison of public and private firms, public companies on average demonstrate a higher earnings quality and lower overinvestment issues. © 2017 by Victoria Cherkasova.",Earnings quality; financial reporting quality; investment efficiency; overinvestment; underinvestment,,English,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045843509

We focus on language families of northern Eurasia, chiefly the three oldest families (Indo-European, Uralic, Nakh-Daghestanian), some of their daughter branches aged about 2000-3000 years, and one younger family for which we have data on enough daughters to support a family phylogeny (Tungusic). We use the 18-pair wordlist of Nichols et al. 2004, which typologizes each pair of verbs depending on which of the two is derived. We make some improvements in the coding of grammatical properties and the typologization of pairs. NeighborNet trees based on this information reveal family-wide linguistic geography and areal trends. Adding minimal information about the cognacy or non-cognacy of the roots of the wordlist items produces Neighbor- Net trees which approximate well the known phylogeny of the family. Thus very small closed data sets, collected originally for typology, yield rich information about language family history - strikingly, a mere 18 verbs (9 pairs), coded for morphological type and cognacy, yield a very good genealogical tree - while historical methods have also improved the typology. © by Riho Grünthal 2018.",causative; phylogeny; Slavic; transitive; Uralic,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042082497

The disorder in this chain is due to the random offset charges. This chain is one of the simplest physical systems to study many-body localization. We show that the system may exhibit three distinct regimes: insulating, characterized by the full localization of many-body wave functions, a fully delocalized (metallic) one characterized by the wave functions that take all the available phase volume, and the intermediate regime in which the volume taken by the wave function scales as a nontrivial power of the full Hilbert-space volume. In the intermediate nonergodic regime the Thouless conductance (generalized to the many-body problem) does not change as a function of the chain length indicating a failure of the conventional single-parameter scaling theory of localization transition. The local spectra in this regime display the fractal structure in the energy space which is related with the fractal structure of wave functions in the Hilbert space. A simple theory of fractality of local spectra is proposed, and a scaling relationship between fractal dimensions in the Hilbert and energy spaces is suggested and numerically tested. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039441558

A concept of structural similarity has a vague framework that can be slightly refined under considering a particular case of strict proportionality between row and column marginal totals for target and initial matrices. Here the question arises: can we accept the initial matrix homothety as optimal solution for proportionality case of matrix-updating problem? In most practical situations, an affirmative answer to the question is almost obvious. It is natural to call this common notion by homothetic paradigm and to refer its checking as homothetic testing. Some well-known methods for matrix updating serve as an additional instrumental confirmation to validity of homothetic paradigm. It is shown that RAS method and Kuroda’s method pass through the homothetic test successfully. Homothetic paradigm can be helpful for enhancing a collection of matrix updating methods based on constrained minimization of the distance functions.

The goal of this study is to replicate previous findings on IGT performance in patients with dorsolateral lesions compared to controls.Methods: We obtained data from patients with right frontal lobe tumors (n = 12), localized in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and healthy controls (n = 21) who undertook the IGT, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT), and D-KEFS Color-Word Interference Test.Results: The performance in the IGT, WCST, and EI tests is impaired in the clinical group. At the subgroup level, we found patients had lower EI scores regarding the ability to use ""emotions for thinking facilitation"". However, we found an interaction between the EI scores regarding the ability ""the perception and identification of emotions"" and the performance on WCST only in the patient group.Conclusion: This study raises the possibility of identifying components of EI which could be helpful in understanding the impairment of patients with right dorsolateral lesions. © The Author 2017.

Between 2003 and 2014, the length of life rose by 6.6 years among males and by 4.6 years among females. While positive trends in life expectancy are observed in all regions of Russia, these trends are unfolding differently in different regions. First, regions entered the phase of life expectancy growth at different points in time. Second, the age- and cause-specific components of the gains in life expectancy and the number of years added vary noticeably. In this paper, we apply decomposition techniques—specifically, the stepwise replacement algorithm—to examine the age- and cause-specific components of the changes in inter-regional disparities during the current period of health improvement. The absolute inter-regional disparities in length of life, measured by the population-weighted standard deviation, decreased slightly between 2003 and 2014, from 3.3 to 3.2 years for males, and from 2.0 to 1.8 years for females. The decomposition of these small changes by ages and causes of death shows that these shifts were the result of diverse effects of mortality convergence at young and middle ages, and of mortality divergence at older ages. With respect to causes of death, the convergence is mainly attributable to external causes, while the inter-regional divergence of trends is largely determined by cardiovascular diseases. The two major cities, Moscow and Saint Petersburg, are currently pioneering mortality improvements in Russia and are making the largest contributions to the inter-regional divergence. © 2017, The Author(s).",Causes of death; Decomposition; Mortality disparities; Regions of Russia,algorithm; cardiovascular disease; elderly population; mortality; population decline; trend analysis; young population; Leningrad; Moscow [Moscow (ADS)]; Moscow [Russian Federation]; Russian Federation; Saint Petersburg,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034645837

Rationales for e-Government include increasing public services’ efficiency, speed, transparency, accountability, etc., and enhancing relations between government and stakeholders (citizens, businesses, third sector organisations). e-Government programmes are large-scale innovation projects; and Future-oriented Technology Analysis, FTA, is often used in the design of public policies in science, technology and innovation. FTA tools allow for systematic appraisal of potential challenges, opportunities, and threats, and thus informing the design of long-term strategies. The aim of this paper is to examine what a systematic literature review tells us about the application of FTA to support e-Government planning, implementation or evaluation. The review confirms that FTA played a role in supporting some e-Government initiatives, especially in their planning stages. However, few relevant exercises of this sort are reported in the English language, though the e-Government literature itself in that language- is voluminous. Previous researchers often attribute weaknesses in e-Government efforts to deficiencies in vision and strategic planning. Hopefully, this review can encourage both FTA and e-Government practitioners to apply FTA to e-Government development. This suggests that there is both opportunity and need to take greater advantage of FTA in this field. © 2017, The Author(s).",Digital government; e-Government; Foresight; Future-oriented technology analysis; Open government,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041623584

The findings are explained in the context of two theories of internal colonization, Marxist and post-colonial. Earlier, Rossman described five concepts of Moscow-phobia based on territorial economic inequalities and the political hegemony of the center. This study complements the list with the new forms, as the participants express their anxiety centered on the cultural distance and the domination of province.

To our knowledge, no explicit quantification of the changes in regional population aging differentiation exist. We investigate how regional differences in population aging developed over the last decade and how they are likely to evolve in the coming three decades, and we examine how demographic components of population growth contribute to the process. We use the beta-convergence approach to test whether regions are moving towards a common level of population aging. The change in population composition is decomposed into the separate effects of changes in the size of the non-working-age population and of the working-age population. The latter changes are further decomposed into the effects of cohort turnover, migration at working ages, and mortality at working ages. European Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)-2 regions experienced notable convergence in population aging during the period 2003–2012 and are expected to experience further convergence in the coming three decades. Convergence in aging mainly depends on changes in the population structure of East-European regions. Cohort turnover plays the major role in promoting convergence. Differences in mortality at working ages, though quite moderate themselves, have a significant cumulative effect. The projections show that when it is assumed that net migration flows at working ages are converging across European regions, this will not contribute to convergence of population aging. The beta-convergence approach proves useful to examine regional variations in population aging across Europe. © The Author(s). 2017.",Beta convergence; Cohort turnover; Demographic decomposition; Migration at working ages; Mortality at working ages; NUTS-2; Population aging; Population structures; Total support ratio,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032971716

The authors of the article do not share this view. They explain that liberal world order does not exist and never existed. It is not more than an ideological construct, which is tremendously beneficial to its designers and supporters, giving excuses and rationale for intervening, imposing and suppressing. It is proved by evidences taken from the present day functioning of world economy and world politics as well as from what is going on in the USA and the EU countries. What exists at the national, transnational and world level is a liberal cluster. It is in permanent competition with a lot of others. Lately, the liberal cluster was less successful than ever. Its inability to win the competition is exacerbated by the permanent crisis it tries to cope with. The challenge of populism, extreme right and left movements, low growth, etc. had a tremendous impact on it. To survive, it has started to change and evolve towards populist and nationalist liberalism. Political systems of the USA and a number of European countries have proved to be very flexible. They have absorbed the shock of change and new social and economic trends. But at the international level, such flexibility is lacking entirely. The inability of populist and nationalist liberal cluster to adapt to new reality generates international tensions, conflicts, uncertainty. This is a road to nowhere. If this reality is acknowledged it will pave the way for an entirely new understanding of transformational processes the USA and the EU countries are undergoing now. It will provide everybody with an opportunity to develop new approaches to international relations and common future. In such a way, international tensions could be eased, making international relations much more reliable, rational and comfortable.

Here we experimentally demonstrate that in single-crystalline semimetal bismuth nanostructures the electronic conductivity non-monotonously decreases with reduction of the effective diameter. In samples grown along the particular crystallographic orientation the electronic conductivity abruptly increases at scales of about 50 nm due to metal-to-insulator transition mediated by the quantum confinement effect. The experimental findings are in reasonable agreement with theory predictions.

Here, we investigated the changes in EEG patterns during a continuously administered neurofeedback of P4 alpha activity. Two days of neurofeedback training were sufficient for a significant increase in the alpha power to occur. A detailed analysis of these EEG changes showed that the alpha power rose because of an increase in the incidence rate of alpha episodes, whereas the amplitude and the duration of alpha oscillations remained unchanged. These findings suggest that neurofeedback facilitates volitional control of alpha activity onset, but alpha episodes themselves appear to be maintained automatically with no volitional control- A property overlooked by previous studies that employed continuous alpha-power neurofeedback.

Generation of spin waves by ultrashort laser pulses provides several important advances with respect to conventional approaches using microwaves. In particular, focused laser spot works as a point source for spin waves and allows for directional control of spin waves and switching between their different types. For further progress in this direction it is important to manipulate with the spectrum of the optically generated spin waves. Here we tackle this problem by launching spin waves by a sequence of femtosecond laser pulses with pulse interval much shorter than the relaxation time of the magnetization oscillations. This leads to the cumulative phenomenon and allows us to generate magnons in a specific narrow range of wavenumbers. The wavelength of spin waves can be tuned from 15 μm to hundreds of microns by sweeping the external magnetic field by only 10 Oe or by slight variation of the pulse repetition rate. Our findings expand the capabilities of the optical spin pump-probe technique and provide a new method for the spin wave generation and control. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025140667

The most common causes for liver cancer include hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol use. OBJECTIVE: To report results of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 study on primary liver cancer incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 195 countries or territories from 1990 to 2015, and present global, regional, and national estimates on the burden of liver cancer attributable to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and an ""other"" group that encompasses residual causes. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: Mortality was estimated using vital registration and cancer registry data in an ensemble modeling approach. Single-cause mortality estimates were adjusted for all-cause mortality. Incidence was derived from mortality estimates and the mortality-to-incidence ratio. Through a systematic literature review, data on the proportions of liver cancer due to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and other causes were identified. Years of life lost were calculated by multiplying each death by a standard life expectancy. Prevalence was estimated using mortality-to-incidence ratio as surrogate for survival. Total prevalence was divided into 4 sequelae that were multiplied by disability weights to derive years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were the sum of years of life lost and YLDs. MAIN OUTCOMESAND MEASURES: Liver cancer mortality, incidence, YLDs, years of life lost, DALYs by etiology, age, sex, country, and year. RESULTS: There were 854 000 incident cases of liver cancer and 810 000 deaths globally in 2015, contributing to 20 578 000 DALYs. Cases of incident liver cancer increased by 75% between 1990 and 2015, of which 47% can be explained by changing population age structures, 35% by population growth, and -8% to changing age-specific incidence rates. The male-to-female ratio for age-standardized liver cancer mortality was 2.8. Globally, HBV accounted for 265 000 liver cancer deaths (33%), alcohol for 245 000 (30%), HCV for 167 000 (21%), and other causes for 133 000 (16%) deaths, with substantial variation between countries in the underlying etiologies. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Liver cancer is among the leading causes of cancer deaths in many countries. Causes of liver cancer differ widely among populations. Our results show that most cases of liver cancer can be prevented through vaccination, antiviral treatment, safe blood transfusion and injection practices, as well as interventions to reduce excessive alcohol use. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, the identification and elimination of risk factors for liver cancer will be required to achieve a sustained reduction in liver cancer burden. The GBD study can be used to guide these prevention efforts.",,Article; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer risk; controlled study; disability-adjusted life year; disease burden; female; human; life expectancy; liver cancer; male; population growth; practice guideline; prevalence; sex difference; standardization; trend study,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038607469

QSEs manifest themselves as non-monotonic dependencies of various material properties as function of relevant dimension. QSE should be particularly noticeable in materials with charge carrier(s) effective mass less than the free electron mass. Bismuth is one of the most suitable semi-metal to observe QSE due to small effective masses and small the Fermi energy. However, bismuth has a high anisotropic energy spectrum. Hence to observe QSE which can be interpreted with reasonable accuracy, it is mandatory to fabricate single-crystal nanostructure with known orientation of crystallographic axes. In this paper several short bismuth nanowires (nanorods) were investigated, and oscillating dependence of electric resistance on effective cross section was found. Theoretical calculations provide a reasonable agreement with experiment. The quantum-size phenomena are important for operation of a wide spectrum of nanolelectronic devices. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Bismuth; Crystal orientation; Electrons; Nanorods; Conduction electrons; Crystallographic axes; De Broglie wavelength; Effective cross sections; Quantum size effects; Reasonable accuracy; Single-crystalline bismuth; Theoretical calculations; Single crystals,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039035369

Bacterial genes belonging to same metabolic pathway are often co-localized in the chromosome, but it is not a strict rule. Gene co-localization in linked to co-evolution and co-regulation. This study focuses on a large-scale analysis of bacterial genomic loci related to the carbohydrate metabolism. Results: We demonstrate that only 53% of 148,000 studied genes from over six hundred bacterial genomes are co-localized in bacterial genomes with other carbohydrate metabolism genes, which points to a significant role of singleton genes. Co-localized genes form cassettes, ranging in size from two to fifteen genes. Two major factors influencing the cassette-forming tendency are gene function and bacterial phylogeny. We have obtained a comprehensive picture of co-localization preferences of genes for nineteen major carbohydrate metabolism functional classes, over two hundred gene orthologous clusters, and thirty bacterial classes, and characterized the cassette variety in size and content among different species, highlighting a significant role of short cassettes. The preference towards co-localization of carbohydrate metabolism genes varies between 40 and 76% for bacterial taxa. Analysis of frequently co-localized genes yielded forty-five significant pairwise links between genes belonging to different functional classes. The number of such links per class range from zero to eight, demonstrating varying preferences of respective genes towards a specific chromosomal neighborhood. Genes from eleven functional classes tend to co-localize with genes from the same class, indicating an important role of clustering of genes with similar functions. At that, in most cases such co-localization does not originate from local duplication events. Conclusions: Overall, we describe a complex web formed by evolutionary relationships of bacterial carbohydrate metabolism genes, manifested as co-localization patterns.

Jupyter notebooks are a powerful platform for conducting research in a collaborative manner. We present project Everware that seamlessly integrates git repository management systems such as Github or Gitlab, Docker and Jupyter helping with a) sharing results of real research and b) boosts education activities.

DQM at LHCb is carried out in two phases. The first one is performed on-site, in real time, using unprocessed data directly from the LHCb detector, while the second, also performed on-site, requires the reconstruction of the data selected by the LHCb trigger system and occurs later. For the LHC Run II data taking the LHCb collaboration has re-engineered the DQM protocols and the DQM graphical interface, moving the latter to a web-based monitoring system, called Monet, thus allowing researchers to perform the second phase off-site. In order to support the operator's task, Monet is also equipped with an automated, fully configurable alarm system, thus allowing its use not only for DQM purposes, but also to track and assess the quality of LHCb software and simulation over time. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Alarm systems; Computer software; High energy physics; Middleware; Data quality; Experimental apparatus; Graphical interface; High energy physics experiments; Real time; Second phase; Trigger systems; Web-based monitoring; Monitoring,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039441453

Upon interacting with Earth's atmosphere, these events produce extensive particle showers which can be detected by cameras on mobile phones. A typical shower contains minimally-ionizing particles such as muons. As these particles interact with CMOS image sensors, they may leave tracks of faintly-activated pixels that are sometimes hard to distinguish from random detector noise. Triggers that rely on the presence of very bright pixels within an image frame are not efficient in this case. We present a trigger algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Networks which selects images containing such tracks and are evaluated in a lazy manner: the response of each successive layer is computed only if activation of the current layer satisfies a continuation criterion. Usage of neural networks increases the sensitivity considerably comparable with image thresholding, while the lazy evaluation allows for execution of the trigger under the limited computational power of mobile phones. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Cellular telephones; Charged particles; Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Earth atmosphere; Mobile devices; Mobile phones; Neural networks; Pixels; Telephone sets; CMOS image sensor; Computational power; Convolutional neural network; Image thresholding; Ionizing particles; Lazy evaluation; Trigger algorithms; Ultra high-energy cosmic rays; High energy physics,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038443795

While such approaches are quite successful, they are not particularly well suited for parallelization as the chain dynamics is sequential, and if replicated chains are used to increase statistics each of them relaxes into equilibrium with an intrinsic time constant that cannot be reduced by parallel work. Population annealing is a sequential Monte Carlo method that simulates an ensemble of system replica under a cooling protocol. The population element makes it naturally well suited for massively parallel simulations, and bias can be systematically reduced by increasing the population size.

Particular attention to non-cash money is determined by the hypothesis that, in the era of an electronic economy, when money becomes more and more abstract and invisible, financial management practices (i.e., the ways people control and distribute their resources) could change [Pahl 1999 a]. The goal of the research was achieved through the deployment of qualitative sociological methods: 20 semi-structured interviews were held with partners living together for more than half a year (married or cohabiting); therefore, 10 households were included in the final sample. The subsequent data analysis led to the following conclusions: The peculiarities of managing non-cash money in a household are determined by reproducing habitual patterns in new formats using new ways, services, and opportunities with which people are provided in an electronic economy. These new formats can be very unique with respect to reproducing household financial allocative systems (provided by Pahl and Vogler), the ways financial power is allocated, and the schemes for accessing partners’ finances and regulations in an electronic economy and in terms of meanings ascribed to the distribution of new money forms.",Electronic economy; Family budget; Financial power within households; Household financial allocative systems; Non-cash money; Practices of financial management,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036526139

We assess the (in)consistency between their representations and the reflection of these representations in the characteristics of existing organizations of social entrepreneurship (social enterprises). Business, government and NPOs are understood as external actors of social enterprise legitimation, as without their recognition the legitimation will not take place. In turn, social enterprises, regardless of whether they come from for-profit or non-profit sector, are seen as the objects of legitimation, or as a new actor, not identical to any of the above. It is shown that the contradictions in the positions of the key actors can lead to the mutually exclusive projects of legitimation of a new phenomenon, so that they will undermine the cognitive and moral legitimacy of each other.

In particular, it addresses the following set of questions: How are objective and subjective mobility related to redistributive preferences? How are redistributive preferences connected with mechanisms of mobility and feelings of fairness? The author uses large cross-country datasets from the ISSP to analyze connections between redistributive preferences and objective and subjective mobility on different levels (intra and between countries). Using regression analysis, the author finds that objective and subjective mobility influence redistributive preferences in different ways. Objective mobility has only weak effects on redistributive preferences, whereas the connection between subjective mobility and the demand for redistribution is much stronger and more stable. Cross-country analysis shows that the connection between redistributive preferences and subjective mobility is higher in transition economies than in developed countries. In addition, the author finds that preferences for redistribution are strongly linked to how transparent and fair mobility is. If people feel there is equality in opportunities, their demands for redistribution are significantly lower.",Corruption; Cross country data; Fairness; Objective mobility; Perception of mobility; Redistributive preferences; Social mobility,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036578986

the global and country-specific burden of neurological disorders and their trends are crucial for health-care planning and resource allocation. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study provides such information but does not routinely aggregate results that are of interest to clinicians specialising in neurological conditions. In this systematic analysis, we quantified the global disease burden due to neurological disorders in 2015 and its relationship with country development level. Methods We estimated global and country-specific prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) for various neurological disorders that in the GBD classification have been previously spread across multiple disease groupings. The more inclusive grouping of neurological disorders included stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, tetanus, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, migraine, tension-type headache, medication overuse headache, brain and nervous system cancers, and a residual category of other neurological disorders. We also analysed results based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility, to identify patterns associated with development and how countries fare against expected outcomes relative to their level of development. Findings Neurological disorders ranked as the leading cause group of DALYs in 2015 (250·7 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) 229·1 to 274·7] million, comprising 10·2% of global DALYs) and the second-leading cause group of deaths (9·4 [9·1 to 9·7] million], comprising 16·8% of global deaths). The most prevalent neurological disorders were tension-type headache (1505·9 [UI 1337·3 to 1681·6 million cases]), migraine (958·8 [872·1 to 1055·6] million), medication overuse headache (58·5 [50·8 to 67·4 million]), and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (46·0 [40·2 to 52·7 million]). Between 1990 and 2015, the number of deaths from neurological disorders increased by 36·7%, and the number of DALYs by 7·4%. These increases occurred despite decreases in age-standardised rates of death and DALYs of 26·1% and 29·7%, respectively; stroke and communicable neurological disorders were responsible for most of these decreases. Communicable neurological disorders were the largest cause of DALYs in countries with low SDI. Stroke rates were highest at middle levels of SDI and lowest at the highest SDI. Most of the changes in DALY rates of neurological disorders with development were driven by changes in YLLs. Interpretation Neurological disorders are an important cause of disability and death worldwide. Globally, the burden of neurological disorders has increased substantially over the past 25 years because of expanding population numbers and ageing, despite substantial decreases in mortality rates from stroke and communicable neurological disorders. The number of patients who will need care by clinicians with expertise in neurological conditions will continue to grow in coming decades. Policy makers and health-care providers should be aware of these trends to provide adequate services. Funding Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This approach is used also for a system of closely located atoms in the usual (non-chiral) waveguide or in 3D space. Moreover, it is shown that for an arbitrary atomic system with a cascade spontaneous radiative decay, the fluorescence spectrum can be described by an exact analytic expression which accounts for interference of emitted photons.

That strategy is also hampered by high institutional barriers, which are a consequence of both the archaic institutions within the country and the properties of a global innovation system, which remains highly dependent on international politics. Consequently, international channels of technological transfer became increasingly ineffective and they are in need of restricting for the new challenges of national development. The article assesses the opportunities for implementing the catchingup strategy through introduction of changes in the mechanisms of interfirm and international diffusion of innovations. An attempt is made to reveal new directions in international technology transfer. The article, therefore, produced the scholarly justification for the choice of particular transfer channels, for which it is possible to eliminate or reduce institutional barriers and to correct the directions of external relations. The transmission channels of implicit knowledge, including the mobility of scientific and engineering personnel, is argued to play the leading role in this process. The advantages of a partial reorientation of technology transfer from the West to the East are shown, in particular, by the example of the Chinese catchup strategy. © 2017 Academic Educational Forum on International Relations.

Why, then, in recent years, have so many historical and anthropological studies of Russia excluded Marxist from the list of main descriptors, or optics, through which they view their material? In this essay, I argue that in much contemporary scholarship Marxism and its many afterlives have evidenced a kind of blind spot, reducing Marxism to just an ideology. I assert that rediscovering the presence of Marxism in Russia as a Gramscian hegemonic process and a vernacular that emerged among laymen can help us understand how a wide range of Russians continue to make sense of their worlds today. Drawing on several years of research in the city of Perm, I interpret everyday conversations among middle-age urbanites about morality, and demonstrate how this rediscovery of Marxism can elucidate what things matter for Russians today, and how. If social scientists proceed by acknowledging that professional and lay social knowledge increasingly share sources of theoretical inspiration, then we face a range of narrative challenges.

We develop a model of this wave phenomenon which assumes (as, in general, has been suggested long ago) that the observed spectrum is excited due to loss cone instability of energetic ions in the equatorial region of the magnetosphere. The wavefield is represented as a sum of constant frequency wave packets which cross a number of cyclotron resonances while propagating in a highly oblique mode along quite specific trajectories. The growth (damping) rate of these wave packets varies both in sign and magnitude along the raypath, making the wave net amplification, but not the growth rate, the main characteristic of the wave generation process. The growth rates and the wave amplitudes along the ray paths, determined by the equations of geometrical optics, have been calculated for a 3-D set of wave packets with various frequencies, initial L shells, and initial wave normal angles at the equator. It is shown that the dynamical spectrum resulting from the proposed model qualitatively matches observations. ©2017.

Depending on the phonological context, participants were expected to either delete vowels (e.g. ko'mokNom,sg - kom'kaGen,sg) or preserve them (e.g. pji'lotNom,sg - pji'lotaGen,sg). The results showed that children's sensitivity to morphophonological patterns increases with age: 4-year-olds tended to preserve underlying vowels and stress across conditions, whereas older children demonstrated growing accuracy, at least with real words. Stressed vowels were more appropriately alternated and preserved across conditions, suggesting suprasegmental effects on the acquisition of segmental alternation patterns in Russian. © 2017 SAGE Publications.",L1 acquisition; morphophonology; nomimal declension; Russian; segmental alternations; stress patterns,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029484693

Aims and Objectives: To determine the quality of existing stroke-care services in LMICs and to highlight indigenous, inexpensive, evidence-based implementable strategies being used in stroke-care. Methods: A detailed literature search was undertaken using PubMed and Google scholar from January 1966 to October 2015 using a range of search terms. Of 921 publications, 373 papers were shortlisted and 31 articles on existing stroke-services were included. Results: We identified efficient models of ambulance transport and pre-notification. Stroke Units (SU) are available in some countries, but are relatively sparse and mostly provided by the private sector. Very few patients were thrombolysed; this could be increased with telemedicine and governmental subsidies. Adherence to secondary preventive drugs is affected by limited availability and affordability, emphasizing the importance of primary prevention. Training of paramedics, care-givers and nurses in post-stroke care is feasible. Conclusion: In this systematic review, we found several reports on evidence-based implementable stroke services in LMICs. Some strategies are economic, feasible and reproducible but remain untested. Data on their outcomes and sustainability is limited. Further research on implementation of locally and regionally adapted stroke-services and cost-effective secondary prevention programs should be a priority. © 2017 S.

Each agent may invest a part of her endowment (it may be, for instance, time or money) in the first of two time periods; consumption in the second period depends on her own investment and productivity as well as on the investments of her neighbors in the network. Three ways of agent’s behavior are possible: passive (no investment), active (a part of endowment is invested), and hyperactive (the whole endowment is invested). For star network with different productivities of agents in the center and in the periphery, we obtain conditions for existence of inner equilibrium (with all active agents) and study comparative statics. We introduce adjustment dynamics and study consequences of junction of two complete networks with different productivities of agents. In particular, we study how the behavior of nonadopters (passive agents) changes when they connect to adopters (active or hyperactive) agents. © The Author(s) 2017.",game equilibrium; heterogeneous agents; Network; network formation; productivity,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039838930

A series of reforms have promoted fostering and family-like care in contrast to the large residential homes used in the Soviet period and 1990's. We highlight the fundamental change in the 'ideal of care' represented by the move to 'deinstitutionalise' the care system by promoting domestic adoptions, increasing the number of foster families, creating early support services for families as well as restructuring remaining residential institutions into smaller, home-like environments. These are all key elements of the global deinstitutionalisation trend that is taking place around the globe. We look at the evolution of the related policies and ask why this policy shift happened during the 2010's even though the issue of reform had partially been on the Russian policy agenda for some time. Building on an explanatory approach to family policy changes by Magritta Mäztke and Ilona Ostner, which incorporates material and ideational driving forces, we explain that the 'political will from above' behind these major reforms was shaped by a range of other societal and political factors. Multiple factors drove Russian political actors to adopt new ideas about care for children left without parental care. For instance, the increasing conservative turn in policies towards children and families, which are driven by the severe demographic decline in the country, work alongside the influence of international norms around children's rights and changing socio-economic circumstances. In the 1990's Russian NGOs had considerable input into the reforms as 'epistemic communities' in policy formation thanks to the high level of expertise that they developed in international networks and the increasing number of cross-sector consultative platforms at governmental bodies in contemporary Russia. We conclude that ideational factors were necessary preconditions for the reforms, but that political forces were ultimately the key driving force. The recentralisation of power and prioritisation of social policy under President Putin allowed new ideas to gain concrete policy realisation. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.",Child welfare; Deinstitutionalisation; Family policy; Substitute care,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029909849

The study aimed to obtain analytical information on the socio-psychological and professional adaptation of children from Russian Orphanages. Using the automated media monitoring system 'Medialogia', the authors analyze thematic publications from seven Russian regions: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Irkutsk, Kaliningrad, Novosibirsk, Tver, and Yaroslavl. Textual analysis is based on one hundred articles selected as they enjoy the highest rating of re-quoting and republishing. A thematic map of topics constructed within this analysis shows that the main body of publications is focused on issues of compliance and violation of the orphan rights and the provision of benefits, including housing. Also attracting attention are government, NGOs and private volunteer initiatives in organising adaptation programs for orphans. On the basis of these textual materials, we have developed a thematic typology of media representations of this social group. The following types were unearthed: a positive-independent (successfully adapted and self-made orphanage graduates), a positive-passive (so-called 'adult children'), the negative-independent ('deviants') and negative-passive (orphanhood as a social stigma). What becomes clear is that 'positive-passive' media images are the most common in the printed media at the current moment. This stigmatises orphanage graduates, positioning them as not adapted to 'real' life. The positive-independent media image occurs more rarely, usually only in the context of an orphanage graduate building a successful career. This image corresponds to specific individual biographies, while other media images tend to be devoid of personality or gender characteristics. This, the media forms a 'typical' path in the socialisation of orphan graduates that does not take into account modern pedagogical and psychological practices. These practices are associated with the individual work of educators and social workers with the orphans, who work to prepare children for release from an orphanage or boarding school. The analysis in this paper suggests that the main body of materials on orphanage graduates does not reflect the diversity of problems and challenges faced by this category of citizens. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.",A graduate from orphanage; Orphans; Social adaptation; Social service,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029908745

It examines the socio-demographic characteristics of middle-income groups and pays attention to household characteristics in terms of the potential risks of economic instability. Middle-income groups are determined according to relative measuring of social stratification through comparing average household income with the country median of this indicator. It is shown that the middle-income strata, being heterogeneous, are divided into two fundamentally separate groups with remarkably different levels of exposure to economic risks. Moreover, the conditional division of the population as a whole lies between these two groups. The lower part of this strata, despite their income meeting the 'national average' level, is on the verge of vulnerability, and, thus, is sensitive to socio-economic instability. Its socio-demographic factors, including family structure (high dependency ratio, large percentage of non-working pensioners, etc.), cause additional risks. The upper segment of the middle-income strata is in a much more favourable situation not only according to incomes, but also due the fact they enjoy relatively stable positions in the labour market. It is shown that having a family entails an additional risk of low status for both subgroups of middle-income Russians, something that is primarily due to the dependency load. The degree of this risk is slightly mitigated for the lower segment of the strata because they are better integrated into social support systems. For the upper segment of the strata, the general resources of the family play this role. The extended family can be seen as a possible resource of support for the middle-income groups, but this is limited by the objective capabilities of related networks and the nature of the relationships. In this regard, the potential of support for the lower segment of the middle-income group is significantly lower than for the upper one, and this increases the differentiation of their position during crisis. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.",Dependency ratio; Family; Middle-income groups; Vulnerable population groups,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029895405

While the receptor mechanisms of nicotine have been identified, the circuit level mechanisms by which it usurps dopamine signaling are still not completely clear. In this chapter we describe two modeling approaches: the first is a receptor-circuit model of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the second is a more detailed modeling of dopamine neuron spiking. Using the circuit model we show that nicotine-evoked upregulation of receptors on the VTA γ-amino butyric acid neurons is a sufficient mechanism for alterations in dopaminergic signaling. Crucially the model points out how nicotine may act to renormalize the otherwise pathological dopamine circuitry in individuals with substance use disorders. In the second approach we show that nicotine-driven increases in glutamate input synchrony to the dopamine neurons induce bursting and hence increased phasic dopamine release. We discuss open questions and ways for models to delineate the mechanisms of nicotine control over motivational signals in the brain. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specifc mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods: We estimated cause-specifc deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specifc causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specifc deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings: The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2-73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3% (18·5-20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43% (8·00-8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16 - age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL signifcantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59%) during the same interval. Globally, the fve leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a fner level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation: The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and confict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might refect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which efective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of risk factor exposure and attributable burden of disease. By providing estimates over a long time series, this study can monitor risk exposure trends critical to health surveillance and inform policy debates on the importance of addressing risks in context. Methods: We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2016. This study included 481 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk (RR) and exposure estimates from 22 717 randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources, according to the GBD 2016 source counting methods. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. Finally, we explored four drivers of trends in attributable burden: population growth, population ageing, trends in risk exposure, and all other factors combined. Findings: Since 1990, exposure increased significantly for 30 risks, did not change significantly for four risks, and decreased significantly for 31 risks. Among risks that are leading causes of burden of disease, child growth failure and household air pollution showed the most significant declines, while metabolic risks, such as body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose, showed significant increases. In 2016, at Level 3 of the hierarchy, the three leading risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs at the global level for men were smoking (124.1 million DALYs [95% UI 111.2 million to 137.0 million]), high systolic blood pressure (122.2 million DALYs [110.3 million to 133.3 million], and low birthweight and short gestation (83.0 million DALYs [78.3 million to 87.7 million]), and for women, were high systolic blood pressure (89.9 million DALYs [80.9 million to 98.2 million]), high body-mass index (64.8 million DALYs [44.4 million to 87.6 million]), and high fasting plasma glucose (63.8 million DALYs [53.2 million to 76.3 million]). In 2016 in 113 countries, the leading risk factor in terms of attributable DALYs was a metabolic risk factor. Smoking remained among the leading five risk factors for DALYs for 109 countries, while low birthweight and short gestation was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 38 countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In terms of important drivers of change in trends of burden attributable to risk factors, between 2006 and 2016 exposure to risks explains an 9.3% (6.9-11.6) decline in deaths and a 10.8% (8.3-13.1) decrease in DALYs at the global level, while population ageing accounts for 14.9% (12.7-17.5) of deaths and 6.2% (3.9-8.7) of DALYs, and population growth for 12.4% (10.1-14.9) of deaths and 12.4% (10.1-14.9) of DALYs. The largest contribution of trends in risk exposure to disease burden is seen between ages 1 year and 4 years, where a decline of 27.3% (24.9-29.7) of the change in DALYs between 2006 and 2016 can be attributed to declines in exposure to risks. Interpretation: Increasingly detailed understanding of the trends in risk exposure and the RRs for each risk-outcome pair provide insights into both the magnitude of health loss attributable to risks and how modification of risk exposure has contributed to health trends. Metabolic risks warrant particular policy attention, due to their large contribution to global disease burden, increasing trends, and variable patterns across countries at the same level of development. GBD 2016 findings show that, while it has huge potential to improve health, risk modification has played a relatively small part in the past decade. © The Author(s).

Development Goals (SDGs) are grounded in the global ambition of ""leaving no one behind"". Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030. Methods: We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 25th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 975th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment. Findings Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 567 (IQR 319-668) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (868, 95% uncertainty interval 846-889), Iceland (860, 841-876), and Sweden (856, 818-878) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (109, 96-119), the Central African Republic (110, 88-138), and Somalia (113, 95-131) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past. Interpretation GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases and injuries are becoming a larger component of the global burden of disease. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. Methods We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57·6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 40·8-75·9 million [7·2%, 6·0-8·3]), 45·1 million (29·0-62·8 million [5·6%, 4·0-7·2]), 36·3 million (25·3-50·9 million [4·5%, 3·8-5·3]), 34·7 million (23·0-49·6 million [4·3%, 3·5-5·2]), and 34·1 million (23·5-46·0 million [4·2%, 3·2-5·3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2·7% (95% UI 2·3-3·1). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10·4% (95% UI 9·0-11·8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95% UI 6862-11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018-19 228). Interpretation The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-todate information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response. © The Author(s).

changes in health across locations is useful to compare and contrast changing epidemiological patterns against health system performance and identify specific needs for resource allocation in research, policy development, and programme decision making. Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we drew from two widely used summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with expected trends on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Methods: We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost and years of life lived with disability for each location, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using age-specific death rates and years of life lived with disability per capita. We explored how DALYs and HALE difered from expected trends when compared with the SDI: the geometric mean of income per person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and total fertility rate. Findings: The highest globally observed HALE at birth for both women and men was in Singapore, at 75·2 years (95% uncertainty interval 71·9-78·6) for females and 72·0 years (68·8-75·1) for males. The lowest for females was in the Central African Republic (45·6 years [42·0-49·5]) and for males was in Lesotho (41·5 years [39·0-44·0]). From 1990 to 2016, global HALE increased by an average of 6·24 years (5·97-6·48) for both sexes combined. Global HALE increased by 6·04 years (5·74-6·27) for males and 6·49 years (6·08-6·77) for females, whereas HALE at age 65 years increased by 1·78 years (1·61-1·93) for males and 1·96 years (1·69-2·13) for females. Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2016 (-2·3% [-5·9 to 0·9]), with decreases in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disease DALYs ofset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The exemplars, calculated as the fve lowest ratios of observed to expected age-standardised DALY rates in 2016, were Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Peru, and Israel. The leading three causes of DALYs globally were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infections, comprising 16·1% of all DALYs. Total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most CMNN causes decreased from 1990 to 2016. Conversely, the total DALY burden rose for most NCDs; however, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined globally. Interpretation: At a global level, DALYs and HALE continue to show improvements. At the same time, we observe that many populations are facing growing functional health loss. Rising SDI was associated with increases in cumulative years of life lived with disability and decreases in CMNN DALYs ofset by increased NCD DALYs. Relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued health interventions, which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross domestic product per person, education, and family planning. The analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework with which to benchmark location-specific health performance. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform health policies, health system improvement initiatives, targeted prevention eforts, and development assistance for health, including fnancial and research investments for all countries, regardless of their level of sociodemographic development. The presence of countries that substantially outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples of best practices, which can help to extend gains, whereas the presence of underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to health systems that need more robust support. © The Author(s).

of mortality patterns, particularly age-specific mortality, represent a crucial input that enables health systems to target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. Methods: We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0.5% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. Findings: Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates - a measure of relative inequality - increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86.9 years (95% UI 86.7-87.2), and for men in Singapore, at 81.3 years (78.8-83.7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. Interpretation Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.

The events that were metaphorically called the “Arab Spring” referring to the “Spring of Nations” of 1848, affected virtually all countries of the Middle East and North Africa. In Libya, Syria, and Yemen, antigovernment demonstrations led to almost complete destruction of statehood raising the question of the existence of these political entities in their former borders. Egypt and Tunisia ended up with a change in the ruling regimes that repeated many times. The ruling elites of other Arab countries, having experienced the wrath of the Arab streets to varying degrees, managed to stay in power. The “Arab Spring” events should be more adequately viewed in the framework of “fitnah”, a form of protest traditional in the Arab-Muslim political culture. Indeed, since the emergence of Islam, fitnah was one of the most common forms of protest activity in the Middle East. However, in the last two centuries, it was replaced by “thaura” or the “revolution,” much more common in the European mentality. While the term ""fitnah"" has mainly negative connotations, “thaura” has been praised in every possible way and even became the basis for commemorative practices. This paper makes an attempt to compare these two forms of protest in the Muslim world. © 2017 by the authors.

We demonstrate that doping a spin-density wave insulator in the weak-coupling regime may also stabilize half-metallic states. In the absence of doping, the spin-density wave is formed by four nested bands [i.e., each band is characterized by charge (electron or hole) and spin (up or down) labels]. Of these four bands, only two accumulate the charge carriers introduced by doping, forming a half-metallic two-valley Fermi surface. Depending on the parameters, the spin polarizations of the electronlike and holelike valleys may be either (i) parallel or (ii) antiparallel. The Fermi surface of (i) is fully spin polarized (similar to usual half-metals). Case (ii), referred to as ""a spin-valley half-metal,"" corresponds to complete polarization with respect to the spin-valley operator.

These results became a trigger for the subsequent discussion about the gap between objective and subjective measures of well-being. In particular, there is still no consensus on the explanatory mechanism underlying the relationship between objective and subjective well-being. The analysis of transition economies and developing countries gives inconsistent and contradictory results. In this paper, I consider not only the original interpretation of the Easterlin paradox that is true only for the aggregated national level. This paper traces the discussion about the gap between objective and subjective well-being on both national and individual levels. This study aims to define relevant research strategies that explain why the inferences about the relationship between economic well-being and its perception are inconsistent. At the beginning of the paper, I address the origins of the academic discussion on subjective well-being and explain why different disciplines study subjective well-being. The following part of the paper describes briefly the key stages of the discussion to expose the main arguments. The review of key studies allows me to find the obstacles to reaching the consensus on the type of relationship between objective and subjective well-being. In the final part, the author reflects on the research strategies that explain why the effect of economic indicators on subjective well-being varies in different studies. © 2017 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

At the same time, the majority of studies are focused on one particular form of leisure such as cultural consumption, sports or gastronomic preferences while neglecting the structure of leisure activities on the whole. Furthermore, the results of the analysis of the impact of social determinants vary depending on the social context. The aim of this study is to reveal the structure of public leisure practices in Russia as well as social characteristics that shape these leisure practices. The study is based on the data provided by the Public Opinion Foundation. Using latent class analysis and multinomial logistic regression, the author offers five repertoires of leisure activities. The study shows that income, education, age and place of living also shape the leisure patterns.",Leisure; Leisure in Russia; Leisure structure; Public leisure practices; Social stratification; Symbolic inequality,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037043751

One of the major features of mediatization is a shift in media discourse towards more entertaining reporting consisting in simplification and superficialism in political media coverage. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mediatization of politics concerning the Scottish media coverage of the independence referendum. The content analysis of the local newspapers revealed emotionalism with a special emphasis on the conflict between supporters and opponents of Scottish independence. However, despite substantial changes that an independent Scotland might have had, the media were lacking analytical approach to the coverage of vital political, economic and social issues. Thus, the media coverage format consistent with the process of mediatization restricted the perception of the discussed problems in the print media.

The study is based upon the analysis of two waves of the «Comprehensive monitoring of living conditions» conducted by the Federal State Statistics Service in 2011 and 2014. The three-year-long study shows that the job satisfaction levels among men and women have increased. Men are more satisfied with salaries, whereas women feel happier with other aspects such as job security, job requirements, working hours, working conditions, and distance between home and workplace. In other words, there is a gender paradox in Russia: all other factors being equal, Russian women are more satisfied with work than men. However, there are no significant differences in terms of professional and moral fulfillment. Social and demographic characteristics have almost the same impact on various aspects of job satisfaction for both men and women but certain differences do exist. Men and women without higher education diplomas are less satisfied with all job aspects except for distance from home to work. Compared with permanent contract employees, temporary contract employees and employees without a written contract are less happy with various aspects of job, especially job security. At the same time, the employment without a written contract can influence job satisfaction only among men. With aging, both men and women are more satisfied with various job aspects, though there are certain age-based differences.

The second most commonly used frame is «neutral» frame used by those authors who try to be non-judgmental and whose news reporting is limited to fact-based information. The frames of moral and equality, mainly typical for the American media, are rare in the Russian media. The moral frame refers to ethical and religious condemnation of same-sex marriage.

The author considers criticism over this discipline. Based on the analysis of the debate over the «death of deviance», the author concludes that the discipline needs to be revised. Hence, there is a tendency toward defining deviance as a neutral notion (such as «non-conventional» behavior) and an attempt to turn the discipline from self-sustainable into «a tool aimed to improve the sensitivity» of social researcher.

However, there is not enough clarity regarding the links between statistical domains. The relations between different-type summaries (numerosity and the mean) are of particular interest, since they can shed light on (1) a very general functional organization of ensemble processing and (2) mechanisms of statistical computations (whether averaging takes into account numerical information, as in regular statistics). Here, we show no correlation between the precision of estimated numerosity and that of the estimated mean. We also found that people are very good at dividing attention between numerosity and the mean size of a single set (Experiment 1); however, they show some cost of dividing attention between two same-type (two numerosities or two mean sizes, Experiment 2) and two different-type (one numerosity and one mean size, Experiment 3) summaries when each summary is ascribed to a different set. These results support the idea of domain specificity of numerosity and mean size perception, which also implies that, unlike regular statistics, computing the mean does not require numerosity information. We also conclude that computational capacity of ensemble statistics is more limited by encoding several ensembles than computing several summaries. © 2017 Utochkin, Vostrikov.

Drawing on the wide range of classical and recent studies, the author shows the link between changes in economies of industrially developed countries and the development of the human capital theory revealed in the expanded list of indicators measuring human capital. The author proposes a periodization of the human capital theory suggesting five phases: (1) the pre-industrial phase (up to the seventeenth century); (2) the phase of mass education (the nineteenth through the first half of the twentieth century); (3) the late industrial period (1960s–1970s, the period when the core of the human capital theory was established); (4) the post-industrial period I (1980s–2000s); and (5) the post-industrial stage II or contemporary period (1980s–2000s). The study reassesses narrow interpretations, which still widely exist among applied economists. Based on the findings of the human development studies, the author argues for a broader list of indicators of human capital, and, specifically, considers human capital through the lens of national development; moreover, this coincides with the core of the given theory. It is shown that the traditional interpretation of human capital, known as years of schooling and training, does not represent the current situation in the economy, and can be extremely harmful to society if it is adopted as the basis of public policy oriented to the formation and growth of society. The present study can be useful to both economists and sociologists focusing on the indicators of human capital and its contribution to the socioeconomic development of a modern society. © 2017 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

However, despite multiple methods of assessment of survey tools and detection of measurement bias, there is still a lack of techniques of quantitative assessment of cognitive load on the interviewer and the respondent during the interview. In case of personal interview, both interviewer and respondent are required physical and, to a larger extent, cognitive efforts to produce the information needed. In case of interviewer-assisted questionnaire, it is the interviewer's responsibility to allocate limited individual resources related to attention, memory, visual and motor control, active listening and interpretation to minimize respondent's misunderstanding of the questions and the mistakes made by interviewer while recording the answers; thus, the interviewer is required to possess meta-cognitive and self-regulatory skills. The interviewer might experience cognitive overload when performing multiple tasks during the interview such as sustaining the contact with respondents, carrying out control over his/her own actions during the questionnaire completion and control over the work of office equipment while simultaneously recording possible violations detected during the interview; the cognitive overload may eventually lead to low-quality data. However, the sociologists' attention to the measurement of cognitive overload during the interview has been minimal so far. The article provides the results of an analytical review of traditional and new approaches to the measurement of cognitive load used in the areas of cognitive science, ergonomics, learning process studies and problem solving. The authors substantiate a possibility to employ them in quantitative evaluation and optimization of cognitive load experienced by interviewer (and further by respondent) and outline the immediate prospects of a research program aimed to design an integral methodological approach towards the use of multiple cognitive load indicators (based both on retrospective self-report and physiological and behavioral data) in various surveys.",Interview-induced cognitive load; Objective cognitive load measurement methods; Subjective cognitive load measurement methods; Survey data quality; Task-evoked pupillary response; The Paas Scale,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037033632

Meanwhile, extensive discussions about new forms of inequality and social participation were driven by changes in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. As a result, the topic of “precarity” has become more relevant in recent times. The reasons for this interest are the growing tensions in labor markets and problems of employment systems in various countries. The purpose of this article is to study the precarious opportunities for employees in the context of an analysis of their self-assessments of the risks of job losses and future labor incomes, as well as to compare this self-perception between those employed in Russia and Germany. The aim of the comparative analysis is the identification of social factors of the precarious employment in market economies, and to achieve an understanding of the degree of social inequality from the point of employment participation in Russia. The article starts with an examination of the theoretical foundations. These foundations are a modern interpretation of the sociological theory of the social structure of society, the development of resources, and actor theories. The model of the subjective perception of inequality A. Hense is under consideration. In the model, the conceptual provisions of methodological individualism of S. Lindenberg and P. Burdieu's methodological relativism are integrated. The data of the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey - Higher School of Economics (RLMS-HSE) and German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) were used for multivariate analysis. Determinants (production, legal, contextual) were studied using generalized ordered probit models with random effects. As a result, the authors conclude that the precariousness of employment and incomes in Russia captures a large proportion of wage earners and is fixed throughout the observation period. A higher level of education weakens anxiety, although in Russia it should be more significant than in Germany. Workers are a risk group in the self-perception of precarity, but the situation in Russia is changing if differentiated professional groups are evaluated. Working conditions depend on the system of social support for workers and on the social capital of workers (family support and the origin of the worker). The self-perception of precariousness among workers increases if the number of dependents is high. The size of the enterprise has a different impact on self-perception of the precariousness for workers in Russia and Germany. In Russia, women are most susceptible to the perception of precarity, whereas in Germany, such effects are not recorded. In general, the study shows that the reduction of inequality in the involvement of citizens in the labor market in the modern market economy is directly related to the proactive role of the state in the social protection of workers. © 2017 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

Materials: The data collected by the Study of Stress, Aging, and Health in Russia, the Study of Middle-Aged Danish Twins and the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins, and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing was utilized. Results: Among the male participants, the age-standardized grip strength was 2 kg and 1 kg lower in Russia than in Denmark and in England, respectively. The age-standardized grip strength among the female participants was 1.9 kg and 1.6 kg lower in Russia than in Denmark and in England, respectively. In Moscow, a one-kilogram increase in grip strength was associated with a 4% (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94, 0.99) reduction in mortality among men and a 10% (HR = 0.90, 95%CI: 0.86, 0.94) among women. Meanwhile, a one-kilogram increase in grip strength was associated with a 6% (HR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.93, 0.95) and an 8% (HR = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.90, 0.94) decrease in mortality among Danish men and women, respectively, and with a 2% (HR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.97, 0.99) and a 3% (HR = 0.97, 95%CI: 0.95, 0.98) reduction in mortality among the English men and women, respectively. Conclusion: The study suggests that, although absolute grip strength values appear to vary across the Muscovite, Danish, and English samples, the degree to which grip strength is predictive of mortality is comparable across national populations with diverse socioeconomic and health profiles and life expectancy levels. © 2017 Oksuzyan et al.

Here, we present methods and disease and risk estimates for COPD and asthma from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) 2015 study. The GBD study provides annual updates on estimates of deaths, prevalence, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), a summary measure of fatal and non-fatal disease outcomes, for over 300 diseases and injuries, for 188 countries from 1990 to the most recent year. Methods We estimated numbers of deaths due to COPD and asthma using the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble modelling (CODEm) tool. First, we analysed data from vital registration and verbal autopsy for the aggregate category of all chronic respiratory diseases. Subsequently, models were run for asthma and COPD relying on covariates to predict rates in countries that have incomplete or no vital registration data. Disease estimates for COPD and asthma were based on systematic reviews of published papers, unpublished reports, surveys, and health service encounter data from the USA. We used the Global Initiative of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease spirometry-based definition as the reference for COPD and a reported diagnosis of asthma with current wheeze as the definition of asthma. We used a Bayesian meta-regression tool, DisMod-MR 2.1, to derive estimates of prevalence and incidence. We estimated population-attributable fractions for risk factors for COPD and asthma from exposure data, relative risks, and a theoretical minimum exposure level. Results were stratified by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure of income per capita, mean years of education over the age of 15 years, and total fertility rate. Findings In 2015, 3·2 million people (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1 million to 3·3 million) died from COPD worldwide, an increase of 11·6% (95% UI 5·3 to 19·8) compared with 1990. There was a decrease in age-standardised death rate of 41·9% (37·7 to 45·1) but this was counteracted by population growth and ageing of the global population. From 1990 to 2015, the prevalence of COPD increased by 44·2% (41·7 to 46·6), whereas age-standardised prevalence decreased by 14·7% (13·5 to 15·9). In 2015, 0·40 million people (0·36 million to 0·44 million) died from asthma, a decrease of 26·7% (−7·2 to 43·7) from 1990, and the age-standardised death rate decreased by 58·8% (39·0 to 69·0). The prevalence of asthma increased by 12·6% (9·0 to 16·4), whereas the age-standardised prevalence decreased by 17·7% (15·1 to 19·9). Age-standardised DALY rates due to COPD increased until the middle range of the SDI before reducing sharply. Age-standardised DALY rates due to asthma in both sexes decreased monotonically with rising SDI. The relation between with SDI and DALY rates due to asthma was attributed to variation in years of life lost (YLLs), whereas DALY rates due to COPD varied similarly for YLLs and years lived with disability across the SDI continuum. Smoking and ambient particulate matter were the main risk factors for COPD followed by household air pollution, occupational particulates, ozone, and secondhand smoke. Together, these risks explained 73·3% (95% UI 65·8 to 80·1) of DALYs due to COPD. Smoking and occupational asthmagens were the only risks quantified for asthma in GBD, accounting for 16·5% (14·6 to 18·7) of DALYs due to asthma. Interpretation Asthma was the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease worldwide in 2015, with twice the number of cases of COPD. Deaths from COPD were eight times more common than deaths from asthma. In 2015, COPD caused 2·6% of global DALYs and asthma 1·1% of global DALYs. Although there are laudable international collaborative efforts to make surveys of asthma and COPD more comparable, no consensus exists on case definitions and how to measure disease severity for population health measurements like GBD. Comparisons between countries and over time are important, as much of the chronic respiratory burden is either preventable or treatable with affordable interventions.

Free bulging process is an experimental technique that can be used to characterize material in conditions of biaxial tension during superplastic, as well as conventional, hot forming. The constitutive constants are calculated on a base of the information about the bulge geometry, applied pressure, and forming time. A multi-dome forming test allows one to reduce the number of the experiments required for the characterization, since every multi-dome test produces several domes of different size. In this study, a specific die for multi-dome test was used. The die has six holes with different radiuses of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 mm. During a test, the specimen is clamped between blank holder and die holder, heated to a specific temperature, and formed by applying constant gas pressure. The experiments were conducted at different temperatures for OT4-1 titanium alloy. The constitutive constants were obtained by processing the experimental data using two different techniques and compared with tensile test results. In order to estimate the influence of friction on the experimental results and to verify obtained material characteristics, finite element (FE) simulation was performed. Finally, the results of FE simulation were compared with the experimental data. The results of the simulation show the advantage of material characterization based on multi dome tests and its interpretation by inverse analysis. The deviations produced by the effect of friction are more significant when the direct approach is applied instead of inverse analysis with a semi analytical model of the bulging process. © 2017 by the authors.

For instance, when studying divergence in life expectancy, this method allows researchers to more easily contrast age-specific mortality trends between populations by controlling for initial age-specific mortality differences. Two approaches are assessed: (1) an additive change method that uses logic similar to cause-of-death decomposition, and (2) a contour decomposition method that extends the stepwise replacement algorithm along an age-period demographic contour. The two approaches produce similar results, but the contour method is more widely applicable. We provide a full description of the contour replacement method and examples of its application to life expectancy and lifetime disparity differences between the United States and England and Wales in the period 1980–2010. © 2017, The Author(s).",Aggregate demographic measure; Decomposition; Demographic change; Mortality; Stepwise replacement,"England; human; life expectancy; mortality; statistical model; trends; United States; Wales; England; Humans; Life Expectancy; Models, Statistical; Mortality; United States; Wales",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026484616

To give such an interpretation in previous studies, certain restrictions were necessary. Our goal here is to consider a more general situation available through the worldline approximation to the dual AdS gravity. Namely, we are interested in computing the spherical conformal blocks without the previously imposed restrictions on the conformal dimensions of the internal channels. The duality is realised as an equality of the so-called heavy-light limit of the n-point conformal block and the action of n−2 particles propagating in some AdS-like background with either a conical singularity or a BTZ black hole. We describe a procedure that allows relaxing the constraint on the intermediate channels. To obtain an explicit expression for the conformal block on the CFT side, we use a recently proposed recursion procedure and find full agreement between the results of the boundary and bulk computations. © 2017, The Author(s).",AdS-CFT Correspondence; Conformal Field Theory,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028688938

Building on insights gleaned from balance theory in social network studies and from Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical physics, we propose a model to quantitatively capture the dynamics of the four types of triadic relationships in a network. Central to our model are the triads’ incidence rates and the idea that those can be modeled by assigning a specific triadic energy to each type of triadic relation. We emphasize the role of the degeneracy of the different triads and how it impacts the degree of frustration in the political network. In order to account for a persistent form of disorder in the formation of the triadic relationships, we introduce the systemic variable temperature. In order to learn about the dynamics and motives, we propose a generic Hamiltonian with three terms to model the triadic energies. One term is connected with a three-body interaction that captures balance theory. The other terms take into account the impact of heterogeneity and of negative edges in the triads. The validity of our model is tested on four datasets including the time series of triadic relationships for the standings between two classes of alliances in a massively multiplayer online game (MMOG). We also analyze real-world data for the relationships between the “agents” involved in the Syrian civil war, and in the relations between countries during the Cold War era. We find emerging properties in the triadic relationships in a political network, for example reflecting itself in a persistent hierarchy between the four triadic energies, and in the consistency of the extracted parameters from comparing the model Hamiltonian to the data. © 2017 Belaza et al.

In many cases, it is not clear if homophily is the result of a socialization process, where individuals change their traits according to the dominance of that trait in their local social networks, or if it results from a selection process, in which individuals reshape their social networks so that their traits match those in the new environment. Here we demonstrate the detailed temporal formation of strong homophily in academic achievements of high school and university students. We analyze a unique dataset that contains information about the detailed time evolution of a friendship network of 6,000 students across 42 months. Combining the evolving social network data with the time series of the academic performance (GPA) of individual students, we show that academic homophily is a result of selection: students prefer to gradually reorganize their social networks according to their performance levels, rather than adapting their performance to the level of their local group. We find no signs for a pull effect, where a social environment of good performers motivates bad students to improve their performance. We are able to understand the underlying dynamics of grades and networks with a simple model. The lack of a social pull effect in classical educational settings could have important implications for the understanding of the observed persistence of segregation, inequality and social immobility in societies. © 2017 Smirnov, Thurner.

Suppose that these theories are commonly known. Then, players will refine their first-order beliefs, and challenge their own theories, through strategic reasoning. I develop and characterize epistemically a new solution concept, Selective Rationalizability, which accomplishes this task under the following assumption: when the observed behavior is not compatible with the beliefs in players' rationality and theories of all orders, players keep the orders of belief in rationality that are per se compatible with the observed behavior, and drop the incompatible beliefs in the theories. Thus, Selective Rationalizability captures Common Strong Belief in Rationality (Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2002) and refines Extensive-Form Rationalizability (Pearce, 1984; BS, 2002), whereas Strong-δ-Rationalizability (Battigalli, 2003; Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2003) captures the opposite epistemic priority choice. Selective Rationalizability can be extended to encompass richer epistemic priority orderings among different theories of opponents' behavior. This allows to establish a surprising connection with strategic stability (Kohlberg and Mertens, 1986). © E.

The phylogeny of E. coli isolated from Crohn's disease patients (CDEC) was controversial, and while genotyping results suggested heterogeneity, the sequenced strains of E. coli from CD patients were closely related. Results: We performed the shotgun genome sequencing of 28 E. coli isolates from ten CD patients and compared genomes from these isolates with already published genomes of CD strains and other pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. CDEC was shown to belong to A, B1, B2 and D phylogenetic groups. The plasmid and several operons from the reference CD-associated E. coli strain LF82 were demonstrated to be more often present in CDEC genomes belonging to different phylogenetic groups than in genomes of commensal strains. The operons include carbon-source induced invasion GimA island, prophage I, iron uptake operons I and II, capsular assembly pathogenetic island IV and propanediol and galactitol utilization operons. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CDEC are phylogenetically diverse. However, some strains isolated from independent sources possess highly similar chromosome or plasmids. Though no CD-specific genes or functional domains were present in all CD-associated strains, some genes and operons are more often found in the genomes of CDEC than in commensal E. coli. They are principally linked to gut colonization and utilization of propanediol and other sugar alcohols. © 2017 The Author(s).",Crohn's disease; E. coli; Genome; Propanediol,"bacteriocin; antiinfective agent; adult; Article; bacterial genome; bacterial strain; bacteriophage; bacterium isolation; cecum; clinical article; controlled study; Crohn disease; enteropathogenic Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli; feces analysis; female; genetic variability; genome analysis; genotype; human; human tissue; ileum; intestine biopsy; male; middle aged; operon; phylogeny; plasmid; sequence analysis; shotgun genome sequencing; sigmoid; young adult; antibiotic resistance; biosynthesis; Crohn disease; drug effects; Escherichia coli; genetic variation; genetics; genomics; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteriocins; Crohn Disease; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Escherichia coli; Female; Genetic Variation; Genomics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phylogeny; Young Adult",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025102508

access and quality index based on mortality from causes amenable to personal health care in 195 countries and territories, 1990-2015: A novel analysis from the global burden of disease study

National levels of personal health-care access and quality can be approximated by measuring mortality rates from causes that should not be fatal in the presence of effective medical care (ie, amenable mortality). Previous analyses of mortality amenable to health care only focused on high-income countries and faced several methodological challenges. In the present analysis, we use the highly standardised cause of death and risk factor estimates generated through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to improve and expand the quantification of personal health-care access and quality for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. Methods We mapped the most widely used list of causes amenable to personal health care developed by Nolte and McKee to 32 GBD causes. We accounted for variations in cause of death certification and misclassifications through the extensive data standardisation processes and redistribution algorithms developed for GBD. To isolate the effects of personal health-care access and quality, we risk-standardised cause-specific mortality rates for each geography-year by removing the joint effects of local environmental and behavioural risks, and adding back the global levels of risk exposure as estimated for GBD 2015. We employed principal component analysis to create a single, interpretable summary measure-the Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index-on a scale of 0 to 100. The HAQ Index showed strong convergence validity as compared with other health-system indicators, including health expenditure per capita (r=0·88), an index of 11 universal health coverage interventions (r=0·83), and human resources for health per 1000 (r=0·77). We used free disposal hull analysis with bootstrapping to produce a frontier based on the relationship between the HAQ Index and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a measure of overall development consisting of income per capita, average years of education, and total fertility rates. This frontier allowed us to better quantify the maximum levels of personal health-care access and quality achieved across the development spectrum, and pinpoint geographies where gaps between observed and potential levels have narrowed or widened over time. Findings Between 1990 and 2015, nearly all countries and territories saw their HAQ Index values improve; nonetheless, the difference between the highest and lowest observed HAQ Index was larger in 2015 than in 1990, ranging from 28·6 to 94·6. Of 195 geographies, 167 had statistically significant increases in HAQ Index levels since 1990, with South Korea, Turkey, Peru, China, and the Maldives recording among the largest gains by 2015. Performance on the HAQ Index and individual causes showed distinct patterns by region and level of development, yet substantial heterogeneities emerged for several causes, including cancers in highest-SDI countries; chronic kidney disease, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections among middle-SDI countries; and measles and tetanus among lowest-SDI countries. While the global HAQ Index average rose from 40·7 (95% uncertainty interval, 39·0-42·8) in 1990 to 53·7 (52·2-55·4) in 2015, far less progress occurred in narrowing the gap between observed HAQ Index values and maximum levels achieved; at the global level, the difference between the observed and frontier HAQ Index only decreased from 21·2 in 1990 to 20·1 in 2015. If every country and territory had achieved the highest observed HAQ Index by their corresponding level of SDI, the global average would have been 73·8 in 2015. Several countries, particularly in eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa, reached HAQ Index values similar to or beyond their development levels, whereas others, namely in southern sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia, lagged behind what geographies of similar development attained between 1990 and 2015. Interpretation This novel extension of the GBD Study shows the untapped potential for personal health-care access and quality improvement across the development spectrum. Amid substantive advances in personal health care at the national level, heterogeneous patterns for individual causes in given countries or territories suggest that few places have consistently achieved optimal health-care access and quality across health-system functions and therapeutic areas. This is especially evident in middle-SDI countries, many of which have recently undergone or are currently experiencing epidemiological transitions. The HAQ Index, if paired with other measures of health-system characteristics such as intervention coverage, could provide a robust avenue for tracking progress on universal health coverage and identifying local priorities for strengthening personal health-care quality and access throughout the world.

Terminal erythroid differentiation results in dramatic upregulation of alpha-globin genes making their expression comparable to the rRNA transcriptional output. Little is known about the influence of the erythroid-specific alpha-globin gene transcription outburst on adjacent, widely expressed genes and large-scale chromatin organization. Here, we have analyzed the total transcription output, the overall chromatin contact profile, and CTCF binding within the 2.7 Mb segment of chicken chromosome 14 harboring the alpha-globin gene cluster in cultured lymphoid cells and cultured erythroid cells before and after induction of terminal erythroid differentiation. Results: We found that, similarly to mammalian genome, the chicken genomes is organized in TADs and compartments. Full activation of the alpha-globin gene transcription in differentiated erythroid cells is correlated with upregulation of several adjacent housekeeping genes and the emergence of abundant intergenic transcription. An extended chromosome region encompassing the alpha-globin cluster becomes significantly decompacted in differentiated erythroid cells, and depleted in CTCF binding and CTCF-anchored chromatin loops, while the sub-TAD harboring alpha-globin gene cluster and the upstream major regulatory element (MRE) becomes highly enriched with chromatin interactions as compared to lymphoid and proliferating erythroid cells. The alpha-globin gene domain and the neighboring loci reside within the A-like chromatin compartment in both lymphoid and erythroid cells and become further segregated from the upstream gene desert upon terminal erythroid differentiation. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the effects of tissue-specific transcription activation are not restricted to the host genomic locus but affect the overall chromatin structure and transcriptional output of the encompassing topologically associating domain. © 2017 The Author(s).",Alpha-globin genes; Chromatin compartment; Chromatin spatial structure; CTCF; TAD; Transcription,"coproporphyrinogen oxidase; hemoglobin alpha chain; kruppel like factor; RNA; transcription factor CTCF; transcription factor GATA 2; transcription factor Nrf1; transcription factor TAL1; transferrin receptor; avian protein; hemoglobin alpha chain; protein binding; transcription factor CTCF; alpha globin gene; animal cell; Article; cell differentiation; chicken; chromatin structure; chromosome 14; controlled study; erythrocyte culture; gene; gene activation; gene cluster; gene expression regulation; gene location; gene structure; genetic correlation; globin gene; intracellular space; lymphocyte culture; MPG gene; MRPL28 gene; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; RHBDF1 gene; RNA sequence; TMEM8A gene; topologically associating domain; transcription regulation; upregulation; animal; cell line; chromatin; cytology; erythroid cell; erythropoiesis; essential gene; genetics; metabolism; transcription initiation; alpha-Globins; Animals; Avian Proteins; CCCTC-Binding Factor; Cell Line; Chickens; Chromatin; Erythroid Cells; Erythropoiesis; Genes, Essential; Protein Binding; Transcriptional Activation; Up-Regulation",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021890474

Objectives The GBD (Global Burden of Disease) 2015 study integrated data on disease incidence, prevalence, and mortality to produce consistent, up-to-date estimates for cardiovascular burden. Methods CVD mortality was estimated from vital registration and verbal autopsy data. CVD prevalence was estimated using modeling software and data from health surveys, prospective cohorts, health system administrative data, and registries. Years lived with disability (YLD) were estimated by multiplying prevalence by disability weights. Years of life lost (YLL) were estimated by multiplying age-specific CVD deaths by a reference life expectancy. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Results In 2015, there were an estimated 422.7 million cases of CVD (95% uncertainty interval: 415.53 to 427.87 million cases) and 17.92 million CVD deaths (95% uncertainty interval: 17.59 to 18.28 million CVD deaths). Declines in the age-standardized CVD death rate occurred between 1990 and 2015 in all high-income and some middle-income countries. Ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of CVD health lost globally, as well as in each world region, followed by stroke. As SDI increased beyond 0.25, the highest CVD mortality shifted from women to men. CVD mortality decreased sharply for both sexes in countries with an SDI >0.75. Conclusions CVDs remain a major cause of health loss for all regions of the world. Sociodemographic change over the past 25 years has been associated with dramatic declines in CVD in regions with very high SDI, but only a gradual decrease or no change in most regions. Future updates of the GBD study can be used to guide policymakers who are focused on reducing the overall burden of noncommunicable disease and achieving specific global health targets for CVD. © 2017 The Authors",cause of death; epidemiology; global health,age; Article; autopsy; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cerebrovascular accident; demography; disability-adjusted life year; educational status; fertility; global disease burden; health status indicator; health survey; high income country; household income; human; incidence; ischemic heart disease; life expectancy; middle income country; national disease burden; prevalence; priority journal; regional disease burden; registration; sex difference; social class; adult; aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; cause of death; clinical trial; female; global health; male; middle aged; morbidity; multicenter study; procedures; prospective study; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; sex ratio; survival rate; trends; young adult; Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; Female; Global Health; Humans; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Survival Rate; Young Adult,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019362730

One of the most important instruments for that improvement should be the consideration of foreign investor's opinions and ideas and reaction to the most urgent and critical issues which serve as obstacles to their investment activities in Russia. This paper considers the case of Japanese investors in Russia. It is based on the results of a survey of Japanese companies doing business in Russia (members of the Japanese Business Club Moscow) and content analysis of a set of interviews with the representatives of the Japanese business and academic community and also of non-governmental organizations. We identify which factors attract Japanese capital to Russia and which hinder investment activities. Studying Japanese investment in Russia reveals the particular challenges and obstacles that make Japanese companies reluctant to engage in business activities in Russia. The research reveals and systemizes the factors restricting the development of investment cooperation and their roots, and identifies possible ways of overcoming these challenges. The analysis shows that the constraining factors can be divided into 3 groups by the origin: external – associated with the problems of the investment climate in Russia, internal – associated with specific features of the Japanese production and management system, and other factors – non-economic factors which mainly concern business culture and informational issues. © 2017",business climate; business culture; foreign investment; Japan; Japanese management; Russia,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018254081

The author analyzes the growth and changes in civic identity compared to ethnic and regional identity. The paper highlights that tendency towards parity between these identities which replaced ethnic identity dominance is prevalent. The paper also investigates public representations of civic identity and concludes that the unifying role of state is the strongest representation. There are indications that the Russian civic identity can be referred to as national and civic identity. The author assumes that one of the reasons behind inadequate understanding of civic identity is insufficient scientific study of the issue and poor public dissemination (in media and education spheres).

Aims We assess simultaneously individual- and area-level factors associated with an elevated risk of alcohol-related mortality among Lithuanian males aged 30–64. Methods Our analysis is based on a census-linked dataset containing information on individual- and area-level characteristics and death events which occurred between March 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2013. We limit the analysis to a few causes of death which are directly linked to excessive alcohol consumption: accidental poisonings by alcohol (X45) and liver cirrhosis (K70 and K74). Multilevel Poisson regression models with random intercepts are applied to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRR). Results The selected individual-level characteristics are important predictors of alcohol-related mortality, whereas area-level variables show much less pronounced or insignificant effects. Compared to married men, never married (MRR = 1.9, CI:1.6–2.2), divorced (MRR = 2.6, CI:2.3–2.9), and widowed (MRR = 2.4, CI: 1.8–3.1) men are disadvantaged groups. Men who have the lowest level of educational attainment have the highest mortality risk (MRR = 1.7 CI:1.4–2.1). Being unemployed is associated with a five-fold risk of alcohol-related death (MRR = 5.1, CI: 4.4–5.9), even after adjusting for all other individual variables. Lithuanian males have an advantage over Russian (MRR = 1.3, CI:1.1–1.6) and Polish (MRR = 1.8, CI: 1.5–2.2) males. After adjusting for all individual characteristics, only two out of seven area-level variables—i.e., the share of ethnic minorities in the population and the election turnout—have statistically significant direct associations. These variables contribute to a higher risk of alcohol-related mortality at the individual level. Conclusions The huge and increasing socio-economic disparities in alcohol-related mortality indicate that recently implemented anti-alcohol measures in Lithuania should be reinforced by specific measures targeting the most disadvantaged population groups and geographical areas. © 2017 Grigoriev et al.

Our central hypothesis is that these job-seeking strategies vary depending on qualification level and professional achievement. Empirical data for the study was collected in Saint Petersburg in schools with varying levels of achievement and prestige. We conducted interviews with teachers (N=49) on their professional biography. For analysis we used two points in an individual teacher's career: the choice of the first school in the teacher's career path and decision-making when switching schools. The results of the study show that several models of job seeking coexist on the teaching job market. We distinguish two narrative perspectives that a teacher may take when telling of her employment. Within an outsider's perspective schools are regarded as organizations that may be potential employers. One model is similar to the market of other qualified jobs, where professionals compete for more or less prestigious positions. The other model, which is more similar to the unqualified job market, is based on the tacit assumption that all schools are equal and places more importance on the workplace's geographical proximity. Within an insider's perspective teachers regard their potential employing schools primarily as professional communities they may wish to join. There are several types of social bonds that may be used by a person seeking employment as a school teacher. These includes seeking a job in a school one has graduated from ('inbreeding') and seeking a job in a school where one's children study. Both strategies may lead to the social background of school's teachers being reproduced. We argue that the job seeking strategies of teachers based on social ties can be understood as a mechanism that supports the movement of qualified teachers to disadvantaged schools. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.",Educational inequality; Labour market; Professional group; School; Teachers,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021806511

One consequence of this crisis that is revealed here is a two-fold extension of the poor, which was due to a deterioration of conditions for those on the periphery of poverty (people who typically escape poverty only to return to it from time to time due to troubled economic conditions) and the sharp impoverishment of Russians outside the immediate periphery of poverty. Given that the impact of the crisis on them was the most severe, the focus of the article is on those who were most dramatically impoverished during the crisis. It is shown that the dramatically impoverished differ from the typical representatives of the poor in several economic and socio-demographic characteristics. Representatives of this group suffer high risks on the labour market; they are seen to be lower quality human capital and have unstable and informal employment, a lack of social security. They often have dependents with poor health, as well as nonworking people at working age, including those who lost their jobs in 2015. On the basis of these group characteristics it is shown that precarization processes have most seriously affected this part of the population. In this regard, the article demonstrates the importance of social policy as a tool for preventing the impoverishment of those in the wide peripheral zone of the poor, and offers a number of recommendations to address this problem. These include increasing unemployment benefits, matching the cost of living to a minimum wage, expanding social guarantees such as employment contracts in line with the most recently devised protection measures and returning to the practice of excluding the subsistence level of the child's total income from the wages of parents when determining the appropriate amount of tax payments. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.",Crisis; Poverty; Precarious work; Sharp impoverishment,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021787939

The study is based on the data from international large-scale assessments of adult competences (PIAAC), which provides us with the results of competency tests on literacy and numeracy of adults in Russia and the OECD countries. These assessment results are representative for the able-bodied population in each country at the national level. While test scores in the OECD countries show a linear correlation with the formal education levels, in Russia we observe distinctive tendencies. The analysis of the PIAAC data reveals three different inconsistencies. First, there is no linear correlation found between the assessment results and formal qualification in Russia. The increase of competence slows down or stops at the level of higher education, while at lower qualification levels there is no substantial difference between Russia and the OECD countries. The second important finding is that a significant proportion of people with low competences have high-skill jobs in Russia. At the same time, the distribution of people with certain formal qualifications on the labor market is quite similar in Russia and the OECD countries. This inconsistency was hidden for a long time due to low reliability of the most common indicator for both sociological and economic studies in Russia - the level of formal qualification. The third empirical finding demonstrates that both formal qualification and measured competences are significant in one's employment prospects. However, the difference in incomes between people with low and high competences is noticeably smaller in Russia than the OECD countries. There may be different explanations for this finding. Either employers are not interested in highly competent workers or there is a certain difference between what appear to be the same job positions in Russia and other countries. The interpretation of quantitative results in this article is also supported by interviews from a qualitative project focusing on the life trajectories. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.",Competence-based approach; Education; Inconsistency in education; Literacy; Social inequality,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021836662

Previous research has demonstrated aberrant LRTC in depressed patients; however, it is unknown whether the neuronal dynamics normalize after psychological treatment. In this study, we recorded EEG during eyes-closed rest in depressed patients (N = 71) and healthy controls (N = 25), and investigated the temporal dynamics in depressed patients at baseline, and after attending either a brief mindfulness training or a stress reduction training. Compared to the healthy controls, depressed patients showed stronger LRTC in theta oscillations (4–7 Hz) at baseline. Following the psychological interventions both groups of patients demonstrated reduced LRTC in the theta band. The reduction of theta LRTC differed marginally between the groups, and explorative analyses of separate groups revealed noteworthy topographic differences. A positive relationship between the changes in LRTC, and changes in depressive symptoms was observed in the mindfulness group. In summary, our data show that aberrant temporal dynamics of ongoing oscillations in depressive patients are attenuated after treatment, and thus may help uncover the mechanisms with which psychotherapeutic interventions affect the brain. © 2017 Gärtner, Irrmischer, Winnebeck, Fissler, Huntenburg, Schroeter, Bajbouj, Linkenkaer-Hansen, Nikulin and Barnhofer.",Depression; EEG; Long-range temporal correlations; Mindfulness; Stress-reduction; Theta,adult; Article; controlled study; correlation analysis; depression; electroencephalogram; electroencephalograph; female; human; long range temporal correlation; major clinical study; male; mental patient; mindfulness; psychiatric treatment; relaxation training; stress management; theta rhythm,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021623498

However, quantifying the information between a stimulus and a spike train has proven to be challenging. We propose a new (in vitro) method to measure how much information a single neuron transfers from the input it receives to its output spike train. The input is generated by an artificial neural network that responds to a randomly appearing and disappearing “sensory stimulus”: the hidden state. The sum of this network activity is injected as current input into the neuron under investigation. The mutual information between the hidden state on the one hand and spike trains of the artificial network or the recorded spike train on the other hand can easily be estimated due to the binary shape of the hidden state. The characteristics of the input current, such as the time constant as a result of the (dis)appearance rate of the hidden state or the amplitude of the input current (the firing frequency of the neurons in the artificial network), can independently be varied. As an example, we apply this method to pyramidal neurons in the CA1 of mouse hippocampi and compare the recorded spike trains to the optimal response of the “Bayesian neuron” (BN). We conclude that like in the BN, information transfer in hippocampal pyramidal cells is non-linear and amplifying: the information loss between the artificial input and the output spike train is high if the input to the neuron (the firing of the artificial network) is not very informative about the hidden state. If the input to the neuron does contain a lot of information about the hidden state, the information loss is low. Moreover, neurons increase their firing rates in case the (dis)appearance rate is high, so that the (relative) amount of transferred information stays constant. © 2017 Zeldenrust, de Knecht, Wadman, Denève and Gutkin.",Artificial neural network; Bayesian neuron model; In vitro electrophysiology; Information theory; Neural information processing,Brain; Computation theory; Electrophysiology; Information theory; Neurons; Artificial networks; Computational properties; Hippocampal pyramidal cells; In-vitro; Information transfers; Mutual informations; Neural information processing; Neuron model; Neural networks; artificial neural network; firing rate; heart; hippocampus; in vitro study; information science; pyramidal nerve cell; spike; stimulus; time series analysis,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027573042

Three self-paced reading experiments were conducted: one in German, comparing gender-unmarked reflexives and gender-marked pronouns, and two in Russian, comparing gender-marked and -unmarked reflexives. In the German experiment, no interference effects were found. In the first experiment in Russian, an unexpected reading times pattern emerged: in the condition where the distractor matched the gender of the reflexive's antecedent, reading of the gender-unmarked, but not the gender-marked reflexives was slowed down. The same reading times pattern was replicated in a second experiment in Russian where the order of the reflexive and the main verb was inverted. We conclude that the results of the two experiments in Russian are inconsistent with the retrieval interference account, but can be explained by encoding interference and additional semantic processing efforts associated with the processing of gender-marked reflexives. In sum, we found no evidence that would allow us to reject the syntax as an early filer account (Nicol and Swinney, 1989). © 2017 Laurinavichyute, Jäger, Akinina, Roß and Dragoy.",Anaphor; Comprehension; Encoding interference; German; Reflexive processing; Retrieval interference; Russian,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020408190

The vorticity is assumed to be an arbitrary function of Lagrangian coordinates and quadratic in the small parameter proportional to the wave steepness. The vorticity effects manifest themselves in a shift of the wave number in the carrier wave and in variation in the coefficient multiplying the nonlinear term. In the case of vorticity dependence on the vertical Lagrangian coordinate only (Gouyon waves), the shift of the wave number and the respective coefficient are constant. When the vorticity is dependent on both Lagrangian coordinates, the shift of the wave number is horizontally inhomogeneous. There are special cases (e.g., Gerstner waves) in which the vorticity is proportional to the squared wave amplitude and nonlinearity disappears, thus making the equations for wave packet dynamics linear. It is shown that the NLS solution for weakly rotational waves in the Eulerian variables may be obtained from the Lagrangian solution by simply changing the horizontal coordinates. © Author(s) 2017.",,deep water; equation; Eulerian analysis; vorticity; wave propagation,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020486118

Lexical and conceptual activation is measured by semantic priming. In contrast, word selection is indexed by semantic interference and is hampered in semantically homogeneous (HOM) contexts. We examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of these complementary processes in a picture naming task with blocks of semantically heterogeneous (HET) or HOM stimuli. We used electrocorticography data obtained from frontal and temporal cortices, permitting detailed spatiotemporal analysis of word retrieval processes. A semantic interference effect was observed with naming latencies longer in HOM versus HET blocks. Cortical response strength as indexed by high-frequency band (HFB) activity (70-150 Hz) amplitude revealed effects linked to lexical-semantic activation and word selection observed in widespread regions of the cortical mantle. Depending on the subsecond timing and cortical region, HFB indexed semantic interference (i.e., more activity in HOM than HET blocks) or semantic priming effects (i.e., more activity in HET than HOM blocks). These effects overlapped in time and space in the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus and the left prefrontal cortex.

This exploratory study examines how HIV-prevention measures are perceived and experienced by PWID in the northwestern region of Russia. Methods: Purposive sampling was used to obtain a variety of cases that could reflect possible differences in perception and experience of HIV-prevention efforts. We conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with PWID residing in the Arkhangelsk and St. Petersburg regions. Results: The main sources of prevention information on HIV for PWID were media campaigns directed to the general population. These campaigns were effective with regard to communicating general knowledge on HIV but were ineffective in terms of risk behavior change. The subjects generally had trust in medical professionals and their advice but did not follow prevention recommendations. Most informants had no or very little prior contact with harm reduction services. On the level of attitudes towards HIV prevention efforts, we discovered three types of fatalism among PWID: ""personal fatalism"" - uselessness of HIV prevention efforts, if one uses drugs; ""prevention-related fatalism"" - prevention programs are low effective, because people do not pay attention to them before they get infected; ""state-related fatalism"" - the lack of belief that the state is concerned with HIV prevention issues. Despite this fatalism the participants opined that NGOs would do a better job than the state as they are ""really working"" with risk groups. Conclusions: As HIV prevention campaigns targeted at the general population and prevention advice received from medical professionals are not sufficiently effective for PWID in terms of risk behavior change, prevention programs, such as community-based and peer-based interventions specifically tailored to the needs of PWID are needed, which can be achieved by a large expansion of harm reduction services in the region. Personal communication should be a crucial element in such interventions in addition to harm reduction materials provision. Training programs, peer outreach, and culture-change interventions which try to alter widespread fatalistic norms or attitudes towards their health are especially needed, since this study indicates that fatalism is a major barrier for behavior change. © 2017 The Author(s).",HIV prevention; People who inject drugs (PWID); Qualitative research; Russia,"adult; Article; attitude to health; behavior change; clinical article; fatality; female; harm reduction; health education; high risk behavior; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection prevention; information dissemination; interpersonal communication; male; mass medium; miscellaneous named groups; people who inject drug; personal experience; Russian Federation; trust; attitude to health; complication; drug use; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; psychology; Russian Federation; substance abuse; transmission; young adult; Adult; Drug Users; Female; Harm Reduction; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Risk-Taking; Russia; Substance Abuse, Intravenous; Young Adult",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020184359

Crucially, they also need to compete for the interpretation of those signals with other neurons representing similar features. The form that this competition should take depends critically on the noise corrupting these signals. In this study we show that for the type of noise commonly observed in sensory systems, whose variance scales with the mean signal, sensory neurons should selectively divide their input signals by their predictions, suppressing ambiguous cues while amplifying others. Any change in the stimulus context alters which inputs are suppressed, leading to a deep dynamic reshaping of neural receptive fields going far beyond simple surround suppression. Paradoxically, these highly variable receptive fields go alongside and are in fact required for an invariant representation of external sensory features. In addition to offering a normative account of context-dependent changes in sensory responses, perceptual inference in the presence of signal-dependent noise accounts for ubiquitous features of sensory neurons such as divisive normalization, gain control and contrast dependent temporal dynamics. © 2017 Chalk et al.",,"noise; prediction; receptive field; sensory nerve cell; stimulus; animal; association; biological model; computer simulation; human; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; retina ganglion cell; signal noise ratio; statistical model; vision; visual field; Animals; Computer Simulation; Cues; Humans; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; Nerve Net; Neuronal Plasticity; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Visual Fields; Visual Perception",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021768441

There, the role of JT effect, although widely recognized, is still elusive. Here we show that these materials have vibronic excitations, related to local deformations rotating around JT ions in the dynamic limit, arising from linear electron-vibrational coupling in the ""Mexican hat"" potential profile. Their energy depends on total angular momentum, which is quantized, as in quantum rotors. We found them in the representative JT compound of orthorhombic manganites, LaMnO3. Since the ""Mexican hat"" potential energy surface is double-valued, they show up near the ground and excited states of JT ions. Recently, by using spectroscopic ellipsometry technique, we showed that they appear in the excited state in the form of sidebands, accompanying the electron transition between the JT split orbitals at neighboring Mn3+ ions.

A choice between two similarly valued alternatives creates psychological tension (cognitive dissonance) that is reduced by a postdecisional reevaluation of the alternatives. We measured EEG of human subjects during rest and free-choice paradigm. Our study demonstrates that choices associated with stronger cognitive dissonance trigger a larger negative frontocentral evoked response similar to error-related negativity, which has in turn been implicated in general performance monitoring. Furthermore, the amplitude of the evoked response is correlated with the reevaluation of the alternatives. We also found a link between individual neural dynamics (long-range temporal correlations) of the frontocentral cortices during rest and follow-up neural and behavioral effects of cognitive dissonance. Individuals with stronger restingstate long-range temporal correlations demonstrated a greater postdecisional reevaluation of the alternatives and larger evoked brain responses associated with stronger cognitive dissonance. Thus, our results suggest that cognitive dissonance is reflected in both restingstate and choice-related activity of the prefrontal cortex as part of the general performance-monitoring circuitry. © 2017 Colosio et al.",Cognitive dissonance; Error-related negativity; Long-range temporal correlation; Resting state; Spread of alternatives,adult; Article; behavior; cognition; controlled study; decision making; electroencephalography; Eriksen Flanker task; evoked response; experimental test; female; human; human experiment; Likert scale; male; mental disease; muscle contraction; nerve cell network; normal human; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; task performance; brain mapping; conflict; electroencephalography; physiology; procedures; young adult; Brain Mapping; Choice Behavior; Cognitive Dissonance; Conflict (Psychology); Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Nerve Net; Prefrontal Cortex; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019878189

tobacco control, especially after the adoption of the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, is a major public health success story. Nonetheless, smoking remains a leading risk for early death and disability worldwide, and therefore continues to require sustained political commitment. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) offers a robust platform through which global, regional, and national progress toward achieving smoking-related targets can be assessed. Methods We synthesised 2818 data sources with spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression and produced estimates of daily smoking prevalence by sex, age group, and year for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We analysed 38 risk-outcome pairs to generate estimates of smoking-attributable mortality and disease burden, as measured by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We then performed a cohort analysis of smoking prevalence by birth-year cohort to better understand temporal age patterns in smoking. We also did a decomposition analysis, in which we parsed out changes in all-cause smoking-attributable DALYs due to changes in population growth, population ageing, smoking prevalence, and risk-deleted DALY rates. Finally, we explored results by level of development using the Socio-demographic Index (SDI). Findings Worldwide, the age-standardised prevalence of daily smoking was 25·0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 24·2-25·7) for men and 5·4% (5·1-5·7) for women, representing 28·4% (25·8-31·1) and 34·4% (29·4-38·6) reductions, respectively, since 1990. A greater percentage of countries and territories achieved significant annualised rates of decline in smoking prevalence from 1990 to 2005 than in between 2005 and 2015; however, only four countries had significant annualised increases in smoking prevalence between 2005 and 2015 (Congo [Brazzaville] and Azerbaijan for men and Kuwait and Timor-Leste for women). In 2015, 11·5% of global deaths (6·4 million [95% UI 5·7-7·0 million]) were attributable to smoking worldwide, of which 52·2% took place in four countries (China, India, the USA, and Russia). Smoking was ranked among the five leading risk factors by DALYs in 109 countries and territories in 2015, rising from 88 geographies in 1990. In terms of birth cohorts, male smoking prevalence followed similar age patterns across levels of SDI, whereas much more heterogeneity was found in age patterns for female smokers by level of development. While smoking prevalence and risk-deleted DALY rates mostly decreased by sex and SDI quintile, population growth, population ageing, or a combination of both, drove rises in overall smoking attributable DALYs in low-SDI to middle-SDI geographies between 2005 and 2015. Interpretation The pace of progress in reducing smoking prevalence has been heterogeneous across geographies, development status, and sex, and as highlighted by more recent trends, maintaining past rates of decline should not be taken for granted, especially in women and in low-SDI to middle-SDI countries. Beyond the effect of the tobacco industry and societal mores, a crucial challenge facing tobacco control initiatives is that demographic forces are poised to heighten smoking's global toll, unless progress in preventing initiation and promoting cessation can be substantially accelerated. Greater success in tobacco control is possible but requires effective, comprehensive, and adequately implemented and enforced policies, which might in turn require global and national levels of political commitment beyond what has been achieved during the past 25 years. © 2017 The Author(s).

Depending upon the nature of the behavioral tasks, these mechanisms may predispose to different kinds of errors, with either increased or decreased response time (RT) of erroneous responses relative to correct responses. Specifically, slow responses are related to attentional lapses and decision uncertainty, these conditions tending to delay RTs of both erroneous and correct responses. Here we studied if RT may be a valid approximation distinguishing trials with high and low levels of sustained attention and decision uncertainty. We analyzed response-related and feedback-related modulations in theta, alpha and beta band activity in the auditory version of the two-choice condensation task, which is highly demanding for sustained attention while involves no inhibition of prepotent responses. Depending upon response speed and accuracy, trials were divided into slow correct, slow erroneous, fast correct and fast erroneous. We found that error-related frontal midline theta (FMT) was present only on fast erroneous trials. The feedback-related FMT was equally strong on slow erroneous and fast erroneous trials. Late post-response posterior alpha suppression was stronger on erroneous slow trials. Feedback-related frontal beta was present only on slow correct trials. The data obtained cumulatively suggests that RT allows distinguishing the two types of trials, with fast trials related to higher levels of attention and low uncertainty, and slow trials related to lower levels of attention and higher uncertainty. © 2017 Novikov, Nurislamova, Zhozhikashvili, Kalenkovich, Lapina and Chernyshev.",Alpha oscillations; Attention; Beta oscillations; Cognitive control; Error detection; Response time; Theta oscillations,attention; electroencephalogram; executive function; modulation; oscillation; response time; uncertainty; velocity,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018892439

Studies show that public opinion regarding these events is shaped by the way these stories are covered in various types of media such as television news, print media and online publications. The study examines how these tragedies were presented in the Russian media. The murder of the ambassador in Turkey was the most popular topic in the media, and all types of media delivered similar views. The poisoning tragedy was covered very differently in different types of media, from criticism over authorities to attempts to ""deproblematize"" the situation. The Berlin terrorist attack attracted least attention of the media and, unlike the assassination of the ambassador in Turkey, had lots of interpretations. The news analysis across three types of media shows that the number of publications, the amount of airtime devoted to these topics and the image formed by the media is closely connected to social and political factors (such as the link between the event and other agendas, the media's characteristics and role in the construction of an event's image, and authorities' official standpoint) rather than objective circumstances of the tragedy (casualties, remoteness et cet.).",Agenda-setting; Alcohol; Construction of problems; Internet; Mass media; Press; Public opinion; Terrorism,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028050534

We use a model of multilateral bargaining to demonstrate that this intuition may be flawed. Increasing the number of veto players or raising the supermajority requirement for redistribution may reduce protection on the equilibrium path. The reason is the existence of two distinct mechanisms of property protection. One is formal constraints that allow individuals or groups to block any redistribution that is not in their favor. The other occurs in equilibrium where players without such powers protect each other from redistribution. Players without formal veto power anticipate that the expropriation of other similar players will ultimately hurt them and thus combine their influence to prevent redistributions. In a stable allocation, the society exhibits a “class” structure with class members having equal wealth and strategically protecting each other from redistribution. © 2017 The Econometric Society",institutions; legislative bargaining; Political economy; property rights,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020271290

The optical lattice potential manifests itself in an interplay between an increase in the density of states on the Fermi surface and the modification of the fermion-fermion interaction (scattering) amplitude. The density of states is enhanced due to an increase of the effective mass of atoms. In deep lattices the scattering amplitude is strongly reduced compared to free space due to a small overlap of wave functions of fermions sitting in the neighboring lattice sites, which suppresses the p-wave superfluidity. However, for moderate lattice depths the enhancement of the density of states can compensate the decrease of the scattering amplitude. Moreover, the lattice setup significantly reduces inelastic collisional losses, which allows one to get closer to a p-wave Feshbach resonance. This opens possibilities to obtain the topological px+ipy superfluid phase, especially in the recently proposed subwavelength lattices. We demonstrate this for the two-dimensional version of the Kronig-Penney model allowing a transparent physical analysis. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,Atoms; Crystal lattices; Optical materials; Seismic waves; Wave functions; Density of state; Kronig-Penney models; Optical-lattice potential; P-wave Feshbach resonance; Physical analysis; Scattering amplitudes; Superfluid phase; Two-dimensional optical lattices; Optical lattices,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017631394

It argues that Sochi has been an important experimental space for the federal state in its reconstitution and re-territorialisation of the institutions of economic development. The Sochi project signposts a dual process: the return of regional policy to the state’s priorities and a (selective) return of the federal state to urban development. Whilst not without controversies and inconsistencies, this practice signifies a re-establishment of strategies seeking a more polycentric economic development, including through supporting places on Russia’s less developed peripheries.

This study describes Ukrainian educational inequalities in self-rated health and assesses how far psychosocial, material and behavioural factors account for the education gradient in health. Methods: Data were analyzed from the 2007 wave of the Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey. Education was categorized as: lower secondary or less, upper secondary and tertiary. In logistic regressions of 5451 complete cases, stratified by gender, declaring less than average health was regressed on education, before and after adjusting for psychosocial, material and behavioural factors. Results: In analyses adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, compared with those educated up to lower secondary level, tertiary education was associated with lower risk of less than average health for both men and women. Including material factors (income quintiles, housing assets, labour market status) reduced the association between education and health by 55-64% in men and 35-47% in women. Inclusion of health behaviours (physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption and body mass index) reduced the associations by 27-30% in men and 19-27% in women; in most cases including psychosocial factors (marital status, living alone, trust in family and friends) did not reduce the size of the associations. Including all potential explanatory factors reduced the associations by 68-84% in men and 43-60% in women. Conclusions: The education gradient in self-rated health in Ukraine was partly accounted for by material and behavioural factors. In addition to health behaviours, policymakers should consider upstream determinants of health inequalities, such as joblessness and poverty. © 2016 The Author.",,adolescent; adult; aged; educational status; employment; family; female; friend; health behavior; health disparity; health survey; housing; human; income; longitudinal study; male; marriage; middle aged; poverty; psychology; self report; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; Ukraine; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Educational Status; Employment; Family; Female; Friends; Health Behavior; Health Status Disparities; Health Surveys; Housing; Humans; Income; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Marital Status; Middle Aged; Poverty; Self Report; Socioeconomic Factors; Ukraine; Young Adult,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017212651

Initially it was studied in the equilibrium configurations with the straight magnetic field lines and the Alfvén speed only varying in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. Later the analysis of the Alfvén wave phase mixing was extended in various directions. In particular it was studied in two-dimensional planar magnetic plasma equilibria. Analytical investigation was carried out under the assumption that the wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic scale of the background quantity variation. This assumption enabled using the Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin (WKB) method. When it is not satisfied the study was only carried out numerically. In general, even the wave propagation in a one-dimensional inhomogeneous equilibrium can be only studied numerically. However there is one important exception, so-called non-reflective equilibria. In these equilibria the wave equation with the variable phase speed reduces to the Klein-Gordon equation with constant coefficients. In this paper we apply the theory of non-reflective wave propagation to studying the Alfvén wave phase mixing in two-dimensional planar magnetic plasma equilibria. Using curvilinear coordinates we reduce the equation describing the Alfvén wave phase mixing to the equation that becomes a one-dimensional wave equation in the absence of dissipation. This equation is further reduced to the equation which is the one-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation in the absence of dissipation. Then we show that this equation has constant coefficients when a particular relation between the plasma density and magnetic field magnitude is satisfied. Using the derived Klein-Gordon-type equation we study the phase mixing in various non-reflective equilibria. We emphasise that our analysis is valid even when the wavelength is comparable with the characteristic scale of the background quantity variation. In particular, we study the Alfvén wave damping due to phase mixing in an equilibrium with constant plasma density and exponentially divergent magnetic field lines. We confirm the result previously obtained in the WKB approximation that there is enhanced Alfvén wave damping in this equilibrium with the damping length proportional to ln(Re), where Re is the Reynolds number. Our theoretical results are applied to heating of coronal plumes. We show that, in spite of enhanced damping, Alfvén waves with periods of the order of one minute can be efficiently damped in the lower corona, at the height about 200 Mm, only if the shear viscosity is increased by about 6 orders of magnitude in comparison with its value given by the classical plasma theory. We believe that such increase of the shear viscosity can be provided by the turbulence. © ESO, 2017.",Hydrodynamics; Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); Plasmas; Sun: corona; Sun: oscillations; Waves,Approximation theory; Damping; Electromagnetic wave propagation in plasma; Equations of motion; Hydrodynamics; Instrument scales; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Magnetohydrodynamics; Mixing; Phase equilibria; Plasma (human); Plasma density; Plasma magnetohydrodynamic waves; Plasma theory; Reynolds number; Shear flow; Shear viscosity; Wave equations; Wave propagation; Waves; Analytical investigations; Curvilinear coordinate; Equilibrium configuration; Magnetic field magnitudes; One-dimensional wave equations; Solar coronal heating; Sun : corona; Sun: oscillations; Magnetoplasma,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017553261

Bitopic proteins, a broad subclass of membrane proteins, form dimers containing two membrane-spanning helices. Some aspects of their structure-function relationship cannot be fully understood without considering the protein-lipid interaction, which can determine the protein conformational ensemble. Experimental and computer modeling data concerning transmembrane parts of bitopic proteins are reviewed in the present paper. They highlight the importance of lipid-protein interactions and resolve certain paradoxes in the behavior of such proteins. Besides, some properties of membrane organization provided a clue to understanding of allosteric interactions between distant parts of proteins.

Exploratory analyses using retrospective cohort data on mortality from Ontario, Canada",2017,PLoS ONE,3.0,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85017544376&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0175837&partnerID=40&md5=3d16624aea9034d64f9b2e917955b7bc,"Objectives We aimed to explore whether mortality data are consistent with the view that aging is accelerated for people with a history of incarceration compared to the general population, using data on mortality rates and life expectancy for persons in Ontario, Canada. Methods We obtained data from the Ontario Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services on all adults admitted to provincial correctional facilities in Ontario in 2000, and linked these data with death records from provincial vital statistics between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2012. We used life table methods to calculate mortality rates and life expectancies for this cohort by sex and 5-year age group. We similarly generated population comparison rates using publicly available data for the general population of Ontario in 2006 as the midpoint of the follow up period. We compared these mortality indices between the 2000 Ontario prison cohort and the general population by age group and sex. Results The difference in all-cause mortality rates between the 2000 Ontario prison cohort and the general population was greatest for younger adults, with the prison cohort experiencing rates of death that would be expected for persons at least 15 years older at ages 20 to 44 for men and ages 20 to 59 for women. Life expectancy in the 2000 Ontario prison cohort was most similar to life expectancy of persons five years older in the general population at age intervals 20 to 45 in men and 20 to 30 in women. Conclusions For most of adulthood, life expectancy and mortality rates are worse for adults with a history of incarceration than for the general population in Ontario, Canada. However, the association between mortality and incarceration status is modified by age, with the greatest relative burden of mortality experienced by younger persons with a history of incarceration and modified by sex, with worse relative mortality in women. Future research should explore the association between incarceration status and markers of aging including mortality, morbidity and physical appearance. © 2017 Kouyoumdjian et al.

The evolutionarily conserved innate immune system is considered to play a key role in tissue injury recognition and the subsequent development of sterile inflammation; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet completely understood. Here, we show that cholesterol sulfate, a molecule present in relatively high concentrations in the epithelial layer of barrier tissues, is selectively recognized by Mincle (Clec4e), a C-type lectin receptor of the innate immune system that is strongly up-regulated in response to skin damage. Mincle activation by cholesterol sulfate causes the secretion of a range of proinflammatory mediators, and s.c. injection of cholesterol sulfate results in a Mincle-mediated induction of a severe local inflammatory response. In addition, our study reveals a role of Mincle as a driving component in the pathogenesis of allergic skin inflammation. In a well-established model of allergic contact dermatitis, the absence of Mincle leads to a significant suppression of the magnitude of the skin inflammatory response as assessed by changes in ear thickness, myeloid cell infiltration, and cytokine and chemokine secretion.

Because the pathological alterations are predominantly probed using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), many questions about the electrophysiological bases of resting-state alterations in psychiatric disorders, particularly among mood disorder patients, remain unanswered. Alongside important research using electroencephalography (EEG), the specific recent contributions and future promise of magnetoencephalography (MEG) in this field are not fully recognized and valued. Here, we provide a critical review of recent findings from MEG resting-state connectivity within major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). The clinical MEG resting-state results are compared with those previously reported with fMRI and EEG. Taken together, MEG appears to be a promising but still critically underexploited technique to unravel the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate abnormal (both hyper- and hypo-) connectivity patterns involved in MDD and BD. In particular, a major strength of MEG is its ability to provide source-space estimations of neuromagnetic long-range rhythmic synchronization at various frequencies (i.e., oscillatory coupling). The reviewed literature highlights the relevance of probing local and interregional rhythmic synchronization to explore the pathophysiological underpinnings of each disorder. However, before we can fully take advantage of MEG connectivity analyses in psychiatry, several limitations inherent to MEG connectivity analyses need to be understood and taken into account. Thus, we also discuss current methodological challenges and outline paths for future research. MEG resting-state studies provide an important window onto perturbed spontaneous oscillatory brain networks and hence supply an important complement to fMRI-based resting-state measurements in psychiatric populations. © 2017 Alamian, Hincapié, Combrisson, Thiery, Martel, Althukov and Jerbi.",Bipolar disorder; Connectivity; Depression; Magnetoencephalography; Mental illness; Oscillations; Psychiatry; Resting-state,bipolar disorder; brain function; clinical effectiveness; connectome; cortical synchronization; electroencephalogram; functional assessment; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; image analysis; magnetoencephalography; major depression; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; resting state network; Review,English,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016165948

The third part of the review is devoted to a detailed examination of three factors in conflict formation at a theoretical level. The first of these is financial management and the opposition of independent strategies and pooling mechanisms. Continuing the theme of financial control, the next factor relates to concepts of power and how the grounds for its construction within a household contribute to financial conflict. The final factor is the gendered division of labor, which, according to a number of studies, is a key factor in marital dissatisfaction (especially for women) and the consequent emergence of conflict.

Such changes align with the predictions of classical sociologists like Weber and Simmel that the phenomenon of rationalization would extend to all spheres of society, including everyday life. Based on qualitative research data on drinking water consumption in Moscow, this study assesses how such trends are manifested in contemporary Russian society. The study demonstrates an increasing emphasis on managing thirst. In certain social contexts (including sports, weight loss, and pregnancy), the habitualization of socially constructed norms of water consumption has transformed these into an internal need. The mechanisms of control and calculative behavior are manifested in both the conscious attempts and unconscious measuring tactics developed by Muscovites to increase the volume of water being drunk. Ordinary people who are anxious about the safety of drinking water seek institutional support from the state, advertisements for bottled water, and expert knowledge of various kinds. Because the quality of drinking water is perceived to be an existential issue, the lack of certainty around this issue sometimes gives rise to irrational beliefs. The researchers were especially surprised to find references to ""life-giving"" or ""dead"" water in the narratives of respondents with a university education, including some with medical degrees.",Calculation; Disciplinary control; Everyday life; Habitualization; Healthism; Institutional regulation; Medicalization; Rationalization; Water quality,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018321801

This information on the material behavior is used in the design of gas forming processes for the production of parts for aerospace industry. In computer simulations of the regimes for such technologies one should adequately describe the material properties. A disadvantage of the classical experimental method of tensile testing of plate specimens is that the information taken from these tests is related to metal forming in the conditions of uniaxial tension that is not typical for gas forming processes. Experimental method of forming circular membranes considered here allows one to study the behavior of a material in the conditions of biaxial tension. Interpretation of the results is proposed to carry out by an inverse analysis utilizing a special semianalytical model for the solution of the direct task. The key point of this semianalytical model is a dependence of the blank thickness at the dome pole on the dome height, which accounts for the strain rate sensitivity coefficient. This approach was applied for the processing of experimental results obtained by free forming of industrial aluminum alloys. Material characteristics obtained were compared to charecteristics determined by other methods for the same set of experimental data available in the literature. To estimate the efficiency of the method proposed, the characteristics obtained were verified by finite element simulations the results which were in good agreement with experimental data. © 2017, Institute for Metals Superplasticity Problems of Russian Academy of Sciences.

In the article there is a suggested methodical approach that allows calculating the safety stock quantity at the dependent demand in view of supply chains reliability requirements; the variants for different inventory management strategies at the dependent demand are examined; optimal strategy choice algorithm and results of total costs calculation in view of the reliability are given. © 2017 Transport and Telecommunication Institute 2017.",dependent demand; inventory management; perfect order; supply chains reliability,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014586341

Formal excess of work hours is not perceived in fact as overtime by the workers; the author finds out that what is important for the workers is the balance between their professional and personal life as well as the degree of fatigue. The author concludes that workers' age, sex, family status and how they prioritize work in the list of life priorities shape the way how they delimit work and overtime.

The paper is based on the results of the survey titled «Individual, Family, and Society» conducted by the Institute for Social Analysis and Prediction (RANEPA) in 2015. The study investigates respondents' answers about their and their spouses' housework burden as well as levels of their satisfaction with the housework distribution and emotional attitude towards it. The authors reveal that, unlike women, men tend to give higher estimates to the time spent by them and their spouses on household chores. The gap between average male and female estimates decreases with the length of relationship and increases with the birth of children. The data of the survey suggest that social norms and values have a considerable impact on respondents' answers. In the last section of the paper, the authors provide an analysis of the interviews' recordings (respondents' intonations, comments, or laugh during their answers). The authors discover that, similar situations may result in different quantitative estimates depending on the respondents' satisfaction level and attitudes. Extremely high or extremely low estimates of time spent on housework often result from dissatisfaction with the distribution of housework. © 2017 «Russian Public Opinion Research Center» (OAO «VCIOM»).",Audio records; Housework distribution; Social norms; Telephone survey; Time budget,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044118366

The authors explain that, according to the employment situation, the 2014-2016 crisis was a budget crisis and consumption crisis rather than an economic crisis. Basic labor rights have become less respected throughout the country, the average length of the workweek has increased, and even nominal hourly labor cost has decreased. The situation of the most vulnerable social and economic groups - those em-ployed in the private sector, especially in commerce and public services as well as people living in small cities and rural area - has particularly deteriorated. Significant changes were observed in the Moscow labor market where the increasing workload was accompanied by the reduction of gap between the Moscow labor cost and the labor cost in other regions. By the 2016 autumn, the number of workers whose rights were not fully observed made up half of the employed population; the risk of job loss is high in this particular group. All the trends mentioned above are reflected in the Russian mass consciousness where a controversy between the employers and the employees plays an increasingly im-portant role. © 2017 «Russian Public Opinion Research Center» (OAO «VCIOM»).",Consequences of the crisis; Employment; Exploitation; Labor market; Remuneration; Shady employment; Workers' rights; Workload,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044111914

The genomic analysis revealed mechanisms allowing this anaerobic bacterium to ferment peptides or to implement nitrate reduction with acetate or molecular hydrogen as electron donors. The genome encoded five different [NiFe]- and [FeFe]-hydrogenases, one of which, group 1 [NiFe]-hydrogenase, is presumably involved in lithoheterotrophic growth, three other produce H2 during fermentation, and one is apparently bidirectional. The ability to reduce nitrate is determined by a nitrate reductase of the Nap family, while nitrite reduction to ammonia is presumably catalyzed by an octaheme cytochrome c nitrite reductase eHao. The genome contained genes of respiratory polysulfide/thiosulfate reductase, however, elemental sulfur and thiosulfate were not used as the electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration with acetate or H2, probably due to the lack of the gene of the maturation protein. Nevertheless, elemental sulfur and thiosulfate stimulated growth on fermentable substrates (peptides), being reduced to sulfide, most probably through the action of the cytoplasmic sulfide dehydrogenase and/or NAD(P)-dependent [NiFe]-hydrogenase (sulfhydrogenase) encoded by the genome. Surprisingly, the genome of this anaerobic microorganism encoded all genes for cytochrome c oxidase, however, its maturation machinery seems to be non-operational due to genomic rearrangements of supplementary genes. Despite the fact that sugars were not among the substrates reported when C. abyssi was first described, our genomic analysis revealed multiple genes of glycoside hydrolases, and some of them were predicted to be secreted. This finding aided in bringing out four carbohydrates that supported the growth of C. abyssi: starch, cellobiose, glucomannan and xyloglucan. The genomic analysis demonstrated the ability of C. abyssi to synthesize nucleotides and most amino acids and vitamins. Finally, the genomic sequence allowed us to perform a phylogenomic analysis, based on 38 protein sequences, which confirmed the deep branching of this lineage and justified the proposal of a novel phylum Calditrichaeota. © 2017 Kublanov, Sigalova, Gavrilov, Lebedinsky, Rinke, Kovaleva, Chernyh, Ivanova, Daum, Reddy, Klenk, Spring, Göker, Reva, Miroshnichenko, Kyrpides, Woyke, Gelfand, Bonch-Osmolovskaya.",Bacterial evolution; Caldithrix; Genomic analysis; Phylogenomics; Phylum; Sequencing; Taxonomy,ABC transporter; carbohydrate; cytochrome c oxidase; DNA binding protein; nitrate reductase; amino acid sequence; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterial growth; Caldithrix abyssi; DNA binding; DNA library; electron transport; fatty acid synthesis; fermentation; gene cluster; gene rearrangement; gene sequence; genome analysis; genomic island; molecular genetics; nonhuman; nucleotide metabolism; oxidative phosphorylation; oxygen consumption; phylogenetic tree; polymerase chain reaction; protein assembly; protein processing; regulatory sequence; sequence alignment; sequence analysis; thermophilic bacterium,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014463798

When two eye’s images only differ in luminance, observers may perceive shininess, a form of rivalry called binocular luster. Does dichoptic information guide attention in visual search? Wolfe and Franzel (Perception & Psychophysics, 44(1), 81–93, 1988) reported that rivalry could guide attention only weakly, but that luster (shininess) “popped out,” producing very shallow Reaction Time (RT) × Set Size functions. In this study, we have revisited the topic with new and improved stimuli. By using a checkerboard pattern in rivalry experiments, we found that search for rivalry can be more efficient (16 ms/item) than standard, rivalrous grating (30 ms/item). The checkerboard may reduce distracting orientation signals that masked the salience of rivalry between simple orthogonal gratings. Lustrous stimuli did not pop out when potential contrast and luminance artifacts were reduced. However, search efficiency was substantially improved when luster was added to the search target. Both rivalry and luster tasks can produce search asymmetries, as is characteristic of guiding features in search. These results suggest that interocular differences that produce rivalry or luster can guide attention, but these effects are relatively weak and can be hidden by other features like luminance and orientation in visual search tasks. © 2016, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.",Binocular luster; Binocular rivalry; Visual attention; Visual search,adolescent; adult; attention; depth perception; female; human; male; photostimulation; physiology; psychomotor performance; vision; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Female; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Vision Disparity; Visual Perception; Young Adult,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85000501203

In this case CAs have to depend on pattern of chromosomal contacts and on chromosome spatial organization in a cell nucleus. We were interested in whether variation of nucleus 3D organization results in difference of radiation induced CA formation frequency. Experimental data available do not provide information sufficient for definite conclusions. To have more deep insight in this issue we developed the biophysical modeling technique taking into account different levels of chromosome/nuclear organization and radiation damage of DNA and chromosomes. Computer experiments on gamma irradiation were carried out for two types of cells with different 3D organization of nuclei, preferentially peripheral and internal. CA frequencies were found to depend on spatial positioning of chromosomes within a nucleus which determines a pattern of interchromosomal contacts. For individual chromosomes this effect can be more pronounced than for genome averaged. Since significant part of aberrations, for example dicentrics, results in cell death, the proposed technique is capable of evaluating radiosensitivity of cells, both normal and cancer, with the incorporation of 3D genome information.

The ESR spectra at T>TN, in the disordered Luttinger-spin-liquid phase, reveal nearly ideal Heisenberg-chain behavior with only a very small, field-independent linewidth, ∼1/T. In the ordered state, below TN, we identify field-dependent antiferromagnetic resonance modes, which are well described by pseudo-Goldstone magnons in the model of a collinear biaxial antiferromagnet. Additionally, we observe a major resonant mode with unusual and strongly anisotropic properties, which is not anticipated by the conventional theory of Goldstone spin waves. We propose that this unexpected magnetic excitation can be attributed to a field-independent magnon mode renormalized due to its interaction with the high-energy amplitude (Higgs) mode in the regime of weak spontaneous symmetry breaking. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010402315

Quantifying the levels of SBP is important to guide prevention policies and interventions. OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between SBP of at least 110 to 115mmHg and SBP of 140mmHg or higher and the burden of different causes of death and disability by age and sex for 195 countries and territories, 1990-2015. DESIGN A comparative risk assessment of health loss related to SBP. Estimated distribution of SBP was based on 844 studies from 154 countries (published 1980-2015) of 8.69 million participants. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression was used to generate estimates of mean SBP and adjusted variance for each age, sex, country, and year. Diseases with sufficient evidence for a causal relationship with high SBP (eg, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke) were included in the primary analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean SBP level, cause-specific deaths, and health burden related to SBP (≤110-115mmHg and also≤140mmHg) by age, sex, country, and year. RESULTS Between 1990-2015, the rate of SBP of at least 110 to 115mmHg increased from 73 119 (95%uncertainty interval [UI], 67 949-78 241) to 81 373 (95%UI, 76 814-85 770) per 100000, and SBP of 140mmHg or higher increased from 17 307 (95%UI, 17 117-17 492) to 20526 (95%UI, 20283-20746) per 100000. The estimated annual death rate per 100000associated with SBP of at least 110 to 115mmHg increased from 135.6 (95%UI, 122.4-148.1) to 145.2 (95%UI 130.3-159.9) and the rate for SBP of 140mmHg or higher increased from 97.9 (95%UI, 87.5-108.1) to 106.3 (95%UI, 94.6-118.1). Loss of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with SBP of at least 110 to 115mmHg increased from 148 million (95%UI, 134-162 million) to 211 million (95% UI, 193-231 million), and for SBP of 140mmHg or higher, the loss increased from 95.9 million (95%UI, 87.0-104.9 million) to 143.0million (95%UI, 130.2-157.0million). The largest numbers of SBP-related deathswere caused by ischemic heart disease (4.9 million [95%UI, 4.0-5.7 million]; 54.5%), hemorrhagic stroke (2.0million [95%UI, 1.6-2.3 million]; 58.3%), and ischemic stroke (1.5 million [95%UI, 1.2-1.8 million]; 50.0%). In 2015, China, India, Russia, Indonesia, and the United States accounted for more than half of the globalDALYs related to SBP of at least 110 to 115mmHg. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In international surveys, although there is uncertainty in some estimates, the rate of elevated SBP (≤110-115 and≤140mmHg) increased substantially between 1990 and 2015, and DALYs and deaths associated with elevated SBP also increased. Projections based on this sample suggest that in 2015, an estimated 3.5 billion adults had SBP of at least 110 to 115mmHg and 874 million adults had SBP of 140mmHg or higher. © 2017 American Medical Association.",,"adult; age; aged; Article; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cause of death; China; comparative study; controlled study; disability; disease association; epidemiological data; female; gender; global disease burden; human; hypertension; India; Indonesia; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; risk assessment; Russian Federation; systolic blood pressure; uncertainty; United States; age distribution; blood pressure; complication; health; health survey; hypertension; Intracranial Hemorrhages; middle aged; Monte Carlo method; mortality; Myocardial Ischemia; normal distribution; prevalence; quality adjusted life year; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; sex ratio; statistics and numerical data; Stroke; systole; very elderly; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Pressure; Cause of Death; Female; Global Health; Health Surveys; Humans; Hypertension; Intracranial Hemorrhages; Male; Middle Aged; Monte Carlo Method; Myocardial Ischemia; Normal Distribution; Prevalence; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Assessment; Sex Distribution; Stroke; Systole; Uncertainty",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010540246

These are long-standing questions that have proven difficult to answer. To test between competing hypotheses, we constructed a massive repository of historical and archaeological information known as “Seshat: Global History Databank.” We systematically coded data on 414 societies from 30 regions around the world spanning the last 10,000 years. We were able to capture information on 51 variables reflecting nine characteristics of human societies, such as social scale, economy, features of governance, and information systems. Our analyses revealed that these different characteristics show strong relationships with each other and that a single principal component captures around three-quarters of the observed variation. Furthermore, we found that different characteristics of social complexity are highly predictable across different world regions. These results suggest that key aspects of social organization are functionally related and do indeed coevolve in predictable ways.

The Hamiltonian under study describes two bands: electron and hole ones. Both bands have spherical Fermi surfaces, whose radii are slightly mismatched due to doping. These types of models are often used in the analysis of magnetic states in chromium and its alloys, superconducting iron pnictides, AA-type bilayer graphene, borides, etc. At zero magnetic field, the uniform ground state of the system turns out to be unstable against electronic phase separation. The applied magnetic field affects the phase diagram in several ways. In particular, the Zeeman term stabilizes new antiferromagnetic phases. It also significantly shifts the boundaries of inhomogeneous (phase-separated) states.

One specific question we address in this paper is what makes cross-representational interplay possible? We offer two distinct theoretical scenarios: according to the first scenario, co-activated knowledge representations interact with the help of an interface established between them via congruent activation in a mediating third-party general cognitive mechanism, e.g., attention. According to the second scenario, co-activated knowledge representations interact due to an overlap between their features, for example when they share a magnitude component. First, we make a case for cross-representational interplay based on grounded and situated theories of cognition. Second, we discuss interface-based interactions between distinct (i.e., non-overlapping) knowledge representations. Third, we discuss how co-activated representations may share their architecture via partial overlap. Finally, we outline constraints regarding the flexibility of these proposed mechanisms. © 2017 Myachykov, Chapman and Fischer.",Cross-representational interaction; Embodiment; Grounded cognition; Representation; Simulation,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011966283

Theoretical modeling, hermeneutics, qualitative and quantitative methods have been applied. The solution for identifying prerequisites of self-development and social positioning of a person that are rooted in dialogical I—Other relationships has been suggested. The originality of the paper is associated with describing the relation to the other as a reflexive I—Other relationship; with an elaborated model that highlights the variety of dimensions of I—Other relationships (between I and Other, I-in-Other, Other-in-Me, I-in-Myself) results in a truly dialogical mode of being; with revealing the potentials of a Conversation Partner in dialogical I—Other relationships (subjective interrelations and significance of Conversation Partners, their activity, fullness of the reflection of significant Conversation Partners); with a description of different hypostases of Conversation Partners (Real, Ideal, Secret, I as Myself) by the means of hermeneutics. The method called “My Conversation Partner” should also be mentioned, as well as the empirical study of existential and social resources of Conversation Partners.

There are only a few monographs on the subject, and even fewer case studies which analyze the architecture of individual buildings in their political context. This article is dedicated to the mosques of Abd al-Qadir in Constantine, Algeria (1972-1994, Ismail Hussein Mohammed) and Hassan II in Casablanca, Morocco (1987-1993, Michel Pinseau) and presents the results of onsite research in 2014-2016. The first of the above-mentioned mosques has not been studied before, and therefore much more attention is paid to it. The author argues that both mosques combine traditional decoration with contemporary spatial solutions, for example the bold diagonal setting of the Casablanca's minaret. The decoration of this mosque is focused solely on national heritage, but at the same time it is supplemented with modern details and materials. All this should emphasize both the traditionalism and the modernity of Hasan II's monarchy, as well as include Casablanca in the orbit of the traditional Islam controlled by the king. The creators of the mosque in Constantine оpenly abandoned modernization attempts and emphasized the exact reproduction of the iconic forms of the architecture of Maghreb and al-Andalus. These forms should underline the status of the first Islamic university in socialist Algeria of the 1970s as the new cultural center of the entire Western Islamic world. © 2017 Saint Petersburg State University.

The growing fragmentation of production processes across countries carries important consequences for the world trade and creates new opportunities for the global growth. Under the new conditions of global value chains acceleration, the trade liberalization and the business investment openness in countries are important conditions for sustainable economic growth and protectionism costs have become much more significant than usually perceived. The traditional instruments of trade policy in the form of tariffs do not apply to the quantitative analysis of services trade, taking into account the specific characteristics of services tradability. Trade in services tends to be restricted mainly through market access barriers and through treatment of foreign providers that is less favorable than that of national ones. The article reviews the evolution of analysis methods for barriers to trade in services and classifies the approaches to quantify the restrictions in services trade. There is also a review of the measures in services trade based on notifications of countries measures under the World Trade Organization. Current trends in international trade are associated with a slowdown of the material production and the concurrent development and growth of the international trade in services. The international trade in services has become over the last decades not only one of the most dynamic sectors of the world economy, but also an important component of national economies, and requires an adequate level of state regulation. The development of the service sector requires a comprehensive assessment of trade barriers and regulatory measures. The provisions of the General Agreement on Trade in Services are far behind the practice of measures affecting international trade in services. © 2017 Academic Educational Forum on International Relations.

However, existing data is more likely to testify that VWM can store no more than two such compressed units. But the nature of this discrepancy can be methodological: VWM for ensembles was never tested using methods that are applied in the research of VWM for objects. Here we have tested the capacity and precision of VWM for objects and ensembles using two standard methods - change detection and continuous report with a mixture model. We found that VWM for both types of units showed the similar capacity and precision when critical psychophysical parameters, such as foveal density and area are controlled. We also showed that this quantitative similarity between objects and ensembles is provided by a mechanism that represents each ensemble as a holistic VWM chunk as efficiently as it represents any single object. © 2017 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

It is the result of interdisciplinary synthesis of an array of the emerged in the XXth century reflexional sciences: logics, semiotics, psychology, conflictology, ethics, management, politology, systems science, cybernetics, physics, mathematics, cosmology. The Russian-American scientist V.A. Lefebvre contributed to each of them. V.A. Lefebvre has the Renaissant range of research interests, phenomenal creativity, encyclopeadism of professional activity. The research objective of this article is the analysis of V.A. Lefebvre's trajectory of life and his creative achievements in the field of interdisciplinary studies of such complex psychological reality as reflexivity. For the first time the personological periodization of V.A. Lefebvre's life was suggested, the development of his personality in three key periods of his work (Soviet, American, Transatlantic) was characterized, the analysis of his scientific achievements was conducted. The constructivity of V.A. Lefebvre's systematic interdisciplinary approach to the study and learning of reflexive processes in the context of the modern development of science and society is shown. The novelty of the results from the study of V.A. Lefebvre's creative life is determined by the systematic methodology of his reflexive-scientific studies according to the complementarity principle. This principle is realized by means of interaction of personological approach to characteristics of V.A. Lefebvre's creative personality and scientific approach to the analysis of his innovative scientific work in the contemporary sociocultural context of development of science and society. In the end, the fundamental significance of V.A. Lefebvre's interdisciplinary works for the study of reflexion on a scale of science of man and cosmology is shown. © 2017 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

The process of development has embraced not only science and technology, but also social and cultural aspects of life. The contemporary image of Russia is in many ways defined by its younger generation that grew up with new economic, social and political standards. Young people's values, attitudes and aspirations differ from those of the adult generation of Russians, since the last years have been marked by transformations inside the country, as well as by some global changes. This paper demonstrates the results of a study which aimed to identify the relationship between individual values and attitude towards innovation. 380 respondents, young and adult representatives of the Russian population, took part in the research. The respondents belonged to the younger generation (under 25 years old) or to the ault generation (over 45 years old). The principal instrument used was the method of questionnaires. The methodical inventory consisted of three main blocks oriented to the study of the following constructs: the PVQ-R Method of Measuring individual Values (Schwartz et al., 2012) and the method of Self-Assessment of Innovative Qualities of a Personality (Lebedeva & Tatarko, 2009).The goal of the research was to reveal the age differences in values and attitudes towards innovation, and to find which values determine positive or negative attitude towards innovations among representatives of different generations of Russians. The younger generation values of Individually Directed Thought, Stimulation, Achievement, Power/Dominance stimulate the adoption of innovations. © 2017 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

But the rate of this growth in Russia is lower than in other countries with similar elements of academic system. The notable position among the Russian publications of the recent years hold the publications of the scientists of the laboratories, created under the program of ""megagrants"" (almost each fifth article in 2015). The natural- scientific part of the Russian psychology and the related fields are better represented in the leading international psychological journals than the social and applied parts. In the recent years there is also a noted growth of the amount of publications in this thematic area. Many authors, who have the biggest amount of publications in the leading international psychological journals, are foreigners or have a second place of employment in a foreign organization. Very little amount of authors systematically publish articles in the leading journals from year to year.

Four stages of preparation by the People’s Republic of China for accession to the WTO within which there was a transformation of the legal system of China from 1982 to 2001 are described. The sources of Chinese lawmaking are presented and systematized as the basis of the economic legislation of the PRC at the stage of preparation for inclusion of China in the WTO. Attention is drawn to the particularities of the power organization of the Chinese state, in which there is no separation of powers into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. This, in turn, allows to mark the feature in the economic sphere of legal regulation in China connected with the existence of the rules established by the Supreme National Court as a source of law. To represent the dynamics of normativelegal regulation of foreign trade activities, China has used the system of dialectical and universal methods of knowledge; general scientific methods (induction and deduction) and techniques (analysis and synthesis); as well as a special method – formally-legal. The identified course and direction of changes in legal support of domestic and foreign economic processes in China suggests the possibility to consider the experience of China in the promotion of Russia in the international trading community. The authors propose that the entry of China into the WTO is of interest to the BRICS countries as long as China achieves optimal utilization of the WTO’s external economic opportunities.

Kindergarten staff underwent little change for decades. Sociological surveys revealed the first shifts in the motivation of preschool teachers after some large-scale salary increase measures in education were undertaken. According to the Monitoring of Education Markets and Organizations, only 60% of preschool teachers wanted to continue working for their institutions in 2007-2011, while 40% felt like changing their jobs. In 2016, 78% of kindergarten teachers did not want to quit: they had new incentives and an interest in professional growth, their work had become more creative, and interest in work had come to the fore. The findings give reason for considering further support of the salary reform feasible in order to change the nature of preschool teaching as a strategic vector of development in this education sector. As the course of the preschool teacher salary reform has been analyzed and the major trends in changes in institutions that applied performance-based contracting in 2012-2016 have been identified, the conclusion is made that further implementation of performance-based contracts is possible provided that performance criteria recommended ""from above"" are specified wisely at the level of individual educational institutions and adjusted to kindergarten-specific development strategies.

This will be able to identify best practices, innovative techniques and mechanisms for working with different population segments for their further replication in order to improve the population's health not only in the northern territories, but also in other subjects of the RF. Material and methods. The empirical basis for a comparative analysis was the 2015 annual public health and health care reports of six regional health authorities in the Russian North: The Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), the Arkhangelsk Region, the Republic of Komi, the Krasnoyarsk Territory, and the Murmansk Region, as well as the websites of the Ministries of Health of these six subjects of the RF. Conclusion. The authors have identified main promising areas to improve regional and local programs and initiatives aimed at promoting HLS and preventing early CNCDs in the rural and remote areas of the Russian North. These are, above all, to strengthen the role of leading governmental health institutions in the regions, which coordinate work on preventive activities and on the formation of health-saving behavior; to set up, on their initiative, coordinating councils for interdepartmental and intradepartmental interaction; to attract broad population masses to actively participate in the events on world and national health and disease control days; and to use current and interactive technologies to work with young people. © 2017 Media Sphera Publishing Group.

As a result of this—by the time the war started—a whole generation acquired an understanding of what they were fighting for, who the enemy was and what was at stake. Using materials from the “Pioneer” magazine from 1932–1941, one can see how publications aimed at children were educating their readers, forming their consciousness, and preparing the youth to fight a war with the capitalist states. Magazines published for Soviet pioneers in the 1930s have not yet been researched to a satisfactory degree. Researchers usually focus their attention on the continuity vis-a-vis previous traditions and practices, pointing to trends that were common for pre-revolutionary and post-revolutionary publications.

The model constitutes substantial and operational basis to create new reflexive techniques which can take the form of an interview, questionnaire, self-cognition method etc. The novelty of the author’s approach is in the discovery and detailed justification of the connection between productivity and dialogicality of the relationship I and the Other, which is not sufficiently studied in classical psychological and philosophical texts, modern studies, applied works from such points of view as genesis, multiple approaches, constructive effects.",Creativity; Culture; Dialog; Hermeneutics; Model; Other; Other; Productivity; Reflection; Relation; Self,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041079768

But the question of understanding this construct is troublesome. There are three theoretical approaches to understanding group entitativity (essence-based entitativity, agency-based entitativity and unity-based entitativity) and at least two different empirical strategies for measuring the entitativity (operationalization in one of the theoretical approaches and entitativity as a set of characteristics from different approaches that work as a common scale). This paper aims to answer the question whether there are any differences in the various understanding of entitativity. In our studies entitativity is described as involving three components: “essence” (the group members’ similarity), “agency” (the goals and the interaction between group members) and “unity” (the cohesion of a group and the degree of the group importance). In Study 1 a series of confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the three-component model of entitativity fitted the data well for different groups (ingroup, outgroup, intimacy groups and social categories) and demonstrated a better fit compared to the alternative model (entitativity as a common construct). The results of the study suggest that the components of entitativity are interrelated, but not identical to each other. Study 2 demonstrated that the use of different ways of understanding entitativity (such as “essence”, “agency”, and “unity” components or the common entitativity scale) doesn’t lead to differences related to blatant prejudice, subtle prejudice, and identification. Our results demonstrate that there are no substantial differences between the measurements of entitativity.

Their authors had a generally positive assessment of Stalin’s role, not only as the head of the Soviet state, but also as the “moderator” of the literary process in the Soviet Union. Stalin’s personal evaluation of concrete writers and their literary efforts—as well as, to some degree, the attitudes of these authors towards this Father of Nations—became an important factor in their inclusion into the classroom canon of textbooks or, on the contrary, discredited and excluded them from it. The authors of these books carefully selected and reinterpreted the facts to emphasize Stalin’s exceptional importance for the development of 20th century Russian literature. Thus, Stalin appeared as the most important figure of the literary process of the Soviet period, and the single method of Soviet literature which was being approved during his reign—“socialist realism”—as a natural extension and embodiment of humanistic traditions of Russian literary classics. In Soviet school textbooks, there is an attempt to create a concept of the history of the 20th century Russian literature on the ideological basis of the late Soviet “soil-bound” conservatism, and to conceptualize Stalinism as the natural continuation of pre-revolutionary political-ideological conservatism. Thus, the school subject “literature” is used as an ideological tool to indoctrinate the younger generation with a “national-patriotic” spirit. Moreover, this ideological line persisted in textbooks throughout the 1990s and 2000s with almost no adjustment, while their distribution was preferentially maintained by government agencies.",Late Soviet conservatism; Literature textbooks; Scholastic literature canon; Soviet literature; Stalin,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041050457

These parameters are an important resource for coping behaviour in youth. The results of the correlation analysis showed that a positive image of the home environment is correlated with efficient strategies of self-control, seeking social support, planned problem solving, and positive reappraisal, and also with an inefficient strategy of confrontive coping. The study’s results can be used in psychological counseling to form individual profiles of the home environment preferences.

Although they are united by the important social function of perpetuation and edification, each museum has its own context and creates its own form of representation and rhetoric, as well as the measure of memory performance about the events of Jewish history. The concepts and exhibitions of these museums are embedded in a context of general social debate about the trauma, its principal expressibility, mediatization and visualization. The research field of trauma contains an internal contradiction. On the one hand, the field employs the psychoanalytic idea of the inexpressible injury (Theodor Adorno, Jean-François Lyotard, Shoshana Felman, Dori Laub, Cathy Caruth et al.), while, on the other hand, subscribing to the concept of its globalization and mediatization (Wulf Kansteiner, Ann Kaplan, Jeffrey Aleksander, Andreas Huyssen). The discourse about the Holocaust is globalized, but the memory of the Holocaust victims is functioning glocally, taking into account the specific local context of traumatic events. Consequently, the museification of the Holocaust generates a diverse field of aesthetic representations. The article stresses the peculiarity of these museums, such as their focus on sensual work with the past, their call for the exchange of experiences and emotions in addition to rational knowledge, their invitation to identify with the experience. In comparison to museums, it becomes evident that modern museum exhibitions and performances variably provoke the visitor to identify with the collective subject of history through a simulated experience of the suffering of others. This is impossible without emotions, sympathy and working memory. However, the therapeutically simulated traumatization through acquaintance with the phenomenon of the Holocaust is not justified in any socio-political and cultural context.",Cultural trauma; Memory; Representation; The Holocaust Museum,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041025671

The discussions around this research circle can be traced to the destructive experience of revolution and civil war, and the shift from conventional forms of debate to the abuse and annihilation of opponents, transforming the latter practices into the new mainstream. The discussion as such becomes a race for power, or a straight-up competition between political groups. In turn, literary criticism also starts reproducing the repressive methods of the victor. The so-called “formalists” represent the most prominent example of this process, as they were sentenced to annihilation as pure ideological enemies of the new hegemonic class — both in a political and cultural sense. The contrast dualism that characterizes the opposition between ‘us’ and ‘them’ in Russian culture to the present day became visible during that time, as the triumphant class was fundamentally unwilling to compromise with the defeated. The Bolsheviks were not feeling magnanimous after the victory of the October revolution. Their strategy was to cultivate hatred, pitting different groups against each other under the banner of class struggle in order to further strip and/or remove any phenomena diverging from the established way forward. The primary motivation for the crackdown through terror was civil war. Subsequently, it was replaced by the requirement for special vigilance during the temporary resurgence of the bourgeoisie in the period of New Economic Policy (NEP). The conceptualization of the NEP was not only an economic and industrial, but also inevitably a cultural matter, and the proletariat simply had to feel threatened by the surviving oppressors whose consciousness remained the same as before the revolution. Ultimately, the announced and long-awaited rejection of the NEP and its “restorative” culture legitimized a new round of aggressive rhetoric that reinforced the internal crisis of the Soviet “poputchiks” (primarily discriminated intelligentsia) and allowed to put an end to them on the cusp of the 1920s and 1930s.",Bolshevik revolution; Class struggle; Discussion in literature; Literary criticism; Polemics; Rhetoric of competition; Russian formalism,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041024694

The present paper deals with a political scientific text ""The Roots of Revolutionary Ideology"" by the outstanding American politologist A.J. Gregor. Recent years have seen the growing interest to personological knowledge represented by conceptual metaphors in personotexts from different discourses. Based on the premise that personological knowledge is manifested in original metaphors, this research aims to reconstruct Gregor's original metaphorical models at different stages of cognition. The study was carried out in four steps using the method of functional-stylistic analysis, the Pragglejaz method, Gurin and Belikova's algorithm for metaphor classification and, finally, G. Steen's methodology. First, the analysed political scientific text was broken into subtexts (problem stating, hypothetical, substantiating and deducing) correlating with different stages of cognition. Second, there were metaphors found in each of the subtexts using the Pragglejaz method for metaphor identification. Metaphors are different in terms of personological knowledge representation. Thus, they were divided into conventional and original applying Gurin and Belikova's algorithm. In the research original metaphors included both individual mapping of the source and target domains and individual filling of slots in case of conventionalised cross-domain mapping. Only original metaphors were further analysed using G. Steen's five-step methodology: finding a metaphorical focus, proposition, comparison, analogy and mapping. As a result original metaphorical models were reconstructed for each subtext: REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY IS A HUMAN BEING, REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY IS AN ANIMAL, and REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY IS INANIMATE NATURE in the problem stating-hypothetical subtext; REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY IS A HUMAN BEING, REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY IS AN ARTEFACT and REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY IS A SOCIAL INSTITUTION in the substantiating subtext; REVOLUTIONARY IDEOLOGY IS A SOCIAL INSTITUTION (MATHEMATICS) in the deducing subtext. The reconstructed models allowed concluding about Gregor's personological knowledge manifested in his metaphorical ideas at different stages of cognition. Thus, the problem is that revolutions are human, but revolutionary ideology is inhuman. Gregor hypothesises and proves that revolutionary ideology was created by humans artificially (an artefact) using exact calculation (mathematics) and it is relative to time and circumstances. Content analysis showed that 50% of Gregor's original metaphors are SOCIOUMORPHOUS with a half of them referring to the MATHEMATICS conceptual domain. ANTHROPOMORPHOUS AND ARTEFACTUAL original metaphors have equal numbers - 20% in each group, while NATUREMORPHOUS original metaphors are the least -10%. So, it may be concluded that Gregor opposes socio-political life and nature regarding revolutionary ideology as an artificial product of human activity.",Conceptual metaphor; Metaphorical model; Personological knowledge; Political scientific text; Subtext,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041003754

As the former sibilant is commonly described as a geminated sound and Russian prohibits long consonants in positions near other consonants, the assimilation process can potentially lead to neutralisation in such minimal pairs of word combinations as proyavila shchedrost' [(she) showed generosity] and proyavilas' shchedrost' [generosity showed itself]. The participants of the experiment, 20 native Russian speakers (10 men and 10 women aged 18 to 40), were instructed to read a list of sentences that included 8 minimal pairs of target word combinations embedded in carrier phrases. All stimuli were recorded in intervocalic position; phrasal accent on stimuli was avoided; accent structure of the target word combinations was deliberately varied (clusters were recorded in all possible positions with regard to stressed and unstressed vowels). All recordings were analysed using computer software Praat. The duration and homogeneity of fricative noise were measured. Spectral analysis showed that in 78% of cases place assimilation of sibilants at word boundaries was complete. The measurements of duration confirmed that this parameter could vary widely, mostly in connection with stress. The duration of [e(:)] sounds within minimal pairs pronounced by the same speaker showed that in similar conditions in 95.5% of cases the sound representing the underlying /sj#e:/ was longer than the surface representation of the underlying /#e:/ (mean difference 34,9 ms; mean duration ratio 1,26). In order to find out whether these durational differences can be used by native speakers to distinguish minimal pairs a perception experiment was conducted. 15 native speakers, students aged 17-19, were presented with 35 stimuli (word consequences recorded during the described above experiment, but removed from phrasal context; the duration of the fricative varied widely from 135 to 202 ms). The participants' task was to write down what they think they heard. Their responses demonstrated that they could not reliably distinguish tokens with place assimilation of underlying /sj/ (the number of correct guesses was at a chance rate - 50.8%) and tokens without underlying /sj/ (the number of correct guesses was only slightly larger - 57.1%) despite the significant durational differences. The described phenomenon can be interpreted as a case of incomplete neutralisation. The experiments showed that the neutralisation of /#e:/ and /sj#e:/ at word boundaries in Russian is phonetically incomplete due to the significant durational differences between the produced fricatives, although these acoustic cues were not used by native speakers in distinguishing minimal pairs.",Coarticulation; External sandhi; Fricatives; Incomplete neutralisation; Modern Standard Russian; Phonetics; Place assimilation,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040978001

The problem (dead) zones and dropped calls are now among the most critical issues that mobile providers tend to solve, while trying to increase the quality of service at the same time. The paper discusses modeling approaches to the cellular network's problem zones detection and analysis, on the basis of complaints, subscribers and base stations data aggregation and analysis. We describe algorithms to be used in building Heat Map geo-spatial visualizations of cellular network data, which show the distribution of problem zones within the network with their corresponding weights assigned according to the amount of complaints and population density in the area. This information is used in prioritization of distributed problem zones for the cellular network development and decision support on new base station deployment. It means that simulation-based approaches to problem zone detection and fixation in cellular network can help to increase the customer satisfaction of connection level and quality of mobile service. In addition, the paper presents the evaluation of economic effect of solving the problem zone issue that follows the subscriber traffic increase.",Base station; Cellular network; Problem zones; Smart management; Visual simulation,Base stations; Customer satisfaction; Decision support systems; Manufacture; Mobile telecommunication systems; Population statistics; Quality of service; Visualization; Wireless networks; Cellular network; Cellular network infrastructure; Corresponding weights; Decision supports; Distributed problems; Population densities; Simulation based approaches; Visual simulation; Problem solving,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040745426

He combined two approaches - infrastructure and regulatory. He revealed a correlation between the state regulation of funeral infrastructure and institutional models. There are three ideal models (highlighted based upon who the respective infrastructure belongs to): state, church, private, as well as variations of a mixed model. However, Walter's models relate only to the experience of Western Europe and the United States. The author of this article attempts to address this omission. The author tries to incorporate the experience of Russia's modern burial industry into Walter's typology. This article has several objectives. First of all, to introduce Russian readers to the context of burial industry development. Such information has not yet been published in Russian. Secondly, presenting attempts to interpret the differences in the formation of national funeral service markets using Walter's model. Third, trying to expose the serious limitations of the proposed model when attempting to apply it to the situation in Russia. The author argues that the Soviet model can be described as an institutional autonomy which came to be within the context of rural traditional cultural development. Modern Russia has inherited that old institutional model and enforces it under federal law, delegating all activities to the local authorities, who use government infrastructure to generate profit, while restricting access to such services for consumers. Therefore, state funeral infrastructure has led not to the emergence and development of private companies which provide burial services, but has rather relegated the private sector to becoming an intermediary. Tony Walter's models, working within the regulatory context, were loosely applied to the case of the Russian burial industry.",Anthropology of death; Burial industry; Funeral; Funeral market; Infrastructure; Sociology of death,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039983510

The first group contains an unavoidable often over-simplified representation of socioeconomic processes on behalf of the state for the sake of registrability. A number of other conceptual and methodological factors also form this group. The second focuses on the problems of unintended systematical real methods of primary data collection and processing differences from the formal, and also on the distortions of statistics associated with the specifics of the administrative-territorial information gathering system. In other words, the technological restrictions and distortions are gathered in the second section. The third group includes the deliberate falsification of indicators to improve the assessment of authorities' efficiency, together with other deformations of socio-psychological origin arising due to the fact that statistics are not a neutral tool. The purpose of this article is to systematize and give a detailed description of the mechanisms of socio-economic and other processes of distortion by means of the optics of authorities, as well as to formulate possible ways of improving the quality of information. The following tasks are identified in order to achieve the main objective: a consistent detailed consideration of the causes and consequences of the restrictions and distortions, a rethinking and factor classifying of the content of domestic and foreign research on this topic through the results of our own field qualitative research. The author concludes that official statistics in the Russian Federation have lost their referential function; also there is an increasing gap between those indicators accumulated by the subjects of official statistical accounting, together with the image of reality formed on their basis, and the reality itself. ""The dead zones"" (processes, objects, aspects and features which are not visible to the managers) are found in all sectors of society and authority's activity: in the assessments of economic activity, social status and living standards of the population, recording offences and crimes, registration of municipal property - in some cases it can be large-scale and in other cases it could be relatively insignificant. The author assumes that poor quality of information is one of the major reasons for the inefficiency of domestic public administration. The described conditions of the system seem to be an institutional trap; the transformation of official statistics, registration processes and authorities' vision system can only come at significant a cost, and so the status quo remains standing. The author offers possible ways to solve the considered issues, in case the government does see the need to improve the quality of statistical data.",Data manipulation; Public administration; State records and registration; Statistics,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039981420

Decentralization is important for firms' growth and development. While in the absence of decentralization a firm's growth opportunities are limited by time and abilities of its CEO, decentralization opens doors for quicker decision-making on a larger range of questions and creates room for the firm's growth. However, decentralization is associated with agency risks and risks of information leakage. Weak judicial system, high corruption, and low level of trust increase risks associated with decentralization and, therefore, can significantly limit firms' opportunities for decentralization. In this paper the author empirically explores the influence of corruption, quality of court system and trust on decentralization of decision-making at firms in the Russian regions. The empirical analysis presented in the paper demonstrates the important limiting influence of corruption on decentralization of decision-making at Russian firms. In the regions with higher corruption firms are less likely to decentralize and more likely to choose a management model with centralized decision-making and selection of people for top positions through connections.

Examples of indicators used by political scientists include parliamentary questions, parliamentary debates or hearings, parliamentary inquiries and legislative initiatives. Moreover, this paper provides an overview of factors deemed to be the most important for the development of an agenda-setting research and the key direction of academic literature in this field. The article contains a critique of the main agenda-setting conceptual models. The current conceptual trends of this approach are outlined, which includes the break with American-based agenda-setting theory, the spread of comparative analysis, the development of quantitatively oriented policy methods, and the increase in policy dynamics research. The relationship between mass media and political agenda, political parties' influence on the political agenda are also highlighted in the latest empirical studies. Different viewpoints on the media impact are shown: media as a source of their own agenda, media as a resource for promotion of separate issues, and media as a tool of influence over the agendas of political actors. The results are based on an analysis of few research projects that were represented in Web of Science publications with the highest citation index. Publications were selected by using the topic ""Agenda Setting"" in the category ""Political Science"", without selection of a definite time period. Statistics of co-citation were analysed and a co-citation map was created by dint of the VOSviewer computer program.",Parliament agenda; Policy agenda-setting,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032940974

The neo-Malthusian perspective asserts that the consequences of a rapid population growth are mostly negative and include contributing to absolute poverty, rural overcrowding, pressure on physical and social infrastructures as well as undermining the social order, functions of the State and international relations. It is related to the concept of demographic transition and includes anti-natalism implemented through family planning programs. It constitutes the foundation of international policies pursued by several Western governments, primarily of the United States, even though consecutive U.S. Administrations could not espouse this perspective because of political constraints. When this was done in 1970s, ample American technical assistance and financial aid to population programs flew to developing countries, leading the way for many other Western states. Overall, the impact of family planning programs on fertility was substantial, and they proliferated across the world. Anti-Malthusianism operates at a higher level of abstraction since it assumes a positive relationship between population growth and development, which does not have empirical verifications. In 1960s-1970s, the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group of 77 have raised the banner of anti-Malthusianism in their confrontation with the West. Nevertheless, the first United Nations World Population Conference (1974) has reached a relatively brave consensus which was instrumental in defusing the population bomb. Subsequently, that consensus was diluted by delinking a population growth from the need to subdue it through anti-natalist policies. The paramount global issue of a rapid population growth was absent in deliberations and final documents adopted at the United Nations conferences of 1984 and 1994. Concurrently, practical programs keep spreading and developing, but not in all countries where they are particularly needed. The fading of the donor countries' interest reveals a short-sighted approach, because in some regions of the world, and especially in sub-Saharan countries, the demographic transition is not likely to end soon by itself. In the meantime, a several-fold population increase will jeopardize their development prospects, putting some of them at the edge of humanitarian catastrophes.",Africa South of Sahara; Bangladesh; China; Demographic transition; Family planning programs; Population bomb; Population policies; United States,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032909410

The authors used econometric analysis to determine the inverse relationship between barriers in infrastructure services and the degree of countries' participation in global value chains. Using data on the structure of trade in goods and services in terms of value added, they analyzed the situation of developing countries through the example of the BRICS countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa in production and service GVCs. They found China and India to be the most deeply integrated in the international production and service chains. Russia, Brazil and South Africa are included in production value chains more as suppliers of raw materials and intermediate goods with low added value, but nonetheless have significant potential to expand their participation in international production systems, in particular by improving the infrastructure necessary for GVCs. Based on the study of liberalization of certain service sectors in BRICS countries, the authors noted the positive impacts of reducing barriers in maritime, rail and air transportation and of finance for improving the quality and reducing the cost of services. In many respects, these effects were the result not only of reducing barriers in services, but also of implementing measures to increase a country's investment attractiveness. The article concludes that the liberalization of infrastructure services industries can become one of the tools for integrating the BRICS countries into GVCs. However, this liberalization should be part of a broader development strategy that includes trade and investment policy measures to increase participation in global production and the overall economic development of the country.",BRICS; Global value chains; Liberalization; Service sector; Value added,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032747367

A. Smith Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis, 1890 to 1928 (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2017). As a leading expert in the social history of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Smith provides a comprehensive political, social, and cultural narrative of one of the central events in the global history of the twentieth century. Directed at a general readership, the book offers an excellent overview of existing Russian and Western scholarship, outlines the main course of events, introduces most important actors, and contains thought-provoking conclusions about the revolution. As seen from the title, Smith takes a longish view on the political rupture and includes a comprehensive analysis of social and political life of the Russian Empire, a brief overview of the First Russian Revolution (1905-1907) and the economic and political crisis of the First World War (1914-1918) before discussing the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Russian Civil War, and the period of the New Economic Policy (NEP). The book's conclusion is a comprehensive essay attempting to comprehend the revolution and its consequences as a whole. As a nuanced social, political, and cultural history, Russia in Revolution: An Empire in Crisis, 1890 to 1928 outlines the Revolution of 1917 as a tectonic shift which cannot be reduced to a simple change of the elites in the Russian imperial formation. Smith's brilliant work will be invaluable for the students of history, both in Russia and abroad, and all those who are interested in global history in general and the Russian Revolution in particular.",February Revolution; Historiography; NEP; October Revolution; Social History; Socialism; USSR,,English,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031119178

The ultra-royalist faction led by Mikhail Konstantinovich Diterikhs, which in 1922 controlled the Provisional Priamur Government in Vladivostok, portrayed the Romanovs as redeemers who had ended the ""dark age"" of the Time of Troubles (1598-1613) and called for a new Zemskii Sobor to elect a Romanov Tsar for the sake of new redemption from the ""foreign"" Bolsheviks. The socialist faction of the Far Eastern Republic (FER), taken over by the Bolsheviks, focused on the grievances caused by the Romanovs' policies and the clashes with Japan and stressed the future role of the Russians as the first nation of toilers to lead the global struggle for social justice. The popular monarchist faction, established by Grigorii Mikhailovich Semenov, tried to find a middle ground by emphasising the popular role in ending the Time of Troubles and agitating for an elected muzhik Tsar. The ultra-royalist and monarchist rhetoric failed to mobilize the people of the Far East who did not identify with the Eurocentric images of the past and rebuked the cooperation between the monarchists and Japan. The socialist claims that the Romanovs and the Japanese accounted for the degraded present proved more relevant in view of the regional historical narrative featuring a series of conflicts with East Asian states, while the economic rather than racial interpretation of the Japanese policies and the inclusive character of socialism did not alienate ethnic minorities from the socialist faction.",Monarchism; Nationalism; Russian civil war; Russian Far East; Socialism,,English,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031089649

In sociological research, the term ""social network"" usually refers to a complex of close and distant acquaintances that connect people in a certain geographical locality, and/or in a certain social cluster. However, if regarding the studies of Soviet and post- Soviet society, sociologists and political scientists usually use this term referring to the networks of corruption, coat-tails, a shady economy, etc., that ""corrode"" modern social and political institutes, hindering modernization. These can also refer to the secret networks of samizdat and dissidence in the 1960-70s. All of these networks can be defined as ""anti-disciplinary"". Apparently, in both the late Soviet and post-Soviet societies, networks of different types existed, and examples of these are described in the article. Nevertheless, all other networks aside from the ""anti-disciplinary"" ones are studied significantly less, and were never studied systematically. There are at least two types of causes that have entailed this ""blind spot"". The ""hidden"" networks in the late Soviet and post-Soviet societies were and are of great political significance and of a specific organization; thus, they are considered as structures unavoidable for the understanding of Russia's social dynamics and power relations. Secondly, Soviet society was based on a very complicated combination of modernizing and ""archaizing"" trends. This tension can be designated as ""conservative modernization"", as coined by the demographer Anatoly Vishnevsky. A study of the interrelation between ""pro-disciplinary"" and ""anti-disciplinary"" networks demands a reconsideration of some the basic theses of the theory of social networks. Here, I use Harrison White's theory in order to demonstrate the limits of its applicability to late Soviet society. © Centre for Fundamental Sociology, 2017.",Blat; Conservative modernization; Disciplinary state; Harrison White; Late Soviet society; Shady economy; Social networks,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030568635

Historically, there were four approaches to visuality in EM, those of visuality as observable activity, as images, as practices of vision, and as language constructions. Harold Garfinkel's idea of witnessability implies that the phenomena of order exist in observable methods of their production. Observability, or witnessability, at this point can be an equivalent for visuality because it suggests an opportunity to be studied with visual methods. In such a case, any ethnomethodological study is a visual study because it implies a description of observable methods of order production. Besides this idea of observability, three separate projects of visual research were developed in EM from 1980s to the 1990s by Michel Lynch, Charles Goodwin, and Jeff Coulter. They all tried to present the practical approach to visual perception (in contrast with perception as an individual psychological process), but found solutions in studying different aspects of visuality, which were images, practices of seeing, and language constructions describing different modes of perception. This text considers the relationships between the three conceptions and Garfinkel's initial idea of observability. It analyzes ideas which Lynch, Goodwin, and Coulter added to Garfinkel's ethnomethodological program, and shows how other ethnomethodologists use these additions. The article demonstrates that together they produced EM's approach to visuality, although none of these projects were completely realized inside EM. It is based on Garfinkel's idea of observability, supplemented by the opportunity to study perception as a practical social achievement situated in local interactional contexts. © Centre for Fundamental Sociology, 2017.",Ethnomethodology; Images; Praxeology of perception; Professional vision; Scientific representations; Visuality; Witnessability,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030547327

Nevertheless, mediatization theory has its own heuristic prospects, which, among other things, are connected to the emergence of a concept of mediatized worlds. According to this approach, processes of mediatization of culture and society should be studied on a level of particular ""social worlds"" and/ or ""small life-worlds"" articulated through media communications.

The aim of this paper is to define major linguistic concepts reflecting the formation, development and functioning of German young people's slang. The research employs an objective approach based on characterization and methodical recording of evidence from the history of language, as well as an approach which is a part of the taxonomic method (when similar occurrences in science are compared to develop a theory in some area of linguistic knowledge). The research is based on monographs, articles and lectures by leading foreign linguists published in journals in the 18th-21st centuries, as well as lexicographical sources from this period. In the course of investigation three significant stages in the linguistic study of German youthspeak are identified. They are closely connected with historical periods when youth slang came into being and started to evolve. The first stage (the 18th century - the early 20th century) is the research into historical German students' slang (historische deutsche Studentensprache/Burschensprache). The earliest lexicographical sources of the students' slang go back to the 18th century and the first scholars who made the youthspeak part of the linguistic research were F. Kluge (1895) and J. Meier (1910). The scholars uncovered the sources of the vocabulary input, described the lexical-semantic processes in it and highlighted its interaction with Argo and colloquial language. Both F. Kluge and J. Meier point out that it is not enough to catalog the distinguishing characteristics of students' lexicon, it is vital to analyze its influence on the national language. Thus, in the linguistic findings of that period the first attempts to form general conclusions about youth-speak were made. The second stage (the first three decades of the 20th century) involved the research into historical German school language (historische deutsche Schülersprache/Pennälersprache). The main findings of that period belong to R. Eilenberger (1910) and F. Melzer (1928), who examined slang words and expressions in the context of real life led by school students, conducted the comparative analysis of school sociolect, the student-speak and other types of slang. The third stage (the 1950s - present) is concerned with the research into German young people's slang (allgemeine deutsche Jugendprache), which has included both the slang of the young people who study and of those who work. This period has seen more comprehensive examination of familiar and new contexts. Along with the traditional lexical characteristics, its phonetic and grammatical distinctive qualities have been analyzed (H. Henne), the youth-speak has been defined as a complex language register (P. Schlobinski), its most important distinguishing attributes have been described (H. Ehmann), and its usage in fiction and media (M. Chun) as well as the Internet (J. Androutsopoulos) has been studied. The numerous works by E. Neuland are also worth mentioning; the scholar characterizes youth-speak as an evolving entity, as an international, historical and group phenomenon, the phenomenon in media, human interactions and language consciousness. The analysis of the trends and approaches to German youth-speak in the 18th-21st centuries, comparison of its vocabulary, spelling and grammar over different periods of time have resulted in the following findings: 1. German youth-speak is a historical phenomenon going back to the past centuries rather than a modern linguistic product. 2. At the initial stage German youth-speak was based on the national language and used semantic and word-building elements of ancient languages. Later on it expanded through metaphorization of the vocabulary in general use, word-building derivation and borrowings. 3. Historical students' slang, historical school pupils' slang and modern young people's slang are different stages in the evolution of one and the same phenomenon - German youth-speak.",Dynamic process; German; Historical period; Linguistic object; Youth jargon,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029878919

Patterson's The International) and The Irish Times (rubric ""Opinions"", 1996, 245 texts) are chosen for the research. 1996 is chosen as one of the acute moments of the standoff for the reason of ceasefire cessation. The paper provides theoretical underpinning for the approaches to terminology used, describes the developed methodology and presents the results for the media discourse analysis. In this research discourse is understood as a complex communicative-cognitive issue capturing both texts and extra linguistic factors. The authors consider the novels and newspapers to be essentials of the whole issue rhetoric, understanding media and literary discourses as parts of public discourse. The concept ""The Troubles"" is understood as a dynamic structured cognition of the idea of ethnopolitical, religious and territorial relations between Catholics and Protestants in the Northern Ireland unambiguously perceived by the recipients as a conflict. The first methodological step of the research is definitional analysis of ""The Troubles"". It resulted in grouping its cognitive criteria: Political Organizations, Political Orientation, War, Religion, Authorities, Election, Media, Peace, People, Place, Conversation. The second step is building the core and the periphery of the concept using AntConc3.2.4w software and principles of corpus linguistics. The third is analyzing language features of ""The Troubles"" nominative field. The final step is describing cultural and evaluating particularity of the language features described. The authors concluded that the ideas of conflicting parts exclusiveness are in the core of the concept, with Participants and Places of the events substantially presented. However, the cognitive criteria, sociocultural markers, characterized by striving for peaceful reconcilement of counterparts should not be underestimated, for they build the basis for the concept language representation upsides with the main cognitive criteria. The Irish Times in its entirety upholds a rather neutral presentation of ""The Troubles"", while in the literary discourse the situation may be adverse. The investigated time period and the only rubric ""Opinions"" restrict the research. The media discourse is much more diverse. But these restrictions make it possible to proceed with describing the evaluative features of the concept as well as with investigating other media materials, for example, movies.",Cognitive criterion; Literary discourse; Media discourse; Sociocultural concept; The Troubles,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029849178

Like other post-soviet countries, in the early 90s, Russia faced a period of sharp decline in real household incomes followed by gradual growth of the welfare of the population. However, income inequality remained a burning problem throughout this time. The poverty headcount is still about 13% on the average and varies greatly depending on territories and socio-demographic groups. Russian poverty has clear specifics: there is a high risk of poverty for families with children. This paper analyses effectiveness of child benefits from various perspectives. We estimate the benefits' impact on the poverty of families with children using the concepts of absolute, relative and subjective poverty. The study is based on the pooled and panel household data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey conducted by the Higher School of Economics (RLMS HSE) in 2003-2015. We assess the influence of the child benefits on the probability of poverty using various econometric models. The results are robust and show that the system of child benefits all in all reduce the risk of absolute and relative poverty of the households. However, the subjective perception of poverty is positively correlated with the benefits. The study also reveals leaks and significant gaps in the coverage of poor families with the system of child benefits. Overall, the study confirms low effectiveness of the child benefits system in Russia and indicates a need for improving its targeting.",Absolute poverty; Child benefits; Relative poverty; Russia; Subjective poverty,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028985986

This article presents the results of the thematic content analysis of 723 media publications devoted to issues related to the family, published between 2000 and 2015 in six Russian newspapers, divided into two groups: state-owned and private, representing different political orientation. The mathematical processing of the data gathered by the content analysis was performed using Fisher's angular transformation (to evaluate differences in proportion of each of the topics in the general thematic structure of state and private media publications for the two periods of 2000-2006 and 2007-2015) and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to explore the relations between topics in the media publications about the family. Both state and private Russian media after 2006 convey normative family model, designed to solve the demographic problem and increase fertility. Questions of biopolitics and adoption, having many children began to take a larger share in the publication thematic structure of media of both types. Woman as the main object of pro-natalist family policy is presented in the media in relation to three aspects: the inner world of family, in the interaction with the community and as part of the state and public perceptions of the family.

While behavior of an individual prostitute as an economic agent has been modeled in a number of papers, those models have rarely been supported by quantitative evaluations. The present article follows contemporary approaches to economic analysis of prostitution and at the same time makes use of the benefits that the Internet has brought to this type of service. In comparison to the recent past, modern individual prostitutes have much more opportunities to contact their clients online without the help of pimps or other intermediaries. Thus, the roles of market participants, the structure of risks, as well as price-setting mechanisms have significantly changed. In order to evaluate factors affecting prices set by Moscow prostitutes offering their services online, the article employs a hedonic pricing method. The authors show that the key factors are the location, where services are provided, and the quality of a profile picture as a proxy for costs incurred by a prostitute in order to raise the attractiveness of her website profile and her personal appeal. These results may be useful for further analysis of how prices and revenues in the prostitution market are related to legal markets and could be a part of a potential government policy regarding prostitution.",Economics of prostitution; Hedonic prices; Online prostitution; Pricing analysis,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026490237

We study the situation when the university's founder has to delegate decision making power and choose among several types of governance. The first type of governance is sharing governance; in this case the decision is made on the basis of majority voting. The second type is autocratic governance without rotation. The third type is autocratic governance with rotation, and finally we have governance when the decisions are made by a committee. If the founder cannot assess the preferences of professors and choose professors with specific characteristics, sharing governance gives the best results. This happens since the interests of all professors are taken into account which in turn decreases the moral hazard. The second best chose is to delegate the decision to a committee.

Our results show that relationship between fixed investments and investments in acquisitions is opposite for two periods. In the first period, relationship between two types of investment was positive or insignificant which possibly means that companies did not face the trade-off between investment forms. After the global financial crisis, when monetary conditions and access to external capital markets for Russia tightened considerably, the relationship between investment in new capital and investment in acquisitions became negative. It proves that companies faced a trade-off between two investment forms. Moreover, acquisitions became dependent on company's profitability. Such a trade-off can be crucial for developing economies since they are more dependent on external financing.

In order to bring scientists into the sector of research and development, as well as maintain the competitiveness of national science, a special environment must be created, which will encourage a high level of self-motivation among researchers. The analysis of motivation patterns of researchers provided in this paper is based on data from the international project, ""Careers of Doctorate Holders"" (CDH), and its Russian counterpart, ""Monitoring Survey of Highly Qualified R&D Personnel"". One of the goals was to investigate the stability and variability of researcher's motivation during the different periods in one's career: choice of profession, current work activity and a hypothetical job change. The eight most common patterns of motivation were identified and they can be considered the basic motivational structures of researchers. The most significant feature of these patterns includes a focus on the creative and innovative nature of scientific work. The second most important component is the independence and relative autonomy, which is typical for research activity. Economic motives are rarely important when choosing an academic career; however, they play an important instrumental role during actual research work, since an appropriate material base is required for the successful achievement of a researcher's professional goals. A hypothetical situation of a job change, including moving abroad (for a long or limited amount of time) also shows the priority of internal personal motives over external ones, which are associated with material conditions. The opportunity for professional and personal achievements plays the role of a trigger for the high level of motivation of Research and Development (R&D) personnel. The main drivers of research motivation are self-realization, improvement of skills and competences, therefore the professional environment must be organized properly to promote the advancement of intellectual workers. Management based primarily on the external rewards may even reduce personal motivation, since it transforms people's natural enthusiasm and turns their interest solely to material goods. The research results obtained give us reason to argue that the Russian scientific policy agenda must include the creation and maintenance of adequate conditions in which research potential can be fully realized and where the personal reputation of the scientist will be recognized.",Doctorate holders; R and d; Research motivation; Science and technology management; Scientific career; Scientific personnel,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026294625

The study is based on the constructionist research program developed by Peter Ibarra and John Kitsuse, and focuses on the identification of the discursive ways of problematization used by Dagestan youth in relation to ""outgo to ISIL"" and ""outgoing"" young people. The young Dagestanians occasionally use the rhetoric of endangerment, including the metaphor of a ""virus"". However, the dominant rhetoric is the rhetoric of unreason. The terms used in the description of those who ""went to ISIL"" correspond to this idiom's vocabulary. The image of manipulation which is central for the rhetoric of unreason is detailed by constructing the image of ""recruiter"". One of the identified features of the talk of the ""outgo to ISIL"" was episodic, that is, different from the previous and subsequent phrases and utterances of young people in accordance with the official discourse, supposedly in order to protect themselves from a possible suspicion of sympathy for ISIL. However, the rhetoric of unreason indicates a lack of social distance between young Dagestanians and those who have ""went"".

Firstly, it is the connection of group cultural practices and specific places/spaces that allows for the comparison of the configuration of youth communities and cultural coalitions in different geographical locations (cities, countries, or regions). Secondly, the focus here shifts from the analysis of cultural texts and discourses to the implicit rules and meanings according to which individuals produce a ""scene"" in a particular place/space and time. The concept of ""scene"" can be used productively in the solidarity approach.

Selection strategy, in turn, is communicated within defined constraints. In totalitarian discourse conditions, the servants are unlikely to have a chance of achieving a more-or-less independent positioning or high mobility. The cultural context constructs a hierarchical submission, its structure, and functionality. Therefore, the rational life in European culture can be contrasted with the more-sweeping economic style taking place in Russian cultural tradition.

It allows states to improve the quality of national human resources and the national education system. Thus, it is particularly important for transition economies in the context of an innovative model of development. Russia and China turned to this practice in 2010 after the launch of the SCO University, established by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Today joint educational institutions function not only multilaterally but also bilaterally. This article examines the Shenzhen MSU-BIT University, a joint Russian- Chinese university, as a tool to promote the national interests of the two countries. The author presents the basic history of Russian-Chinese cooperation in education in the second half of the 20th century. She argues that the Cultural Revolution and period the subsequent of difficult relations between the two countries had a negative impact on educational ties. Russia lost 17 years in China's educational market, which was filled by other countries, primarily the United States. At the beginning of the 20th century, Russian-Chinese humanitarian cooperation was positive. The author relates the increase in the volume of Russian-Chinese educational exchange to the success of several events, including the large-scale projects of the Year of Russia in China and the Year of China in Russia, the Year of Chinese Language in Russia and Russian Language in China, the opening of the Russian Cultural Centre and the Chinese Cultural Centre, Russian centres and cabinets of the ""Russian World"" in China, and Confucius Institutes and classes in Russia. After analyzing the current situation, the author describes the new forms of cooperation, which include the opening of joint institutions. She assesses the interests and prospects of Russian and Chinese participation in the creation of the Shenzhen MSU-BIT University through the prism of national interests. Her methodology is based on the principles of integrated research and relies on sources, using problem-chronological and comparative methods, content analysis and event analysis. The author also refers to similar projects between China and the United States, Australia and several European countries. She stresses that joint institutions contribute to the competitiveness of educational services of the participating countries, and also serve as an effective tool for promoting national culture, language, values and lifestyles. The author demonstrates the advantages of this form of cooperation for Russia and China as a new mechanism of collective cooperation. The author concludes that Russia is interested in establishing joint educational institutions with China primarily as an instrument of soft power that can increase the competitiveness of Russian education, not only in China but throughout Asia, and can promote the Russian language. For China, it is important to get access to Russian intellectual resources for its further socioeconomic development. She ends with a proposal for the creation of a Russian-Chinese university that could contribute to the successful implementation of this project.",China; Intellectual resources; Internationalization of education; Joint university; Russia,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021359376

A survey of Moscow school students of grades 5-10 is used to explore the basic characteristics of children's independent mobility, including their everyday mobility, i. e. frequented places and the distance to them. It is shown that children normally travel within a radius of 1 km from home; the central part of the city and the neighboring districts are visited less often than places within the home district. A comparison of everyday mobility of high- and low-performing students has proved that the proportion of children whose most frequented place is centers for after-school education is higher among high-performers. Yet, no correlation was found between the size of the ""habitat"" and academic performance. Moreover, places for leisure, including leisure education, of families have been described based on a survey of over 700 mothers of school students.

The criteria were grouped into so-called spheres, describing how teenagers behave among peers, at home, and at school. The key behavioral characteristic was the indicators of the emerging feeling of adulthood in school children, i. e. of the drive for grown-up behavior, associated with freedom and responsibility. These criteria formed the basis of the 2016 observation program. The diversity of adolescent behavioral patterns has been found to be much greater than in the original study. In addition, the linear formula of the value of learning being replaced with that of communication with peers (close interpersonal relationships) has been brought into question. As it transpires, the value of learning remains high for most fifth-graders, regardless of whether they need communication or not. Such an attitude towards learning might be encouraged by family and school, which is typical for this category of children. Four types of school students have been identified based on the indicators of their interest in learning and communication.

The idea of self-mastery as the central explanatory concept and its relation to the modern concept of agency. 3. The role of self-reflective awareness in personality development. 4. Personality development pathways in challenging conditions. In Vygotsky's works personality was implicitly constructed as the most integral higher mental function, while self-mastery or self-regulation was its central feature. Vygotsky's principle of mediation states that the structure of human activity is mediated by physical or mental tools that break the S - R links and make it possible to master one's own behavior and mental processes. By utilizing speech as a system of signs that enables the process of mastering the psychosocial reality, self-reflection makes a new basis for more complicated forms of higher mental processes that possesses more degr ees of free - dom as compared with the lower ones.

The analysis showed the presence of stable groups of countries, including the groups of mainly exporting and mainly importing agricultural products. The share of the third group of countries with the varying sign of the balance of export and import amounted to only 30%. The factors influencing the formation of groups, in particular, were the role of water resources in terms of their scale and efficiency of use. The study of the impact of export and import of agricultural products on the indicators related to environmental and social risks identified significant problematic dependencies.

This legal order has its own narrative, principles, hierarchy of rules, and innovations such as the direct applicability of decisions of its regulatory body. Russian legal order is generally accommodating towards international law, which is equally applicable to Union law. However, the recent practice of the Russian Constitutional Court has claimed that Russia can set aside international obligations based on national constitution, which indirectly targets the viability of the EAEU legal order. This is further complicated by the Eurasian judiciary, which, as the main interpretative authority within the integration, has tried to take on an activist role, somewhat borrowing approaches from the European Union. In its turn, the Russian Constitutional Court has voiced its differences in certain approaches. This variability of practices and approaches clearly undermines the “unity” of the EAEU legal order and the interweaving of national and regional legal frameworks. This article analyses the relationship of the two legal orders to assess the possibilities for tensions between them. It points out the sources of such tensions, which lie in certain indeterminacies within the EAEU legal order, temptations to assert power, and recent far-reaching practices of the Russian Constitutional Court. © 2017, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

However, in Russia labor protests come up for discussion much more frequently than strikes. In recent years the number of labor protests in Russia, including various forms of work stoppage, has increased significantly compared to previous years, but the number of legally constituted collective labor disputes and strikes has remained very low. The legislation on resolution of collective labor disputes and mounting strikes is quite restrictive in Russia, and its enforcement also encourages employees to seek alternative ways to settle collective labor conflicts. There is little empirical research on the judicial implementation of these norms and its influence on the enforcement of legislation. Therefore, this paper analyses the reasoning of courts in cases on the legality of strikes, their interpretations of the law, and the impact these decisions have on the enforcement of the legislation on resolution of collective labor disputes and strikes. Our conclusion is that the courts act as another restrictive influence on the resolution of collective labor disputes and the exercise of the right to strike in Russia. © 2017, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

This article presents the results of research dedicated to revealing the correlation between cultural values and economic attitudes among different generations of Russians (N = 110 people). The participants were youth (18-25 years old) and adults (37-63 years). I found that, for the adult generation, the ""power-distance"" index (a measure of the level of dependence on power structures) was positively correlated with economic self-determination and the desire to have money. For the younger generation, neither the power-distance index nor the ""masculinity"" index was associated with economic autonomy, while the ""uncertainty-avoidance"" index encouraged economic autonomy but did not create additional opportunities for increasing personal income. In the study economic paternalism was expressed more by the younger generation; they were also more ready to invest energy in business, but they were not as interested as the adult generation in the state of the economy. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2017.",Culture; Economic attitudes; Intergenerational differences; Values,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019255197

It is apparent that a great deal of research has been focused on thought as an area of study. However, there is no psychological theory of thought which provides an explanation for its nature and structural organization. So far, researchers have mainly looked at the ways this concept is expressed, rather than investigating what it actually is. In this study, however, based on studies of the functions of the psyche, mental processes, and the neurophysiological bases of mental activity, thought is identified as a need-emotion-intentional substance existing in the human being's inner world. In keeping with this understanding of thought, the hypothesis that thought generation is caused by desire and experience (feeling and emotion) is put forward. An individual's thought is linked to his behavior or motivation for activity, and is followed by an emotional experience. The process of thought generation is regarded through the mechanism of behavioral motivation. The primary purpose of this mechanism is to define the qualities of the external objects that serve for need satisfaction and functionality in individuals. The ability to generate thoughts is a feature of thinking related to an individual's mental ability or frame of mind. From this standpoint, a person's mentality is considered to be the capacity of the individual to generate thoughts and work through thoughts. It is shown that the ability to generate thoughts and establish relationships within a stream of consciousness is characteristic of human intelligence. Some basic propositions toward a development of a psychological theory of thought are introduced. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2017.",Function of the psyche; Mental processes; Substantial thought; Thinking ontology; Thought,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019226485

Data for the analysis are the results of an associative experiment, one of research methods of language consciousness, which gives a possibility to reveal the systemacity of the content of an image of consciousness behind the word in culture, its ethnocultural specifics. With the leading role of the Russian language as a language for communication in the Republic of Buryatia, it was interesting to find out the common and specific features in the image ""darkhan"" in the language consciousness of the bilingual Buryat people and of the Buryats with Russian as a native language. The associative reactions classification ""semantic Gestalt"" by Yu.N. Karaulov is used for the analysis; it reflects the internal semantic organization of the associative field and characterizes the field as a complete unit of knowledge of the world. The article deals with the analysis of the lexicographic meanings of the word ""darkhan"" [smith]. Data of the Buryat-Russian dictionaries by S.M. Babushkin, L.D. Shagdarov and K.M. Cheremisov are attracted for the analysis; these are the most unabridged editions nowadays. In this work the functioning of the dictionary meanings of the word ""darkhan"" in the language consciousness of the bilingual Buryat people and the Buryats with native Russian is described. The psycholinguistic and lexicographic meanings of the word ""darkhan"" are considered in the article. The psycholinguistic word meaning (term of I.A Sternin and A.V. Rudakova) is understood as an ordered unity of all semantic components which staticizes a separate word in the consciousness of native speakers; it is a word meaning actually functioning in the language consciousness of native speakers. The result of the analysis has shown that the psycholinguistic word meaning is not always broader than lexicographic, recorded in explanatory dictionaries, as I.A. Sternin and A.V. Rudakova state. The meaning of the word ""darkhan"" in the Buryat culture is narrowed. One of the reasons of this process is the weak position of the Buryat language as the daily main language of communication in the Republic of Buryatia. At present, the first dictionary meaning of the word ""darkhan"", ""a smith, a handicraftsman, a craftsman working with metal, weapon and also with gold"", functions in the language consciousness of the Buryat. The bilingual Buryat people have the meaning ""a carpenter, a joiner, a builder working with stone and wood"".

Our assumption is that, in the implementation of her research program, Kozlova was trying to solve a double problem: on the one hand, to overcome the ideological framework posed by the concept of totalitarianism as the basic model of understanding Soviet society, and on the other, to understand Soviet society as an unintended social invention, In the framework of the model of Soviet society as an unintended social invention, classical social-theoretical views and conceptions enter into a complex theoretical alliance with the postclassical social theories of Norbert Elias, Michel Foucault, Michel de Certeau, and Pierre Bourdieu. The purpose of this strategy of research is to find adequate intellectual models and a basic theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between the individual and society. The qualification of the Soviet society as a social invention implies that a functional interdependent network of individuals arises in the course of common life of the individuals from the interactions between them. This network moves in a certain direction and has its own regularities, which, as specific patterns of relations between individuals, is not defined exactly by any one individual. The role of the basic model for the understanding of such a functional network of interdependent individuals does not play the model of the system, but the model of the common game and the social grammar, which is at the core of this game.

To determine the nature of this relationship, the article refers to the conceptual metaphors and ontological intuitions of the actor-network theory (ANT). Using ANT, the article articulates the concept of ""hybrid discourse"" that differs from the related concepts of social semiotics and postcolonial theory. This concept is used in a lesser degree to describe local communicative practices that mixes different languages, sociolects, ethnolects and functional styles of speech, and used in a higher degree to describe discursive constructions revealing the symptoms of hybrid activity on the borders of nature and culture. The article analyses the discursive practices of the New Age movement that invokes music, from theosophy in the late XIX century to modern esoteric-therapeutic narratives. In these discursive practices, we find the significant combination of pseudo-religious re-enchantment of the world and its radical nihilistic ""de-musicalization"" (in the terminology of Leo Spitzer). In hybrid esoteric discourses, the modern socio-acoustic texture of nature-culture is neutralized in favor of transcendent reality of the un-human. In Adorno's critical theory, ontological dualities are synthesized into the ideological totality of the culture industry. It is only in the early vanguard of the Second Viennese School that Adorno discovers the ghostly possibility of an exit from culture industry, achieving the true nature of music and non-alienated sociality.",Actor-network theory; Critical theory; Disenchantment; Hybrid discourse; Music therapy; Philosophy of music; Theosophy,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017218357

In her works of the 1990s on the sociology of everyday life and socio-historical anthropology, a unique methodology was developed for the investigation of the human dimension of ""modernization from above"" that was provided within the politics of building a socialist society in the USSR. Her research program was focused on the theoretical reconstruction of social practices and modes of existence of the «ordinary Soviet man», understood as an ""anthropological consequence"" of the attempt of the realization of the communist project in Russia. However, her intention for the ""disclosure of traces of little man in big history,"" as it was expressed by the researcher herself, has nothing to do with the ideology-laden discourse of ""totalitarianism."" N. N. Kozlova was not so interested in the forms of controlling the society as the lacunas in it, or in the techniques of totalitarian supremacy as in the practices of non-political resistance from below, or even in the totality as much as the discreteness of social matter of the new mass society. The ""wrong"" Soviet modern dropping out from the normative representations of Modernity was the main epistemological interest in her works, which is innovative from both the substantial and methodological standpoints. The investigative vision developed in Kozlova's works retains its heuristic significance even today when Russia is experiencing a ""Soviet Renaissance."" Moreover, her approaches to the study of the society of the ""new type"" allows for the anthropological understanding of the current state of our country. The paper reconstructs Kozlova's research program regarding Soviet sociality as an object of social philosophy and social anthropology.

Different types show different levels of satisfaction with their work time budget: those who do a lot of teaching and administrative work tend to be less satisfied. This can be explained by the changes in the system of faculty certification in Russia and by how academic staffresponds to those changes. Interview results are used to highlight the typical work time allocation problems faced by faculties.

The linguo-metaphysical isomorphism of the Timaeus presupposes that (1) words and material elements have their own meaning and nature respectively; (2) they can be reduced to an infinite variety of amorphic sounds and receptacle; (3) the participation in truth is possible only at the level of narrative and universe. According to this scheme the universe (κόσμος), as well as any speech (λόγος), can be explained by the reduction to its constituent elements, but it will be only necessary explanation.

In his recent book, Frederick Schauer answers the first question in the affirmative and proposes an interesting account of how it works. I believe that this claim is unsustainable due to the inconsistencies in the psychological account of coercion applied by Schauer, and his theory’s unrestricted reliance on counterfactuals. In what follows, I try to reconstruct the thesis on the coerciveness of the power-conferring legal rules. The basic insight is that the power-conferring legal rules coerciveness claim is inextricably connected to the unmoralized account of coercion, as any moralized theory shifts the problem from coercion to the issue of distributive justice. However, the unmoralized concept of coercion can hardly be coherent in law because it makes coercion a matter of context, dependent on the willpower of each individual, which threatens to eliminate the force of law as such. Even applied on its own terms, the unmoralized concept of coercion is unworkable within the context of power-conferring through law because power-conferring legal regimes do not eliminate non-legal alternatives, making it dependent on the will of the legal subjects themselves. Schauer’s everlasting contribution lies in his ingenious attempt to substantiate the coercion (of power-conferring rules) claim relying on counterfactuals. A (coerced) choice has been limited relative to some situation which never occurred but would or should have occurred. In order to limit a set of counterfactuals, making them realistic (preferences and needs are limited only by imagination), one should impose severe limits on them, which makes it impossible to characterize the particular situations described by Schauer as coercive in that sense. © 2017, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

Statistical data demonstrates that modern Russians tend to work more than 40 hours a week, thereby exceeding the legal time allowance that traces its roots back to a period when largescale manual labor was the norm. Increasing proportions of tertiary and quaternary sectors in the Russian economy suggests that the ""normal"" 40-hour work week is a redundant constraint and workers perceive the ""norm"" differently. According to the existing literature, overwork can reflect a worker's personality traits, and institutional or economic changes. In the research article, an analysis of the motives of overwork is provided. Also, evidence of the differences in perceptions of what constitutes a ""normal"" work day and mental borders between work and overwork is presented. It appears that employees perceive overwork not only as overtime work (the number of hours that they work in addition to their contractual hours), it can also be understood as a work-life imbalance, undesirable dramatic change in lifestyle due to the demands of work, and a psychological and/or physical fatigue that can lead to the loss of a ""zest for life."" The following motives were identified: economic (working additional hours for career advancement, salary growth, or at least job security in the future), social (adherence to corporate norms and values), and psychological (escaping from family problems). Special attention was paid to the analysis of institutional working conditions (organizational characteristics) which can lead to overwork.",Corporate culture; Labor relations; Labor sociology; Office workers; Overwork; Overwork motives; Overwork perception,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014459648

As a result, the Russian funeral industry is highly stigmatized. Why does such a situation exist? Can we assume that stigma is perpetuated by the professional community?

First, that the Russian funeral market has a number of distinctive features: a weak and even spontaneous institutionalization; the prevalence of informal practices; and a dysfunctional infrastructure. In addition, the professional structure is quite closed to the entrance of new players and hierarchically organized according to the principles of a criminal society. This structure can be described in terms of David Stark's concept of ambiguity, meaning that the funeral market is able to function effectively only if its ambiguous status is preserved.

The theoretical basis of the overview is rooted in the cultural and social history of consumer credit-a new and interdisciplinary direction. Because a distinct emphasis is placed on the differences between forms of crediting in certain countries and historical periods, the cultural and social history of credit appears to be the most appropriate for considering forms of consumer credit as they change throughout history. It also focuses on the history of credit institutional conditions that shaped current forms of crediting. The conditions include legislation regulating debt relations more or less rigorously and forms of credit that have already existed, such as pawnshops, small loans, installment credits, family loans, and open-book credits. Furthermore, the development of consumer credit in the USA and in Europe is analyzed. In the USA, the key processes have been the legalization and legitimation of small loans, the proliferation of installment purchases, and the evolution of credit accounting, whereas in Europe, check credit systems (particularly that which was realized in the United Kingdom by the Provident Clothing and Supply Company) that have no analogues in America are of major interest. Then, the criticisms of credit are taken into account as they appeared throughout its development. The main directions of the counteractions were ethical, anti-capitalist, and anti-American criticism. In the conclusion, it is indicated that research in the history of credit is relevant to both the economists and sociologists in the field and to improving our understanding of the complexity and ambiguity of the various factors that have shaped what we now know as consumer crediting.",Check credit systems; Community; Consumer credit; Credit accounting; Cultural history; Financial companies; History of credit; Social history,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014429545

It is based on the extensive ethnographic data collected by the author and his colleagues during 20th century. As a theoretical schema Gudeman offers a model of the five institutional spheres: house, community, commerce, finance and meta-finance, in which the combination of the last three characterizes the state of modern capitalism. These spheres, on the one hand, represent a historical sequence that reflects changes in the speed, quantity and level of abstraction in economic transactions. On the other hand, the economic spheres are interdependent and exist simultaneously in close cooperation and conflict. Collaboration works through various linking mechanisms such as rent, barter, money, etc., and conflicts manifest themselves when two sides of the economic life - empathy and competition - confront each other. According to Gudeman, the feature of modern market capitalism is the unrestrained growth of rents. Rents give the banks, manufacturers, sellers of goods and services non-competitive benefits, which are covered by the rhetoric of competition and displace empathy as an important part of economic life. This imbalance creates inequality for household and community as the least protected participants in economic relations. A field anthropologist, Gudeman demonstrates the commitment to disciplinary traditions to advocate and represent the groups under study. For him, these groups are not ethnic, religious or subcultural, but all people living in the mundane rules of the first two economic spheres. Although the measures that Gudeman proposes to restore the balance of self-interest and mutuality can hardly be discussed and certainly won't be implemented by governments, the book represents an important contribution to the anthropological critique of modern capitalism.",Economic anthropology; Inequality; Mutuality; Rent; Self-interest; Spheres of economy; Thrift,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014423207

More often the effects of congruency are discovered (increase in effectiveness of processing information, which emotional coloring corresponds to emotional states or traits) and complementarity (increase in effectiveness of processing information, opposite in emotional coloring to states or traits). The objective of the present study was to identify the relation between emotional states and personal traits and speed of processing of verbal and non-verbal emotional information of various categories: sadness, fear, anger, joy, neutral stimuli. It was supposed to discover the effects of congruency both for the personal and the situational variables in relation to emotional stimuli of the corresponding content. Emotional state was measured with the PANAS scale. Questionnaires were used that measure happiness, depression, anxiety and aggressiveness as emotional traits. To measure the effectiveness of processing emotional information a computerized procedure was developed, in which the respondents were asked to assess, whether the presented stimulus was emotional or not. The stimuli were the photos of faces, expressing sadness, joy, fear or anger, as well as words, associated with these emotional categories, and the neutral stimuli. No effects of congruency or complementarity either for emotional states or for emotional traits were found in the general sample. The correlation analysis in the extreme groups with various combinations of expression of emotional states and traits found bidirectional effects (of congruency and complementarity, as well as opposite effects).

One of the strategies that a child can use in multiparty conversations is to decide to whom a message (and a new word) is addressed. The ability to do so may simplify word learning situations by making the learning selective and by reducing the amount of perceived words. In the current experiment we test children's ability to learn a new word from a natural conversation when the communicative context is kept constant and when it is altered by adding a new game partner. We predicted that children will differentially interpret verbal messages containing a new word as addressed to them or to the new person, and this will affect their ability to remember the new word. Children heard a new word in one of two conditions: when a communicative context shared with an adult was kept constant and when it has changed (a new adult joined the conversation). We found that 3-year-olds could learn new words only when the communicative context was constant, but 4-year-olds could learn new words in both conditions.

The results obtained by building a general equilibrium model in a multisector economy producing a differentiated good in n high-tech sectors in which single-product firms compete monopolistically using the same technology. Homogeneous (traditional) sector is characterized by perfect competition. Workers are motivated to find a job in high-tech sectors as wages are higher there. However, they are at risk to remain unemployed. Unemployment persists in equilibrium by labor market imperfections. Wages are set by firms in high-tech sectors as a result of negotiations with employees. It is assumed that individuals are homogeneous consumers with identical preferences that are given the separable utility function of general form. In the paper the conditions are found such that the general equilibrium in the model exists and is unique. The conditions are formulated in terms of the elasticity of substitution S between varieties of the differentiated good which is averaged over all consumers. The equilibrium found is symmetrical with respect to the varieties of differentiated good. The equilibrium variables can be represented as implicit functions which properties are associated elasticity S introduced by the authors. A complete analytical description of the equilibrium variables is possible for known special cases of the utility function of consumers, for example, in the case of degree functions, which are incorrect to describe the response of the economy to changes in the size of the markets. To simplify the implicit function, we introduce a utility function defined by two one-parameter families of hypergeometric functions. One of the families describes the pro-competitive, and the other - anti-competitive response of prices to an increase in the size of the economy. A parameter change of each of the families corresponds to all possible values of the elasticity S. In this sense, the hypergeometric function exhaust natural utility function. It is established that with the increase in the elasticity of substitution between the varieties of the differentiated good the difference between the high-tech and homogeneous sectors is erased. It is shown that in the case of large size of the economy in equilibrium individuals consume a small amount of each product as in the case of degree preferences. This fact allows to approximate the hypergeometric functions by the sum of degree functions in a neighborhood of the equilibrium values of the argument. Thus, the change of degree utility functions by hypergeometric ones approximated by the sum of two power functions, on the one hand, retains all the ability to configure parameters and, on the other hand, allows to describe the effects of change the size of the sectors of the economy.

Financial time series reflect simultaneous activity of a large number of different economic agents. Consequently, one expects that methods of statistical physics and the theory of random processes can be applied to them. In this paper, we provide a statistical analysis of time series of the FOREX currency market. Of particular interest is the comparison of the time series behavior depending on the way time is measured: physical time versus trading time measured in the number of elementary price changes (ticks). The experimentally observed statistics of the time series under consideration (euro-dollar for the first half of 2007 and for 2009 and British pound - dollar for 2007) radically differs depending on the choice of the method of time measurement. When measuring time in ticks, the distribution of price increments can be well described by the normal distribution already on a scale of the order of ten ticks. At the same time, when price increments are measured in real physical time, the distribution of increments continues to differ radically from the normal up to scales of the order of minutes and even hours. To explain this phenomenon, we investigate the statistical properties of elementary increments in price and time. In particular, we show that the distribution of time between ticks for all three time series has a long (1-2 orders of magnitude) power-law tails with exponential cutoff at large times. We obtained approximate expressions for the distributions of waiting times for all three cases. Other statistical characteristics of the time series (the distribution of elementary price changes, pair correlation functions for price increments and for waiting times) demonstrate fairly simple behavior. Thus, it is the anomalously wide distribution of the waiting times that plays the most important role in the deviation of the distribution of increments from the normal. As a result, we discuss the possibility of applying a continuous time random walk (CTRW) model to describe the FOREX time series. © 2017 Ekaterina I. Beloborodova, Mikhail V.

In this work, the problem of an average duration of a random search for one object by another is regarded, depending on various factors on a square field. The problem solution was carried out by holding total experiment with 4 factors and orthogonal plan with 54 lines. Within each line, the initial conditions and the cellular automaton transition rules were simulated and the duration of the search for one object by another was measured. As a result, the regression model of average duration of a random search for an object depending on the four factors considered, specifying the initial positions of two objects, the conditions of their movement and detection is constructed. The most significant factors among the factors considered in the work that determine the average search time are determined. An interpretation is carried out in the problem of random search for an object from the constructed model. The important result of the work is that the qualitative and quantitative influence of initial positions of objects, the size of the lattice and the transition rules on the average duration of search is revealed by means of model obtained. It is shown that the initial neighborhood of objects on the lattice does not guarantee a quick search, if each of them moves. In addition, it is quantitatively estimated how many times the average time of searching for an object can increase or decrease with increasing the speed of the searching object by 1 unit, and also with increasing the field size by 1 unit, with different initial positions of the two objects. The exponential nature of the growth in the number of steps for searching for an object with an increase in the lattice size for other fixed factors is revealed. The conditions for the greatest increase in the average search duration are found: the maximum distance of objects in combination with the immobility of one of them when the field size is changed by 1 unit. (that is, for example, with 4 × 4 at 5 × 5) can increase the average search duration in e1.69 ≈ 5.42. The task presented in the work may be relevant from the point of view of application both in the landmark for ensuring the security of the state, and, for example, in the theory of mass service.

Thus it becomes important to create a favorable environment for the formation of local sustainable economic growth and positive expectations in the business sector. The existing literature in this field focuses on macroeconomic determinants of the entrepreneurial activity and does not investigate the effect of the business cycle on firms' decision making. On the contrary, this paper concentrates on Russian regions and identifies the key business cycle factors shaping the entrepreneurial activity both at the regional and the firm-specific levels. The analysis combines aggregate series on 83 regions in 2005-2014 with microeconomic data provided by ""SPARK-Interfax"". In particular, we considered 200 companies in 4 regions of Russia during 2005-2014. Special attention is paid to testing of research hypotheses concerning dynamics of enterprise activity on various phases of business cycle. The identification strategy is built on panel data analysis, as well as survival analysis. We find that the aggregate entrepreneurial activity responds to changes in the regional economic environment with a lag. Moreover, it shows some acyclicity. On average, firms that were organized during the downward phase of the business cycle are more stable (i.e. have a high survival rate). This can be explained with a stronger financial resistance and their experience of operating under uncertainty. Based on these findings, we formulate policy recommendations. In particular, we propose to develop a regional ""business map"" that would reflect the key features of Russian territories.",Acyclity; Business cycle; Determinants; Econometric modeling; Enterprise; Entrepreneurial activity; Panel data analysis; Russian regions; Stability; Survival analysis,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040337866

Paper demonstrates that in terms of the type of income stratification of mass strata Russia is similar to European countries, but it has two distinguishing characteristics. The first one is a pronounced tendency towards the concentration of the population in the ""median"" group due to the traditional equalizing of the incomes of the mass strata ""on the average"". Second is a very large and growing gap between the ""top"" of society and the rest of Russians, which means a gradual ""thinning"" of the stratum that connects this ""top"" with the mass population. Both these tendencies have been intensifying over the years.

The article underlines the following main problems in the work of public councils: the fragmented legal regulation, and the low public involvement in solving socially significant problems that require active participation of citizens. The article is based on the empirical study conducted in 2015-2016 by the Committee of Public Relations of the Government of Moscow in cooperation with the Public Chamber of Moscow according to the orders of the Russian President given at the plenary session of the Public Chamber on 23.06.2015 in the framework of monitoring the effectiveness of public councils under the executive branch of the Federation subjects. The study of the activities of public councils under the state and local authorities was conducted in the form of a survey, which revealed that the public councils under the executive bodies of Moscow do not pursue a coordinated policy in respect of personnel, functions and regulations, and often perform different and incomparable in scale functions. Based on the research findings, the authors suggest some measures to enhance the effectiveness of public councils, such as unification of legal regulations and working formats, which would improve public awareness of the public councils' activities and of the opportunities of personal involvement in such. However, the raising awareness and increasing interest in the public control should be accompanied by the development of effective mechanisms of involvement in the public control practices. © Orlova I.V., Sokolova T.D., 2016.",Civil society; Legal regulation; Non-governmental organizations; Public awareness; Public control; Public councils; Transparency of state authorities,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038437048

This is caused by destabilization of the ion solvation shell and only happens at the ion radii that correspond to changes of the ion coordination number, which happen with an increase in the ion size. Solvation shell fluctuations are activated which leads to additional ion motion with rearrangement of the shell. A theoretical model of this effect is derived and is shown to be in good agreement with molecular dynamics and experimental data. This result rewrites a long standing picture of ion transport as a function of ion size and introduces a new possibility in the search for highly conductive systems. © 2017 the Owner Societies.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038419284

Students lack life experience, thus, they make moral choices under conflicting media information and sometimes even propaganda of certain values or anti-values concerning family, marriage, and motherhood (paternity). A low level of students' awareness of the main issues in planning and creating a family, giving birth to children, taking care of their health is accompanied by an early start of active and risky sexual life. Despite the unconditional authority and positive example of parents, most young people independently search for information about sexual relations and sometimes get negative and painful experience. There are three types of young people: (1) the majority respect traditional family values, try (or wish) to follow them and to some extent succeed; (2) a significant part respect traditional family values but cannot or do not want to follow them (including approving and practicing cohabitation); (3) about a tenth do not respect and do not follow traditional values concerning marriage and family, refuse and oppose them; marriage does not matter for such students, they have no desire to give birth and raise a child, do not think about the morality of relationships between sexes, polygamy, abandonment of the child or abortion. Students indicate factors influencing their family plans and reproductive behavior: social-psychological (own beliefs, opinion of the closest people, limitation of the time resource; unplanned pregnancy and perception of abortion; availability and quality of the partner; social-psychological maturity; perceptions of the future - confidence in it); religiosity; experience (example of the parents' family); social-demographic (age; structure of the parents' family); economic (availability and quality of housing; financial situation); physical (health status); institutional (state family policy, influence of the church and media, values and traditions of society). Thus, the young people reproductive attitudes and the idea of a family are determined by various factors including values and traditions of the closest social circle and society in general. © I.B.

The study is based on two types of data gathered 2012-2015: (1) a sample of semi-structured interviews with professional and managerial staff carried out in 34 artistic institutions, and (2) ego-network data describing professional contacts of managers and art curators. First, we engage with the existing discussion on the structures and formation of organizational fields with special emphasis on studies focusing on artistic institutions. We then describe the population of artistic institutions that emerged in the 2000s, and discuss the transformation of their organizational forms and the emergence of the economic niches occupied by old and new institutions. We map inter-organizational links using the tools of social network analysis to check if new art institutions constitute a cohesive group, and study how this group is connected to other subpopulations in the field. Finally, we analyze the professional ideologies which are used by players in the field to find out if the new organizations possess the institutional legitimacy necessary for their survival and development via the acquisition of resources. The analysis reveals that the new subpopulation of artistic institutions emerged in the early 2000s as a result of grass-root initiatives without stable state or private funding. The explicit mission of these organizations is the distribution of contemporary artistic production. These new institutions are particularly characterized by a combination of different artistic (exhibitions, performances, film screening), academic (lectures and seminars) and commercial (café and shops) activities within a single public space, and by their reliance on private, rather than public funding. The number of these new artistic institutions grew in the early 2000s, but this growth was extremely unstable due to the lack of financial resources and legitimacy. Private institutions emerged in the organizational field, in which the rules of the game are still determined largely by old public institutions. Social network mapping also demonstrates that the new private artistic institutions occupy a disadvantageous position in the network structure of cultural organizations. Old public cultural organizations receive funding through state programs, and their symbolic dominance is ensured by state and educational institutions. As a result, they are more capable of securing private funding as well, since sponsors prefer supporting legitimate art and legitimate cultural activities.",Cultural production; Institutional legitimacy; Inter-organizational network; Organizational population; Sociology of art,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037551475

The principal feature of this technique is that unlike classical tensile testing it allows one to obtain stress-strain curves for a material formed in biaxial tension conditions produced by free bulging process. These conditions are much closer to the ones that the material undergoes during the superplastic forming process. Consequently, they give more accurate information about the material behaviour than the ones coming from tensile tests data. The drawback is that the strain (and similarly its time derivative) cannot be directly measured and controlled during free bulging test but its value has to be derived from other macroscopic measurement. Towards this end, a blow forming machine was equipped with a position transducer for the measurement of the dome height during the test. In order to control the stress in the dome apex at a predetermined level the applied pressure was continuously adjusted to current dome height using a special algorithm. After the test, the dome height data were processed to obtain the evolution of stress, strain and strain rate at the dome apex as well as the stress strain curves for constant referenced strain rates. The tests were performed on superplastic aluminium alloy (ALNOVI-U) sheets of 1.35 mm initial thickness at 500°C. Using the data from two tests with different strain rate paths the stress-strain curves and the strain rate sensitivity index evolution were calculated for two constant referenced strain rates. The obtained constitutive data were verified by finite element simulation of a blow forming. © 2017 The Authors.

Severity of the recent global financial crisis uncovered a series of deficiencies in traditional (microprudential) regulation. This triggered a broader and advanced understanding of the regulatory framework while putting on the agenda priorities of interrelationships between micro-And macro-levels. In fact, microprudential regulation lacks reliable tools that would address key determinants known for their contribution to financial instability including interconnectedness of systemically important banks, deficiencies of their stress resilience to adverse externalities, and systemic risks that undermine soundness of the financial system. Any of the above stress factors taken in isolation may incite crises, probability of which, however, could be reduced by instruments that link key performance indicators of the banking sector with macrolevel dynamics. Although the concept of macroprudential approach in regulation is yet to be finalized, its instruments has already proved their validity and efficiency in navigating regulators with higher accuracy of capital adequacy measurement over the extended time horizon, coping with the excessively increasing assets, limiting credit appetites of banks, and ensuring countercyclicality of banking performance thus smoothening financial cycles. Unlike traditional regulation, the macroprudential domain provides more insights (however, still to a limited extent) into how to balance among the objectives of the post-crisis regulatory paradigm - banking sector dynamics, sustainable economic growth, and financial stability, which all together appear to be a trilemma of the global financial environment. It is believed that further operationalization of macroprudential regulation will add more consistency to national regulatory regimes that will give rise to further internationalization of the Basel Accords including standards and recommendations of Basel III. Despite promising perspectives for minimization of exogenous and endogenous risks in the banking industry, macroprudential mechanism is yet to find fine-Tuned analytical tools that would quantify elements that are critical for the settlement of the regulatory 'trilemma' aiming at enhanced sustainability of international financial intermediation amid souring macro-level parameters and market pessimism. Besides, international regulators are still in search for the unbiased and rigor criteria of macroprudential institutional framework. Even though central banks are currently the place for macroprudential policy and supervision, the latter demands more rational grouping of, and customized approach for, its functions and responsibilities. This ensued from the specifics of macroprudential policy actions that may ultimately compromise independence of the central bank's monetary policy, especially in the framework of inflation targeting, and impair financial cycle elasticity. Importance of the institutional design is also urged by closer synchronization of macroprudential policy with other areas of macro-financial management and supervision. This stands in line with macroprudentialism as a driving force of crisis mitigation. However, missing the acceptable macroprudential standards (in addition to instruments) will be seriously affecting shaping the integrated mechanism of banking regulation eligible for the objectives of post-crisis recovery.",Banks stress resilience; Basel III; Financial stability; Macroprudential regulation; Microprudential regulation; Monetary policy; Post-crisis recovery; Systemic risks,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034618838

The first group talks about “Islamic reformation” as a positive political program, while the second connects it exclusively with the negative phenomenon of Islamic radicalism. The third group does not engage in polemics about “Islamic reformation,” but rather consistently seeks to prove the concept’s inadequacy in explaining Islamic realities and to offer alternative research models.

In this paper we explore this issue empirically with the Russian and European census data and data from the Trajectories in Education and Careers (TREC), a longitudinal cohort study. According to the 2010 census, only 34% of people aged between 25 and 34 in Russia have university degrees, which is nearly the same as in most Eastern European countries and slightly fewer than in Western Europe. The TREC data show that only about 50% of 2012 ninthgrade graduates were university students in 2015. The expansion of higher education in Russia has been in line with the overall European trends. Similar to other countries, there have been changes to the gender composition of university students in Russia over the last two decades, with girls being more likely to attend university than boys. The analysis of social backgrounds of students with different educational trajectories reveals a considerable social inequality within the Russian education system. Eighty-four percent of school graduates with university-educated parents are admitted to university, as compared to only 32% of children from less-educated families. Graduation from ninth grade represents an educational fork that is crucial for inequality, as children from less socially advantaged families tend to opt for vocational education at this stage. Graduation from eleventh grade is a less important educational transition: at least 80% of high school students get admitted to university after graduating from 11th grade.",Education transition; Educational inequality; Higher education; Longitudinal study,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031108934

First, we use factor analysis to study the key features of their innovative behavior: different innovation types and different features of demand for KIBS from innovative clients (volume, range and level of customization of services). Three factors emerge and the KIBS companies are divided into six clusters through the prism of these factors. The clusters are: non-innovators; organizational change innovators; marketing innovators; technology-oriented innovators; non-technological innovators and diversified innovators.

This increases the asymmetry of information concerning the capabilities of the emerging businesses for potential investors, and thus hinders the development of entrepreneurship as a whole. The paper considers the key determinants affecting the decisions made by entrepreneurial start-ups when choosing from a number of ways to finance their business in transitional economies. An attempt has been made to build models for an adequate prediction of the financial strategies of early entrepreneurs. A number of hypotheses have been put forward to verify external and internal factors influencing the financial choices of early entrepreneurs. Hypotheses were tested on a survey sample of early entrepreneurs from seven transitional economies, Our findings confirm that the combinations of external and internal financing differ significantly depending on the national macroeconomic and social context. Given that simple borrowing mechanisms for supporting a business can lead to an undesirable tendency to avoid formal borrowed funds altogether, such behavior can hinder the development of entrepreneurship. The obtained results show that pessimistic short-term expectations about the conditions for entrepreneurship in a region aggravate this problem in Russia. The outcomes demonstrate a need to reduce the burden on start-up businesses and to improve entrepreneurial aspirations by encouraging confidence in a start-up's future and find the optimal proportion of borrowed sources in a business's capital structure.",Borrowed funds; Cross-country comparisons; Early entrepreneurs; Entrepreneurial activity; Financial choice factors; Fisher's linear discriminant; Love capital,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030977356

The author of this article begins with a rather paradoxical statement that this key concept remained without either a strict definition or a detailed elaboration in Weber's sociology. He demonstrates the importance of life for Weber's scientific research program, putting it into the complex context of the intellectual history at the turn of the century where the German Neo-Kantianism of the Baden School, philosophical anthropology, and the philosophy of life played significant roles. He continues with the reconstruction of the functional place of Lebensführung among the analytical tools Max Weber applied in his studies of Western rationalization, understood as a process of the total disenchantment of the world. Müller distinguishes between three main aspects of the rationalization of life in the situation of Modernity: the scientific-technological, the metaphysicallyethical, and the practical forms of modern rationality. He points to the poly-semantical meaning of Lebensführung, while, at the same time, noticing that there is no special attention paid to the concept in current studies of the forms and styles of life. After a concise analysis of similar problems, he in turn formulates ten different forms of Lebensführung in the globalized world, proper to the people in Western countries. These forms are related to trans-nationality, laborization, flexibilization, project-based activity, acceleration, instability, creativity, social control, digitalization, and reflexivity. In conclusion, from his analysis, he draws far-reaching consequences regarding the heuristic capacity and operationalization opportunities of Max Weber's concepts. © Centre for Fundamental Sociology, 2017.",Intellectual history; Life conduct; Life styles; Max Weber; Modernity; Rationality,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030559425

The crucial classical sociological concepts of moral conscience by Herbert Spencer and Emile Durkheim are analyzed in a comparative perspective as examples of utilitarian and social realist solutions to the problem of social order. In addition, the author discusses some more recent approaches to studying moral conscience that are related to the social psychological tradition, which is heavily based on classical studies of moral development by L. Kohlberg. It is shown that, despite its inherent shortcomings and limitations, Kohlberg's theory formed the methodological basis for contemporary moral psychology, which in itself is a distinct field which studies the mechanisms of making moral judgments and evaluations. The predominant approach in the interdisciplinary science of morality, which would be experiments aimed at examining singular moral judgments, is criticized based on the distinction between ""thin"" and ""thick"" morality proposed by G. Abend. Also considered are some modern attempts to rekindle interest in studying morale and moral conscience within sociological theory, as well as the so called ""sociology of morality"", said attempts being of both descriptive and prescriptive nature.

Measuring demand for preschools, in particular unsatisfied demand is of high importance for public policy, but it is a challenging task due to the traditional identification problem: only a joint outcome of demand and supply is observed but not the demand itself. This problem is particularly severe in the Russian case where supply of slots in preschools is rationed and prices are regulated by state. To overcome this problem we employ an approach first proposed by Poirier (1980) and estimate a joint system of demand and supply equations as a partial observability model. Our results confirm a widespread view about the strong deficit of slots in preschools in Russia. We find that almost 80% all mothers with children of age 0-7 are willing to use preschools, but almost half of them are not able to do that due to the limited supply. At the same time, we show that there is a non-negligible group of households which potentially might use preschools but don't do that. This indicates that a more effective redistribution of resources within the Russian public preschool system could lead to a higher enrollment. We also find that the amount of unsatisfied demand among non-employed mothers is higher than among the employed ones, which suggests that raising the availability of preschools could stimulate labor force participation of Russian women.",Preschool education; Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026467886

Recent studies in the humanities and the social sciences have renewed discussions about the flâneur and the urban phenomenon of the flânerie. The roles of the flâneur in a contemporary city are described with the help of the two criteria: the degree of involvement of the flâneur in the urban environment and her capacity to transform the meaning of urban space. According to these criteria, we can distinguish the flâneurs who are active researchers of the city and those who participate in political activities. On the other side, there are more passive observers of the city life and consumers who aimlessly walk in postmodern shopping malls. The aim of the article is to analyze the evolution of theories of the flânerie and introduce an alternative approach to the concept.

More and more companies from developing and transition economies are starting to do business beyond their national borders. Not all of them strictly belong to the category of MNEs, as is the case for Russia's largest companies. This article analyzes the international activities of Russian MNEs. The authors study the place of MNEs in the modern world and examine the transformation of the concept of an MNE in the international practice. They identify the internationally accepted criteria that classify a company as an MNE. They analyze the international activities of the largest Russian companies in the oil and gas sector (Gazprom, Rosneft, Lukoil, Surgutneftegas, Novatek) and their possible classification as MNEs. The article also assesses the influence of the economic and political sanctions on the international activities of Russian MNEs in the oil and gas sector. The methodological basis for the study is the dialectical method of investigating phenomena and processes in the modern world as the most effective way to achieve goals. The authors pay particular attention to the practical application of comparative economic analysis, classification and empirical generalization of original data. The authors came to seven conclusions. First, there is no single approach to defining the essence of MNEs. Second, the indicators that classify a company as an MNE can be divided into qualitative and quantitative criteria. Third, not all the large companies in Russia engaged in expanding into foreign markets can be classified as MNEs by the formal criteria. Fourth, most Russian MNEs have an unstable position in international ratings of MNEs, with the exception of Lukoil. Fifth, the main problems of Russian MNEs include the inefficiency of foreign assets, the lack of experience in managing international holdings and the longstanding crisis of the Russian economy. Sixth, political and economic sanctions severely restrict the business relationship between Russian companies (particularly oil and gas companies) and key international partners, which leads to decreased investment, disrupted implementation of many major projects plans and the decline of companies' financial performance. Seventh, the current situation should spur Russian companies to adapt their economic policies to the new economic realities, to restore full technological and financial chains via expanding business relationships with companies in developing countries, using private sector resources and government support.",Gazprom; Lukoil; Multinational enterprises (MNEs); Novatek; Oil and gas sector; Rosneft; Russian companies; Sanctions; Surgutneftegaz; Transnationality index (TNI); Transnationalization; United Nations; United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021317708

In Russia, the prevalence of diabetes continues to increase with the growing diabetes epidemic. In recent years, the paradigm of diabetes treatment has been changing, with patients increasingly becoming equal participants in the treatment process, through the introduction of self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG). Several clinical studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between SMBG and the decline of the epidemiological and economic burden of diabetes. At present, the procurement of public funds for SMBG is below the specified level in Russia. Aims. To investigate the potential macroeconomic benefits of public health resource allocation and the use of planned state investments to fund SMBG in insulin-treated diabetic patients. Materials and methods. This study was conducted with data from insulin-treated diabetic patients. The epidemiological burden of this cohort was determined by the following indicators: the number of patients and the incidence of complications resulting from diabetes, disability, mortality, age and sex. The economic benefits were evaluated by the implementation of two measures: (1) procurement of public funds for the purchase of means for SMBG in patients with insulin-treated diabetes and (2) the use of highly accurate blood glucose metres. To evaluate economic burden, the epidemiological burden was translated into monetary terms using cost-of-illness. Economic benefits were defined as reductions in economic burden. Results. The economic benefits of public-funded blood glucose test strips for insulin-treated diabetic patients exceeded the required additional investments for their purchase by 1.5 fold. A significant reduction in the inaccuracy of blood glucose metres from 20% to 10% may reduce the economic burden by 9.36 billion RUB. The combined state benefits from the implementation of both measures would significantly decrease the economic burden of diabetes to 29.2 billion RUB. Conclusions. Increased procurement of public funds for SMBG in insulin-treated diabetic patients would bring economic benefits that far exceed the required investments. © Russian Association of Endocrinologists, 2017.",Economic benefits; Self-control; The burden of diabetes,glucose; insulin; age; Article; blood glucose meter; blood glucose monitoring; cohort analysis; cost of illness; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disability; economic benefit; funding; gender; health care delivery; health care utilization; health economics; human; incidence; mortality; Russian Federation; self monitoring; self monitoring blood glucose,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020869743

The existing evidence pertains mainly to the northern, western, and southern regions of the continent, while less is known about the fertility of migrants who have moved between the countries of Eastern Europe. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to examine the fertility patterns of first- and second-generation Russians in Estonia, relative to the sending and host populations. METHODS The study draws on the Estonian and Russian Generations and Gender Surveys. Proportional hazards models are estimated for the transitions to first, second, and third births. RESULTS Russian migrants in Estonia exhibit greater similarity to the sending population, with a lower propensity for having a second and third birth than the host population. This pattern extends to the descendants of migrants. However, mixed Estonian-Russian parentage, enrolment in Estonian-language schools, and residence among the host population are associated with the convergence of Russians' childbearing behaviour with the host-country patterns. The findings support the cultural maintenance and adaptation perspectives; selectivity was found to be less important. CONTRIBUTION The study focuses on a previously under-researched context and underscores the importance of contextual factors in shaping migrants' fertility patterns. It raises the possibility that, depending on the childbearing trends and levels among the sending and receiving populations, large-scale migration may reduce rather than increase aggregate fertility in the host country. With the advancement of the fertility transition in sending countries, this situation may become more common in Europe in the future. © 2017 Puur, Rahnu, Abuladze, Sakkeus & Zakharov.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018483301

However, the text turned into a brief overview and even an attempt to ""classify"" the works which every sociologist focused on textual analysis should read. Such a change of the author's intention was determined by three factors. The first is the ""methodological trauma"" of sociologists who constantly clarify the grounds of their empirical work and conceptualizations under the nowadays-exalted interdisciplinarity of sociology. The second factor is the aggravation of this problem in the field of textual analysis which lacks conventional nominations of analytical approaches, not to mention rules and procedures of the ""classical"" scientific methodology. The third factor responsible for the change in the author's intention is the need for some minimum competence in the disciplines that influence textual analysis in sociology and, thus, their impact has to be evaluated in terms of their causes, consequences, and limits. The author identifies four types of non-sociological works on different linguistic aspects of social life that can form such a competence: (1) practical guidelines for the linguistic analysis essential for correct content analytical studies; (2) publicist estimates of the role of language in social life and of the transformations of the current Russian language/discourse; (3) philosophical works devoted not as much to the discursive construction of social reality as to the fundamental role of language in its constitution and destruction, and; (4) works on the social life of texts that can conditionally fit into the notion of the ""sociology of literature"".","Discursive construction of reality; Interdisciplinarity; Linguistic analysis; Non-sociological types of works on ""the problem of text""; Social life of texts; Textual analysis in sociology; The social role of language",,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017278690

Which properties of a word are processed parafoveally (that is, before the eyes actually move to it) and how this information is used are among the least understood questions in reading studies. The authors' goal was to test the length constraint hypothesis (LCH) according to which parafoveally obtained information about word length is used for word recognition, namely, to constrain the set of possible lexical candidates for the word to be recognized. Opponents of the LCH assume that this information is important only to determine where to direct our eyes during the next saccade: the preferred landing position for word processing is slightly to the left of the center. The results of the previous experiments testing this hypothesis are controversial. In this paper, the authors address several problems identified in earlier studies in an eye-tracking experiment on Russian. 24 adult Russian speakers participated in the experiment. The authors used the gaze-contingent boundary paradigm. This method involves eye-tracking while participants are reading sentences. Before the reader's eyes cross a particular point in front of the target word (so-called invisible boundary), another word or pseudoword (a preview) is shown on the screen. The preview is replaced by the target word while the eyes are moving across this boundary. Visual information processing is suppressed during saccades, so the actual change is not noticed, but its effects can be measured. There were 48 target sentences in three conditions: previews of the same length as targets, longer previews (in both cases, previews were orthographically similar to targets) and previews identical to targets. In the second condition, previews were only two letters longer than targets to minimize the difference between landing positions in this condition and two other ones. The data about eye movements were collected using an SR Eyelink 1000 plus eye tracker system. Statistical analysis using linear-mixed modeling revealed significant effects of length in the eyetracking measures reflecting early processing stages: the first fixation duration, single fixation duration and gaze duration were longer in the longer-preview condition than in the same-length condition. Most previous studies used pseudowords as previews, while the authors used real words, which could make the length effect more pronounced. To make sure that this result was not due to a non-optimal landing position (if the lengths of the preview and the target differ, the eyes may be directed to a non-optimal viewing position in the target), the authors included initial landing position to the model as a covariate. Hence, the authors concluded that their findings support the LCH: the readers obtain the information about word length parafoveally and use this information not only to plan the next eye movement, but also for word recognition.",Boundary paradigm; Eye tracking; Length constraint hypothesis; Parafoveal processing; Reading; Word length,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017262643

It first appeared in monolingual dictionaries in the mid-19th century. At this stage, the word had two main meanings: 'a sacred narrative, tradition of a sacred event, related to the Church' and 'an oral tradition of a miraculous event' (Dahl's dictionary), the latter being more frequently used. By the early 20th century the word had developed several meanings, both commonly used ('fiction') and terminological ones ('musical piece', 'inscription on a medal'). The dictionaries of the 20th century, starting with Ushakov's dictionary, reveal a structural transformation in the word definition which resulted from the change in the hierarchy of meanings: the word's religious context weakened, and the terminological meaning 'poetical tale' started to predominate. In the second half of the 20th century the word acquired new meanings: 'a spy's fictitious biography', and the existing meanings 'stereotypical idea of somebody' and 'a famous person' continued to be actively used. In the early 21st century the word began to occur in the spheres very different from the initial ones - in marketing and advertising. The analysis demonstrates some discrepancy between the word's lexicographic representation and its actual usage revealed in the Corpus. For example, the dictionaries fail to mention some meanings and construe the meanings hierarchy in a different manner. The analysis also indicates a significant influence of ideology upon dictionary entries, which is partly due to the word's semantics allowing to highlight either the verisimilitude (Ozhegov's dictionary) or the inauthenticity (Ushakov's dictionary) of the narrative. The Corpus data shows that the frequency of meaning usage depends much on extralinguistic factors. The word legend started to be used with the meaning 'a famous person' considerably more often in the second half of the 20th century, which may be attributed to the mass media role. Meanwhile, the usage of the meaning 'oral tradition' gradually decreases. The undertaken research of the lexeme legend demonstrates the impact which extralinguistic and linguistic factors have on the word's entering a language, developing and losing some meanings, and the way these processes are reflected in explanatory dictionaries.",Corpus; Ideology; Lexeme; Lexicography; Meaning,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017255510

A model of sports development was built using PLS-SEM method. We identified the following latent variables: economic development of the region; funds allocated to sports development; availability of resources; development of mass sports; development level of professional sports; results in elite sports, results in adaptive sports. The level of regional economic development affects the amount of funding allocated to the sports, which in turn determines the availability of resources. Availability of resources affects the success in the development of mass and professional sports. Success in professional sports determines results in great sporting achievements and adaptive sports. Structural modelling allowed us to identify measurable indicators of resources (model inputs) and results of sports development (model outputs). The authors assessed the effectiveness of transformation of inputs into outputs using DEA method. We investigated two models. The first one uses the indicators of mass sports development as outputs, the second one uses the indictors of professional sports development as outputs. The inputs of both models are the indicators of financial resources for sports. The simultaneous review of the effectiveness of two directions allows to emphasize the features of each region and evaluate balance in the development of mass and professional sports.

In this case the elliptic Keplerian motion of the satellite/the spacecraft tight group mass center is predefined. The attitude motion of the system does not influence its orbital motion. The principal central axes of inertia are assumed to move as a rigid body. Simultaneously masses of the body can redistribute in a way such that the values of moments of inertia can change. Thus, all configurations can perform pulsing motions changing it own dimensions. One obtains a system of equations of motion for such a compound satellite. It turns out that the resulting system of equations is similar to the well-known equation of V.V.Beletsky for the satellite in elliptic orbit planar oscillations. We use true anomaly as an independent variable as it is in the Beletsky equation. It turned out that there are planar pendulum-like librations of the whole system which may be regarded as perturbations of the mathematical pendulum. One can introduce action-Angle variables in this case and can construct the dynamics of mappings over the non-Autonomous perturbation period. As a result, one is able to apply the well-known Moser theorem on an invariant curve for twisting maps of annulus. After that one can get a general picture of motion in the case of the system planar oscillations. So, the whole description in the paper splits into two topics: (a) general dynamical analysis of the satellite planar attitude motion using KAM theory; (b) construction of periodic solutions families depending on the perturbation parameter and rising from equilibrium as the perturbation value grows. The latter families depend on the parameter of the perturbation and are absent in the non-perturbed problem.",Action-Angle variables; Analytical developments; KAM theory; Moser theorem on invariant curve; Periodic solutions,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039049227

The empirical tests we perform generally support this hypothesis, but they also identify certain limits for such an explanation. Our tests reveal for low and middle income countries a statistically significant correlation between GDP per capita and the economic inequality levels, but this correlation is not particularly strong. Earlier we found for the same countries significantly stronger positive correlations between GDP per capita and some important components of sociopolitical destabilization, such as the intensity of political assassinations, general strikes and anti-government demonstrations. It is quite clear that the strong association between the increase in the intensity of these components of sociopolitical destabilization and GDP per capita growth, can be explained by a much weaker tendency toward the growth of economic inequality only partly. In addition, our empirical tests suggest the presence of a certain threshold level of about 40 points on the Gini scale, after crossing which one can expect a radical increase in levels of sociopolitical destabilization in general, and the intensity of terrorist acts / guerrilla warfare and anti-government demonstrations in particular. According to the World Bank, the value of the Gini coefficient for Russia is now just in this zone, which suggests that the further growth of inequality in Russia could lead to an abrupt increase in political destabilization. © Centre for Fundamental Sociology, 2017.",CNTS destabilization indices; Economic development; GDP per capita; Inequality; Political instability; Sociopolitical destabilization,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030540933

The balls are assumed intersecting each other. Their radii can be unequal. An approximate expression for the potential of attraction is deduced. Within an assumption on uniform rotation of the dumb-bell about its central axis of inertia differing from the axis of symmetry positions of relative equilibria of the massive particle (libration points) are investigated. As is known, there exist celestial bodies, seeming composed by large lobes, somehow connected or penetrating one into another. Evident irregularity in their mass distribution implies difficulties in description of gravitational fields using classical approach, based on utilization of spherical harmonics (cf.[1]). Extending another approach, based on utilization of single dumb-bells [2,3] or triangles with masses, concentrated in vertexes [4-7], we discuss a possibility of exploitation of real and complexified dumb-bells for description of Newtonian attraction. For some examples, existence, stability and bifurcations of uniformly rotating stationary configurations of such bodies and massive points under mutual attraction were studied without assumptions on a mass ratio of the gravitating bodies. This means, that the results cover not only the case, when the body is much more massive than the point, but also the case when two masses are comparable, as well as the case, when the point is considerably more massive than the body. In the latter case the body with irregular mass distribution orbites about a massive immobile primary. © 2017 The Authors.

The economies of developing countries will continue their slowdown due to lower prices of raw commodities and the increased pressure of dollar debt load.

Then we expect the start of a new acceleration of global economic growth at the upswing phase of the 6th Kondratieff cycle (2018-2050). This upswing will be driven by the development of the 6th technological paradigm whose core is being created by the NBIC-convergence (that is the convergence of nano-, bio-, information, and cognitive technologies). A speedy and steady withdrawal from the third phase of the global financial crisis requires cooperative action between developed and developing countries within G20 to stimulate global demand, world trade and a fair solution of the debt problem of developing countries. On the other hand, the governments of the technologically advanced countries should concentrate resources and efforts on the stimulation of the practical application of the NBICtechnologies because they form the core of the 6th technological paradigm and a new structure of the world economy.

Under the gain of a debtor we understand reduction of the NPV of the future debt payments after the restructuring, and the increase of payments we treat as a loss. The opposite is true for the banks. We show that Rusal and Mechel gained from the restructuring, while Evraz and TMK had to pay for it. With the help of hindsight analysis, we came to the conclusion that the choice of creditors must be explained by the financial status of the debtors. Those companies that could pay for the restructuring paid for it, and those that could not service the debt on the initial terms got significant debt reliefs. Both companies that had extracted debt reductions from their creditors went through the debt restructuring again a few years later, and Mechel would probably need a third one. Thus, we showed that in the course of the debt restructuring the creditors acted rationally. In the course of our analysis, we also came to an additional conclusion that the creditors had not used Altman's Z-score, presumably, due to possessing more precise instruments of estimating the probability of the debtors' bankruptcy.

To the contributors knowledge, the bibliometric analysis is applied for the first time on client satisfaction, so this is also a novel aspect of the paper to highlight. © Veronika Rudchenko, Juan-Carlos Martín, María-Victoria Sánchez-Rebull, 2017.",Analytical approach.; Client satisfaction; Literature review,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020117106

We conducted a series of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) tests of the factorial structure and the configural, metric, scalar, factor variance, factor covariance, and factor means invariances of the model across gender and age groups. The validity of the Russian version of the UWES-9 was investigated by studying its relationship with burnout, job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention. The CFA showed that both the 1-factor and the 3-factor models of the UWES-9 fit well with the data, but the 3-factor model demonstrates a significantly better fit. However, the differences are minor, therefore, in practical terms, the models are identical. Thus the Russian version of the UWES-9 can be used both as a three-scale measurement and as a single scale of work engagement. Results from the multi-group CFA provided evidence of factorial invariance of the 3-factor model across gender and age groups. Internal consistencies of the vigor, dedication, and absorption subscales are acceptable. The results also suggested the convergent, discriminant, and incremental validity of the UWES-9, as shown by its relationship with burnout, job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and turnover intention. The article also discusses the differences in levels of work engagement within different gender and age groups. Overall, the results show that the Russian version of the UWES-9 demonstrates acceptable psychometric properties comparable with the original version and those in other languages. The Russian version of the UWES-9 can therefore be recommended for use in research and practice. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2017.",Burnout; Measurement; Positive organizational behavior; UWES; Work engagement,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019266155

The analysis of domestic and foreign methodological approaches to the assessment of the damage caused by breaks in an electrical supply allowed to substantiate the structure of a full damage. For this purpose, we propose three groups of techniques. The first method is based on the standard approach. We apply it for a detailed account of the components of damage (real loss, social and economic losses, ecological damage, indirect losses) with reference to the occurred failure. The second technique is based on the use of three groups of typical scenarios of the consequences of an emergency interruption in power supply. These scenarios have resulted from the analysis of the regulation documentation and statistical data on the basic groups of industrial consumers (on the example of gas supply system, these are production facilities, transport, storage, reprocessing and support facilities). The third method is based on the specific indicators of unplanned coasts depending on the size of the disconnected capacity, an interruption duration and the duration of the restoration of electricity. The second and third techniques are developed to forecast the damage and to substantiate the efficiency of measures for improving the reliability of the electrical supply of the industrial consumers. The article includes the results of the assessment of full damage caused by the interruption in the electrical supply through the developed techniques on the example of the gas industry objects. The comparison of the results of the assessment with the real values of damages from the occurred failures would suggest the adequacy of the developed techniques.

The Weberian intellectual tradition at the present stage faces other challenges, the most important of which is the answer to the question whether Max Weber's sociology has sufficient potential to be a reliable theory for diagnosing and forecasting the problems of globalization and modernization, which is apart from the awareness of how modern society has emerged and is being formed. In the second part, critical annotations of reports and publications are presented.

These three issues issues are based on the idea of an atlas meant to map out the intellectual landscape of actor-network theory (ANT) and flat ontologies. Over the course of a few decades of its existence, ANT has evolved from a singular approach in science and technology studies into a transdisciplinary family of theories joined together by a set of basic properties, partial connections, and common references. This article maps out the trajectories of ANT development and reception. Bruno Latour is discussed as one of the main assemblage points of the approach. A one of the founders of the approach, he took part in many of its transformations, as well as in a collective closure and relaunch of the project. However, ""Latour"" is sometimes a name designating a particular intellectual, sometimes denotes the Paris school of ANT, and is sometimes a reference to a network of research projects, or even the whole actor-network approach. His name conceals differences between these four senses and provides permanent shifts from one to another. Latour's changeability draws the attention of critics and readers, generating new interpretations of his work. One classic example is the polemic between Bruno Latour and David Bloor, a leader of the Edinburgh school of sociology of scientific knowledge. Their clash is an important event that largely defined which theoretical style would dominate in the field of science and technology studies. The expansion of ANT across various disciplinary boundaries is discussed in the article through Graham Harman's proposal to rethink Latour theory in philosophy, connecting the actor-network approach with flat ontologies.

According to this hypothesis, lower values of average per capita income tends to lead to increased risks of sociopolitical destabilization (a positive correlation), while a decrease of sociopolitical destabilization risks correlates with higher levels of per capita income (a negative correlation). However, our analysis has shown that this curvilinear relationship can be quite different in some important details for various indices of sociopolitical destabilization, with a very important exception. We show that the relationship between per capita GDP and the intensity of coups and coup attempts is not curvilinear; a particularly strong negative correlation between this index and the logarithm of GDP per capita exists. We demonstrate that this fact makes the bell-shaped relationship considerably less distinct with respect to the integral index of sociopolitical destabilization, and makes a significant contribution to the formation of its asymmetry. Our analysis also shows that the bell-shaped relationship assumed by the Olson-Huntington hypothesis is observed for all other indices of sociopolitical destabilization. In relation to such indices as political strikes, riots, and anti-government demonstrations, we deal with an asymmetry that is directly opposite, since a positive correlation between GDP and instability for poorer countries is much stronger than the negative correlation for richer countries. An especially strong asymmetry of this kind is found for the intensity of anti-government demonstrations.",Anti-government demonstrations; CNTS destabilization indices; Coups; Economic development; GDP per capita; Political development; Political instability; Sociopolitical destabilization,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017248033

To compare mortality parameters in coronary heart disease (CHD) in Russia and USA, and to assess the reasons for differences; to underline the necessity for adequate completion of death certificates. Material and methods. Age-related and standardized mortality coefficients (SMC) for ages older than 50, in Russia and the US, were calculated, that are relevant to three- and four-digit codes of the “International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th”. As a standard for mortality coefficients, the European Standard Population (ECН-2013) was applied. Results. SMC from all types of CHD among men 50 years and older in RF was 2153,1, and in USA 712,6; among women, respectively, 1288,3 and 421,2. The part of deaths from “acute” CHD was 19,5% and 34,2% (males, RF and USA), 14,9% and 34,7% (females, RF and USA). Mortality from myocardial infarction (MI) (ICD-X code I21) in Russia is 1,6 times lower than in the USA, but by the chart “Other forms of acute ischemic heart disease”, I24) mortality in RG among women is 22 times higher, and in men — 35 times. The article discusses such discrepancies. Conclusion. Differences in mortality from CHD in the US and Russia are due to a range of reasons, many of them related to selection of primary cause of death and specifics of ICD-X code selection. © 2017, Silicea-Poligraf.

Varying the field, one can alter the length of the non-adsorbed (bulk) part of the chain and hence the deformation of the target body and the arising force. We focus on the impact of added salt on the magnitude of the generated force, which is especially important for applications. In particular, we develop a simple variational theory for the double layer formed near electrodes to compute the electric field acting on the bulk part of the chain. Our theoretical predictions agree well with the MD simulations. Next, we study the effectiveness of possible PE-based nano-vices, comprised of two clenching planes connected by PEs exposed to an external electric field. We analyze a novel phenomenon-two-dimensional diffusion of a nano-particle, clenched between two planes, and introduce a quantitative criterion for clenching efficiency, the clenching coefficient. It is defined as a logarithm of the ratio of the diffusion coefficients of a free and clenched particle. Using first a microscopic counterpart of the Coulomb friction model, and then a novel microscopic model based on surface phonons, with the vibration direction normal to the surface, we calculate the clenching coefficient as a function of the external electric field. Our results demonstrate a dramatic decrease of the diffusion coefficient of a clenched nano-particle for the range of parameters relevant for applications; this proves the effectiveness of the PE-based nano-vices. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024105975

Thus, up to a certain value of per capita GDP the economic growth tends to lead to an increased risk of sociopolitical destabilization, and only with relatively high values of per capita GDP its further growth tends to lead to a decrease in sociopolitical destabilization risks. Hence, for higher values of per capita GDP we observe a negative correlation between GDP per capita and the risk of social and political instability, and for lower values it is positive. An especially pronounced positive correlation of this sort is found with respect to such an indicator of sociopolitical destabilization, as the intensity of anti-government demonstrations. A very strong (r = 0,935, R2 = 0,875) statistically significant positive correlation between GDP per capita and the intensity of anti-government demonstrations can be seen in a very wide range (up to 20 000 international 2014 dollars at purchasing power parity [PPP]).Apparently, the positive correlation between, on the one hand, per capita GDP, and, on the other hand, the socio-political destabilization in general, and the intensity of anti-government demonstrations in particular, that we observe in the range of up to 20 000 dollars is one of the factors responsible for the existence of so called middle-income trap. The middle-income trap is usually defined as ""the phenomenon of hitherto rapidly growing economies stagnating at middle-income levels and failing to graduate into the ranks of high-income"" (according to S.Aiyar et al.). Indeed, as we see, just when an economy approaches the escape from this trap, the destabilization intensity tends to reach very high values, which could trigger particularly strong upheavals that could throw this or that country back for many years.",Antigovernment demonstrations; Autocracy; Democracy; Democratization; Economic development; GDP per capita; Intermediate political regimes; Middle income trap; Political development; Sociopolitical instability,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016289376

However, existing evidence is inconsistent and may be accounted for by differences in chronotype or time-of-day. We examined the effects of sustained wakefulness over a normal “socially constrained” day (following 18 h of sustained wakefulness), following a night of normal sleep, on visual attention as a function of chronotype. Methods: Twenty-six good sleepers (mean age 25.58; SD 4.26; 54 % male) completed the Attention Network Test (ANT) at two time points (baseline at 8 am; following 18-h sustained wakefulness at 2 am). The ANT provided mean reaction times (RTs), error rates, and the efficiency of three attentional networks—alerting, orienting, and executive control/conflict. The Morningness–Eveningness Questionnaire measured chronotype. Results: Mean RTs were longer at time 2 compared to time 1 for those with increasing eveningness; the opposite was true for morningness. However, those with increasing morningness exhibited longer RT and made more errors, on incongruent trials at time 2 relative to those with increasing eveningness. There were no significant main effects of time or chronotype (or interactions) on attentional network scores. Conclusion: Sustained wakefulness produced differential effects on visual attention as a function of chronotype. Whilst overall our results point to an asynchrony effect, this effect was moderated by flanker type. Participants with increasing eveningness outperformed those with increasing morningness on incongruent trials at time 2. The preservation of executive control in evening-types following sustained wakefulness is likely driven by differences in circadian phase between chronotypes across the day. © 2016, The Author(s).",Attention; Chronotype; Sleep deprivation; Visual attention; Wakefulness,adult; Article; assessment of humans; Attention Network Test; chronobiology; female; human; male; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; priority journal; response time; sleep deprivation; visual attention; wakefulness; adolescent; analysis of variance; association; attention; circadian rhythm; executive function; orientation; physiology; questionnaire; reaction time; time factor; vision; wakefulness; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Attention; Circadian Rhythm; Cues; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Orientation; Reaction Time; Sleep Deprivation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Visual Perception; Wakefulness; Young Adult,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987615815

Each library was transformed into Escherchia coli cells, separated by efficiency of CER mRNA translation by a cell sorter and subjected to next generation sequencing. We tested efficiency of translation of the CER gene preceded by each of 48 natural 5'-UTR sequences and introduced random and designed mutations into natural and artificially selected 5'-UTRs. Several distinct properties could be ascribed to a group of 5'-UTRs most efficient in translation. In addition to known ones, several previously unrecognized features that contribute to the translation enhancement were found, such as low proportion of cytidine residues, multiple SD sequences and AG repeats.

OBJECTIVE This paper presents new mortality information from two Caucasian countries, Georgia and Armenia. Results are compared with information from two relevant countries previously examined in the literature, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. METHODS Using official statistics (with adjustments when necessary), we compare adult mortality patterns in the four countries since 1979, for all causes and by cause for the recent period. For Kyrgyzstan results are presented by ethnicity, as its mortality levels have been impacted by its large Slavic population. RESULTS Adult mortality patterns in Armenia and Georgia have been more favorable than in Russia. This appears to be due to a large extent to lower mortality from alcohol-related causes. Mortality patterns in these Caucasian republics resemble those observed in Kyrgyzstan, especially when considering the native portion of the population. CONCLUSIONS As far as mortality is concerned, Armenia and Georgia have weathered the collapse of the Soviet Union better than Russia.

leading cause of death worldwide. Current estimates on the burden of cancer are needed for cancer control planning. OBJECTIVE: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 32 cancers in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Cancer mortality was estimated using vital registration system data, cancer registry incidence data (transformed to mortality estimates using separately estimated mortality to incidence [MI] ratios), and verbal autopsy data. Cancer incidence was calculated by dividing mortality estimates through the modeled MI ratios. To calculate cancer prevalence, MI ratios were used to model survival. To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Countries were categorized by SDI quintiles to summarize results. FINDINGS: In 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths. Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with population aging contributing 16%, population growth 13%, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the most common cancer globally was prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for women (523 000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (-6.1% [95% uncertainty interval (UI), -10.6% to -1.3%]). The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, further straining limited health care resources. Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and palliative care requires detailed knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study results demonstrate that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major findings also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet.

star coalescence candidate (later designated GW170817) with merger time 12:41:04 UTC was observed through gravitational waves by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor independently detected a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) with a time delay of ~1.7 s with respect to the merger time. From the gravitational-wave signal, the source was initially localized to a sky region of 31 deg2 at a luminosity distance of 40 8 8-+ Mpc and with component masses consistent with neutron stars. The component masses were later measured to be in the range 0.86 to 2.26 M. An extensive observing campaign was launched across the electromagnetic spectrum leading to the discovery of a bright optical transient (SSS17a, now with the IAU identification of AT 2017gfo) in NGC 4993 (at ~40 Mpc) less than 11 hours after the merger by the One-Meter, Two Hemisphere (1M2H) team using the 1 m Swope Telescope. The optical transient was independently detected by multiple teams within an hour. Subsequent observations targeted the object and its environment. Early ultraviolet observations revealed a blue transient that faded within 48 hours. Optical and infrared observations showed a redward evolution over ~10 days. Following early non-detections, X-ray and radio emission were discovered at the transient's position ~9 and ~16 days, respectively, after the merger. Both the X-ray and radio emission likely arise from a physical process that is distinct from the one that generates the UV/optical/near-infrared emission. No ultra-high-energy gamma-rays and no neutrino candidates consistent with the source were found in follow-up searches. These observations support the hypothesis that GW170817 was produced by the merger of two neutron stars in NGC4993 followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) and a kilonova/macronova powered by the radioactive decay of r-process nuclei synthesized in the ejecta. © 2017.

We think of it as an introduction to the topic for scientists specializing in other subfields of statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory, so, for the readers reference, we start with a short review of the equilibrium static properties of polymer systems. Most attention is paid to the dynamics of unentangled polymer systems, where apart from classical Rouse and Zimm models we review some recent scaling and analytical generalizations. The dynamics of systems with entanglements is also briefly reviewed. Special attention is paid to the discussion of comparatively weakly understood topological states of polymer systems and possible approaches to the description of their dynamics. © 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Storchevoy defines four criteria of a good scientific method (clear definitions, correct logic, empirical verification, accurate measurement) and demonstrates how normative ethics can make use of them. He provides a historical review of the methodological evolution of normative ethics and outlines how it was moving in a nonlinear way towards this scientific development by the 16th century. A Scientific Approach to Ethics challenges the reputation of ethics among many within business and business schools as unscientific and argues that it can come to be seen as a scientific discipline able to reveal universal moral truth. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.

Currently it is highly important to be able to detect outliers in data streams, as recent years have seen a rapid growth in the amount of such data. Only a few techniques are applicable to real-time data and even fewer could provide an interpretable anomaly score. Probabilistic interpretation of the anomaly score could allow an analyst to choose the anomaly threshold based on the desired false alarm rate, which is highly important in a number of real-life applications. We propose a modification of the EXPoSE algorithm for anomaly detection in time series data, which produces a probabilistic score of abnormality. The proposed algorithm is developed within the framework of conformal anomaly detection and utilizes the expected similarity as a measure of non-conformity. © 2017 ASSA.",Anomaly detection; Conformal prediction; Expected similarity; Kernel methods; Time series,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040741526

A comparative historical approach is used. Three aspects of these examinations are in focus: ideology or the dominant understanding of its tasks and the ‘mission’; the characteristics of the organisation and regulation of procedures; the practices behind these examinations. The key question is whether this institution, which was established in Soviet times, has undergone modifications given the dramatic changes in the state’s attitude to work and employment since the fall of the USSR. A comparative analysis of the regulations of the USSR and the Russian Federation is provided, as well as an analysis of the content of Soviet and contemporary educational literature for physicians. To determine how sick leave provision was organised in practice in the Soviet era, the archival documents of All-Union Central Soviet of Trade Unions over the period 1930–1980 (transcripts of meetings, reports on results of inspections etc.) were examined. Evaluation of modern practices of the examination is based on thirty-one semi-structured interviews with physicians and the representatives of medical centres management and monitoring bodies. Rather than operating as an means of social protection of the citizens, it makes more sense to view the Soviet-era institution of temporary disability examinations as a tool aiming at the rational distribution of labour resources for optimal use in the national economy. Medical providers could not cope with this task of examination and regarded its procedures and rules formally. However, these procedures and rules have influenced and continue to influence the organisation of professional medical practice and therapeutic process, defining routine interactions between medical institutions and patients.",Medical commission; Medical-labour examination; Public social insurance; Sick leave; Sickness certificate; Soviet healthcare; Temporary disability examination,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039872093

By optimizing the structure of arborescences, our coding scheme can decrease the quantization error considerably, while incurring only minimal overhead on the memory footprint and the speed of nearest neighbor search in the compressed dataset compared to the independent quantization.

However, the correlation between the spatial pattern of different fluorescent proteins reflects important biological functions, and synthesized images have to capture these relationships to be relevant for biological applications. We adapt GANs to the task at hand and propose new models with casual dependencies between image channels that can generate multichannel images, which would be impossible to obtain experimentally. We evaluate our approach using two independent techniques and compare it against sensible baselines. Finally, we demonstrate that by interpolating across the latent space we can mimic the known changes in protein localization that occur through time during the cell cycle, allowing us to predict temporal evolution from static images. © 2017 IEEE.",,Biology; Biosynthesis; Computer vision; Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Proteins; Adversarial networks; Biological applications; Biological functions; Fluorescent protein; Multichannel images; Novel applications; Protein localization; Synthesized images; Image processing,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041915494

It shows the preferential plugging of large pores during mono-sized particle transport, explaining well-posed formulation of pore-size distribution tuning from breakthrough concentrations and retention profiles.

Subjects were asked to identify the antecedent of the pronoun (the nominal group in the preceding sentence to which the pronoun relates) in a situation in which the antecedent of the pronoun could be only one nominal group (the control condition) and in the situation of referential conflict, where there were two such nominal groups (the experimental condition). Perception of referentially ambiguous pronouns, as compared with control pronouns, was accompanied by an Nref effect – a diffuse shift of ERP with latency 300–400 msec towards negative potentials, which has previously been observed in the Dutch and Chinese languages. In contrast to preceding studies, we found no P600 effect – an increase in late positivity, which is associated with additional analysis of the correctness of the sentence in conditions of referential ambiguity. Comparison of these data with results from previous studies provides evidence that the strategy of perceiving ambiguous expressions (assessment of correctness) may depend not only on the task, but also the presence/absence of anomalous trials in the experimental material. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature",event-related potentials; neurolinguistics; referential ambiguity; referential selection; speech perception,brain; event related potential; human; speech perception,English,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037667016

The hyperbolic regime of the metasurfaces manifests in the amplification of the polarization rotation in transmitted light and in the giant enhancement of the effect in reflected light. The transition to this regime is frequency dependent and has a topological nature. The key role in the optical activity enhancement belongs to the σ-near-pole and hyperbolic σ-near-zero regimes of the metasurfaces. The hyperbolic metasurfaces based on graphene strips or metal disks, and a black phosphorus thin film as a natural hyperbolic layer are considered. The efficiency of the predicted effects depends on the metasurface implementation and the role of a substrate. By varying the metasurface parameters and choosing the physical realizations it is possible to design such a hyperbolic metasurface polarizer for the THz, infrared, and visible working ranges.

Thus, Heidegger treats “education” ontologically as the ability to achieve Da-sein as one’s own true and integral being whose Da-sein always takes precedence in understanding. On this basis, we can say that Heidegger treats education as a transcendental ontological structure that he, like Scheler, calls “disclosedness.” And although Heidegger almost never uses the term “education” in his analytic system, preferring instead to use expressions such as “authentic being,” “projection of the self,” etc., all of this content that he invests in this term closely follows Scheler’s interpretation, because it also characterizes human existence as “open” and “not foreordained.” For Scheler, the same “open” existence is an expression of existential human freedom, since it serves to manifest the spirit as the ontological principle. Considered in epistemological and value terms, this freedom, according to Scheler, is what he refers to as “education,” a transcending state of being that is manifested for another thing in existence as something that is “known” by loving participation in it with a view to achieving “one’s authentic self.”. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044758263

Redefining welfare ideology and minimizing the social burden on the state leads to the public and scientific debate about the value of early childhood education and its role in investing in human development. In-depth interviews with 30 mothers were analyzed by coding and category clustering. The results show that parents understand the service provided by a kindergarten as complex, aimed primarily at daytime children’s education and development in a specifically organized educational space performed by professional educators. The greatest parental value is children’s opportunity to be socialized or ""learn how to communicate,"" to resolve conflicts and to find compromises, and to relate their behavior with group-mates and peers followed by the development of life skills, surviving with routines, as well as the associated skill initiative.

It is argued here that early modern court narratives (and their creators) used an environmental approach to emotional management. They focused on the creation of the specific cultural and physical settings to externalize their emotions for successful mediation of their conflicts.

Oxford University Press, Oxford, pp 481–563, 1977/1989; Stalnaker in Synthese 22:272–289, 1970), but how exactly this indexicality is achieved has been a matter of some debate. While not settling the debate, this paper aims to show that there is no single way to become a person indexical. Natural language allows for at least three different representations leading to person indexicality. Evidence for this comes from sentences involving imposters and pronouns coreferent with or bound by them. Particularly telling are cases of variation between third and non-third person pronouns in sentences with imposters, first discussed by Collins and Postal. Constraints on this variation support the view that it is not adequate from either an empirical or an explanatory perspective to treat all person indexicals uniformly. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Imposters; Indexicality; Person features; Semantics of pronouns,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031818321

Firm-level product ranges and the mass of firms are endogenously determined. We show how an increase in market size affects the market outcome.

Theories of meaning, in the sense discussed here, are attempts to explain what makes it the case that certain sounds, shapes, or movements are meaningful linguistic expressions. It is widely believed that Wittgenstein made fundamental contributions to this explanatory project. I argue, by contrast, that in both his early and later works, Wittgenstein endorsed a disjunctivist conception of language which rejects the assumption underlying the question that such theories seek to answer—namely, the assumption that the notion of a meaningful linguistic expression admits of non-circular analysis. Moreover, I give two arguments in favor of the view I ascribe to Wittgenstein: one based on later Wittgenstein's discussion of meaning skepticism and one based on considerations concerning the identity of linguistic expressions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013469014

The focus is on the categories defining the purposes and tasks of higher education in the larger context of society and economy. There is a basic dichotomy in relation to the purposes and role of higher education, between vocational training (which is seen as a determining factor in the economic development) and personal development/education (seen as a condition of social development). The balance of these two poles, economic instrumentalism and social instrumentalism, changes throughout the history. The Soviet documents emphasized the importance of both, with the predominance of the social instrumentalism. The transitional period of the late 1980s and early 1990s is characterized by increasing humanistic discourse in regard to higher education. Later post-Soviet documents, reflecting neoliberal policies, largely abandon social instrumentalism and more exclusively promote the economic role of higher education. Economic instrumentalism is the meeting point of two historical eras, with their respective ideologies and political agendas. Connecting Soviet and neoliberal discourses highlights the importance of historical legacies in regard to the economic, applied nature of higher education, and underlines the crucial role of the state, which facilitated acceptance of neoliberal agendas in Russian society. The analysis also contributes to further understanding of the nature of the neoliberal reforms globally and in post-socialist countries. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Higher education; Neoliberalism; Policy discourse; Purposes of higher education; Russian higher education; Soviet higher education,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013106572

At the functional level, the divisive normalization model (DNM; Heeger DJ. Vis Neurosci 9: 181–197, 1992) has accounted for a wide range of single-cell recordings in terms of a combination of linear filtering, nonlinear rectification, and divisive normalization. We propose standardizing the formulation of the DNM and implementing it in software that takes static grayscale images as inputs and produces firing rate responses as outputs. We also review a comprehensive suite of 30 empirical phenomena and report a series of simulation experiments that qualitatively replicate dozens of key experiments with a standard parameter set consistent with physiological measurements. This systematic approach identifies novel falsifiable predictions of the DNM. We show how the model simultaneously satisfies the conflicting desiderata of flexibility and falsifiability. Our key idea is that, while adjustable parameters are needed to accommodate the diversity across neurons, they must be fixed for a given individual neuron. This requirement introduces falsifiable constraints when this single neuron is probed with multiple stimuli.

In our opinion, this is because the use of existing models is limited by the conditions in which they are developed. Another question concerns the factors that can be significant for forecasting. Many authors suggest that indicators of the external environment, corporate governance as well as firm size contain important information; on the other hand, the large number of factors does not necessary increase predictive ability of a model. In this paper, we suggest the genetic algorithm based two-step classification method (TSCM) that allows both selecting the relevant factors and adapting the model itself to application. Classifiers of various models are trained at the first step and combined into the voting ensemble at the second step. The combination of random sampling and feature selection techniques were used to ensure the necessary diversity level of classifiers at the first step. The genetic algorithms are applied at the step of features selection and then at the step of weights determination in ensemble. The characteristics of the proposed method have been tested on the balanced set of data. It included 912 observations of Russian companies (456 bankrupts and 456 successful) and 55 features (financial ratios and macro/micro business environment factors). The proposed method has shown the best accuracy (0.934) value among tested models. It has also shown the most balanced precision-recall ratio. It found bankrupts (recall = 0.953) and not bankrupts (precision = 0.910) rather accurately than other tested models. The ability of method to select the task-relevant features has been also tested. Excluding the features that are significant for less than 50% of the classifiers in the ensemble improved the all performance metrics (accuracy = 0.951, precision = 0.932, recall = 0.965). So, the proposed method allows to improve the advantages and alleviate the weaknesses inherent in ordinary classifiers, enabling the business decisions support with a higher reliability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bankruptcy; Bankruptcy forecasting models; Ensembles of classifiers; Features selection; Genetic algorithm,Forecasting; Genetic algorithms; Bankruptcy; Business environments; Classification methods; Ensembles of classifiers; External environments; Features selection; Forecasting models; Selection techniques; Feature extraction,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024917583

We find that directors representing pressure-sensitive investors (i.e., banks and insurance companies) prefer lower financial leverage whereas pressure-resistant directors (i.e., mutual funds and pension funds) show no particular preference. When analyzed separately, directors appointed by banks and insurance firms have different attitudes. Bank representatives on boards increase both the financial leverage and the banking debt. This result suggests that some types of institutional directors provide financial resources to the firms on whose board they sit, supporting the view that boards manage the uncertainty associated with strategic decision making and provide firms with preferential access to resources and financial expertise. This research has interesting academic and policy implications for the debate over the proper degree of institutional involvement in corporate governance. Different institutional investors have different agendas and incentives for corporate governance, and, therefore, both researchers and policy makers should no longer consider institutional investors as a whole. In addition, our paper calls for new research on the causes and implications of institutional investor involvement in the corporate governance of nonfinancial firms. This new research could require new insights on the dynamics within the boards and on the interplay among the knowledge, incentives and attitudes of quite different directors. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Boards of directors; Civil-law countries; Corporate governance; Ethical behavior; Institutional investors,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045359207

The solution of the set problem using the graph theory allows obtaining the whole set of the permissible values of maintenance and selecting a value that, on the one hand, corresponds to the planned train time schedule (PTTS) and, on the other hand, differs minimally from the optimal with respect to the selected criterion. This takes a significant amount of time. The problem can be quickly solved using a genetic algorithm. The introduction of a new criterion—total excess time lapse between maintenance works over the permissible interval—allows obtaining the solution with any initial data, which is not always achievable when using the uniform-maintenance criterion.

We define higher and lower frequency energy components of the series that are related to periods ranging over 1 to 6 days and 6 days to 2 years, respectively. The lower frequency component is found to follow the solar activity, but the maxima of the higher frequency component are unexpectedly lower during the last epoch of high solar activity than during the preceding epoch of low solar activity. We also consider the birthrate of sunspot groups as another indicator of quickly varying components of the solar activity and show that it is the general growth of solar activity in the 1930–1940s that drives up this birthrate. We propose an autoregressive model that captures the opposite trends exhibited by the two representatives of the high-frequency content, accurately reproduces the evolutions of the lower and higher frequency energy components, and replicates the shape of the curve representing the daily sunspot numbers. The three following hypotheses underlie the model construction: (1) proxy series of solar activity can be modeled by a random process with a modulated noise; (2) sunspot's birth and disappearance rates, both following the solar cycle, determine properties of this process; and (3) the births of sunspots are positively correlated in time during epochs of high solar activity. We find that the mean birthrate varies as a power function of the mean lifetime. Derived constraints could contribute to narrowing the choice of a proper solar dynamo model. ©2017.

Under conditions of Landau-level crossing, caused by enhanced spin susceptibility in combination with the tilting of the magnetic field, the transition between two rivaling phases, paramagnetic and ferromagnetic, is traced in terms of optical spectra reconstruction. Synchronous sharp transformations are observed both in the photoluminescence structure and parameters of collective excitations upon transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic ordering. Based on these measurements, a phase diagram is constructed in terms of the two-dimensional electron density and tilt angle of the magnetic field. Apart from stable paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, an instability region is found at intermediate parameters with the Stoner transition occurring at ν≈2. The spin configuration in all cases is unambiguously determined by means of inelastic light scattering by spin-sensitive collective excitations. One indicator of the spin ordering is the intra-Landau-level spin exciton, which acquires a large spectral weight in the ferromagnetic phases. The other is an abrupt energy shift of the intersubband charge density excitation due to reconstruction of the many-particle energy contribution. From our analysis of photoluminescence and light scattering data, we estimate the ratio of surface areas occupied by the domains of the two phases in the vicinity of a transition point.

Multiple customers and average lead time are two most important issues in practice; however, no study has been carried out so far to investigate these two issues together for the two-stage supply chain scheduling problem. The main contribution of this study is to coordinate production and distribution decisions to obtain an effective scheduling in a two-stage supply chain that contains multiple customers and multiple manufacturers. A mixed integer linear optimization model is developed to formulate the problem with the average lead time objective. Because the problem has been shown to be NP-hard, a hybrid artificial bee colony and simulated annealing (HABCSA) algorithm is introduced and used to solve the problem. In addition, a lower bound (LB) and several structural properties for the problem are presented and different batching mechanisms are developed based on these properties. For the purpose of performance analysis of HABCSA with different batching mechanisms, detailed computational experiments are conducted using random instances which are generated based on real aluminum production data for different capacity levels.

In Indo-European, every type of NP embedding—genitives, adjectivizers, adpositions, head marking, or juxta-position—is unavailable for syntactic recursion in at least one attested language. In addition, attested pathways of change show that NP types that allow recursion can emerge and disappear in less than 1,000 years. This wide-ranging synchronic diversity and its high diachronic dynamics raise the possibility that at many hypothetical times in the history of the family recursive NP embedding could have been lost for all types simultaneously, parallel to what has occasionally been observed elsewhere (Everett 2005, Evans & Levinson 2009). Performing Bayesian phylogenetic analyses on a sample of fifty-five languages from all branches of Indo-European, we show, however, that it is extremely unlikely for such a complete loss to ever have occurred. When one or more morphosyntactic types become unavailable for syntactic recursion in an NP, an unconstrained alternative type is very likely to develop in the same language. This suggests that, while diachronic pathways away from NP recursion clearly exist, there is a ten-dency—perhaps a universal one—to maintain or develop syntactic recursion in NPs. A likely explanation for this evolutionary bias is that recursively embedded phrases are not just an option that languages have (Fitch et al. 2005), but they are in fact preferred by our processing system. © 2017, Linguistic Society of America.

The feature selection problem is difficult because of the complex structure of EEG signals. To classify the EEG signals with good accuracy, most of the recently published studies have used high-dimensional feature spaces. Our objective is to create a low-dimensional feature space that enables binary classification of EEG records. Methods: The proposed approach is based on our theory of the ϵ-complexity of continuous functions, which is extended here (see Appendix) to the case of vector functions. This extension permits us to handle multichannel-EEG records. The method consists of two steps. Firstly, we estimate the ϵ-complexity coefficients of the original signal and its finite differences. Secondly, we utilize the random forest (RF) or support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Results: We demonstrated the performance of our method on simulated data. We also applied it to the problem of classification of multichannel-EEG records related to a group of healthy adolescents (39 subjects) and a group of adolescents with schizophrenia (45 subjects). We found that the random forest classifier provides a superior result. In particular, out-of-bag accuracy in the case of RF was 85.3%. Using 10-fold cross-validation (CV), RF gave an average accuracy of 84.5% on a test set, whereas SVM gave an accuracy of 81.07%. We note that the highest accuracy on CV was 89.3%. To compare our method with the classical approach, we performed classification using the spectral features. In this case, the best performance was achieved using seven-dimensional feature space, with an average accuracy of 83.6%. Conclusions: We developed a model-free method for binary classification of EEG records. The feature space was reduced to four dimensions. The results obtained indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Binary classification; EEG analysis; Schizophrenia; ϵ-complexity,Biomedical signal processing; Decision trees; Diseases; Electroencephalography; Feature extraction; Support vector machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Binary classification; EEG analysis; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Feature selection problem; High-dimensional feature space; Random forest classifier; Schizophrenia; Classification (of information); accuracy; adolescent; Article; classification algorithm; clinical article; controlled study; electroencephalogram; epsilon complexity of continuous vector function; human; intermethod comparison; jackknife test; mathematical computing; random forest; recording; schizophrenia; signal detection; spectroscopy; support vector machine; theory construction; case control study; classification; electroencephalography; pathophysiology; procedures; reproducibility; Adolescent; Case-Control Studies; Classification; Electroencephalography; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Schizophrenia; Support Vector Machine,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029848857

On an undirected network G(V, E, w, c), a weight w(e) and a cost c(e) are prescribed for each edge e∈ E. The MSST problem is to find a spanning tree T∗ which makes the combined weight max e ∈ Tw(e) + ∑ e ∈ Tc(e) as small as possible. It can be solved in O(mlog n) time, where m: = | E| and n: = | V|. Whereas, in an inverse MSST problem, a given spanning tree T0 of G is not an optimal MSST. The sum-cost vector c is to be modified to c¯ so that T0 becomes an optimal MSST of the new network G(V, E, w, c¯) and the cost ‖ c¯ - c‖ can be minimized under Hamming Distance. First, we present a mathematical model for the inverse MSST problem and a method to check the feasibility. Then, under the weighted bottleneck-type Hamming distance, we design a binary search algorithm whose time complexity is O(mlog2n). Next, under the unit sum-type Hamming distance, which is also called l0 norm, we show that the inverse MSST problem (denoted by IMSST0) is NP- hard. Assuming NP⊈ DTIME(mpoly log m) , the problem IMSST0 is not approximable within a factor of 2log1-εm, for any ε&gt; 0. Finally, We consider the augmented problem of IMSST0 (denoted by AIMSST0), whose objective function is to multiply the l0 norm ‖ β‖ 0 by a sufficiently large number M plus the l1 norm ‖ β‖ 1. We show that the augmented problem and the l1 norm problem have the same Lagrange dual problems. Therefore, the l1 norm problem is the best convex relaxation (in terms of Lagrangian duality) of the augmented problem AIMSST0, which has the same optimal solution as that of the inverse problem IMSST0. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Approximability; Hamming distance; Inverse optimization problem; l0 norm; Max + sum spanning tree problem,Complex networks; Computational complexity; Costs; Hamming distance; Lagrange multipliers; Optimization; Relaxation processes; $$l_0$$l0norm; Approximability; Binary search algorithm; Inverse optimization; Lagrangian duality; Objective functions; Spanning tree problems; Undirected network; Inverse problems,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023775567

In line with his comprehensive approach to the assessment of language and other cognitive functions, he argued that deficits in understanding semantically reversible sentences and prepositional phrases, for example, were in line with a single neuropsychological factor of impaired spatial analysis and synthesis, since understanding such grammatical relationships would also draw on their spatial relationships. Critically, Luria demonstrated the neural underpinnings of this syndrome with the critical implication of the cortex of the left temporal-parietal-occipital (TPO) junction. In this study, we report neuropsychological and lesion profiles of 10 new cases of semantic aphasia. Modern neuroimaging techniques provide support for the relevance of the left TPO area for semantic aphasia, but also extend Luria's neuroanatomical model by taking into account white matter pathways. Our findings suggest that tracts with parietal connectivity – the arcuate fasciculus (long and posterior segments), the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, the superior longitudinal fasciculus II and III, and the corpus callosum – are implicated in the linguistic and non-linguistic deficits of patients with semantic aphasia. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Alexander Luria; Semantic aphasia; Temporal-parietal-occipital junction; White matter tracts,adult; aged; aphasia; Article; case report; clinical article; corpus callosum; female; functional anatomy; functional connectivity; human; inferior longitudinal fasciculus; left hemisphere; male; middle aged; neuroanatomy; neuroimaging; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipitofrontal fasciculus; semantics; superior longitudinal fasciculus; task performance; white matter; aphasia; brain; diagnostic imaging; nerve cell network; pathology; physiology; spatial behavior; Adult; Aged; Aphasia; Brain; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Net; Neuroimaging; Neuropsychological Tests; Spatial Behavior; White Matter,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006043051

How such norm enforcement is judged by others can be regarded as a meta-norm (i.e., a second-order norm). We examined whether meta-norms about peer punishment vary across cultures by having students in eight countries judge animations in which an agent who over-harvested a common resource was punished either by a single peer or by the entire peer group. Whether the punishment was retributive or restorative varied between two studies, and findings were largely consistent across these two types of punishment. Across all countries, punishment was judged as more appropriate when implemented by the entire peer group than by an individual. Differences between countries were revealed in judgments of punishers vs. non-punishers.

To improve Quality of Experience (QoE), a recently standardized framework, called Server and Network Assisted DASH (SAND), allows the client and the server to exchange control information with intermediate network nodes, e.g., with Wi-Fi Access Point (AP). In the paper, we show that such a framework is especially fruitful for short videos, which becomes more and more important nowadays. Specifically, we design a novel centralized algorithm, called SEBRA, which runs at the AP. It both allocates video bitrates and distributes channel time among all video clients.

In many European countries, youngsters are unemployed or have difficulty finding and obtaining jobs. This situation has deteriorated particularly after the crises, recessions and stagnation that has impacted European economies in recent years. In addition to the cyclical or crisis impact, structural factors are also very important. Additionally, prolonged crises, as in some Eurozone countries, have transformed a significant part of cyclical unemployment in structural (long term) unemployment. Young People and the Labour Market: A Comparative Perspective explores the condition of young people in the labour market. The authors present new evidence from several countries, with a special focus on Europe, and offer a comparative perspective. They investigate questions such as which structural conditions and labour market institutions guarantee better youth performance, which education systems and school-to-work processes are more effective and in which countries is gender differentiation less of an issue. All of the aforementioned, as well as many other comparisons which the authors make, are significant in helping to facilitate the successful design of labour and education policies. As the first investigation by economists to explore the complexity of this topic, this book will be useful to both economists and sociologists who are interested in the role of young people in the labour market, and the problem of youth unemployment. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Floro Ernesto Caroleo, Olga Demidova, Enrico Marelli and Marcello Signorelli; individual chapters, the contributors.

The sciences of systems tell us that when complex open systems … approach a condition of critical instability, they face a moment of truth: they either transform or break down.” (p. 108) In this article we provide our own vision of this Global Bifurcation. This work stems naturally from the research highlighted in the article titled “Transition to Crisis-Free Development: A Myth or Reality?” that was published in World Futures (Bondarenko, 2014a). In our new article, we move forward suggesting that crises-free development is not only possible but is also very likely, and paradoxically the world is now going through the most challenging transition from one paradigm of development to another. Based on our previous research as well as the findings of the Fifth Report to the Club of Rome, we suggest reasons for the development and implementation of a megaproject featuring a new model of life so as to make the paradigm shift possible, exclude negative implications of the upcoming technological “singularity,” and foster the achievement of an objectively defined goal of development, and this should reasonably require support from and direct involvement of the United Nations. The mechanism for implementation of this model suggests coordinating interests of the government, society, and business communities on each level with interests of particular individuals. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Coordination mechanism; Fifth Report to the Club of Rome; global bifurcation; goal; megaproject; new development paradigm; systemic crisis; UN; worldview,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029542690

The self-consistency of the water channel is considered within the linear shallow water theory, which implies that the channel depth and width are interrelated, so the wave propagates in such a channel without inner reflection from the bottom even if the water depth changes significantly. In the case of small-amplitude weakly dispersive waves, the reflection from the bottom is also small, which allows the use of a unidirectional approximation. A modified equation for Riemann waves is derived for the nondispersive case. The wave-breaking criterion (gradient catastrophe) for self-consistent channels is defined. If both weak nonlinearity and dispersion are accounted for, the variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation for waves in self-consistent channels is derived. Note that this is the first time that a KdV equation has been derived for waves in strongly inhomogeneous media.

A singlet Cooper pair cannot pass through an arm in this case, so the Josephson current is entirely due to the Cooper pair splitting, with two electrons going to different interferometer arms. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of Josephson transport due to split Cooper pairs, we assume the arms to be single-channel wires in the short-junction limit. Different geometries of the system (determined by the length of the arms and the phases acquired by quasiparticles during splitting between the arms) lead to qualitatively different behavior of the SQUID characteristics (the Andreev levels, the current-phase relation, and the critical Josephson current) as a function of two control parameters, the external magnetic flux and misorientation of the two spin filters. The current-phase relation can change its amplitude and shape, in particular, turning to a π junction form or acquiring additional zero crossings. The critical current can become a nonmonotonic function of the misorientation of the spin filters and the magnetic flux (on half of period). Periodicity with respect to the magnetic flux is doubled, in comparison to conventional SQUIDs. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038557482

After a short description of the current state of the world heroin market and its basic properties-maturity, segmentation, and elasticity-this chapter briefly outlines the history of heroin consumption and its regulation over the last 150 years. Historically, most interventions in the heroin market sought to curb its availability and consumption by using either vinegar (incarcerating drug sellers and users) or honey (diverting addicts to treatment). However, there is no conclusive evidence that either way is effective in reducing the number of heroin users and addicts; to a large extent, drugs become popular or fall out of fashion due to the natural history of epidemics and other social and cultural factors. Thus, the traditional drug policy goal of addressing the root cause-reducing the number of heroin users-is largely misplaced. Currently, many scholars conceive of ""harm reduction"" as an overarching goal of drug policy. As health-oriented harm reduction does not aim to curtail drug use per se but reduce some of its harmful consequences, criminological harm reduction applied to drugrelated crime does not aim to prevent violation of drug laws per se but rather to prevent certain harmful consequences of drug use and sales. We then use the influential Goldstein model of drug-related crime to show how harm reduction principles can be applied to heroin-related drug crime. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,,English,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043832166

A computational analysis of structural and dynamical properties was performed using molecular dynamics method. Monomers of peptides were considered incorporated into hydrated lipid bilayers. It was confirmed, that all these TM peptides have stable helical conformation in lipid environment, and the mutual adaptation of peptides and membrane was observed. It was shown that incorporation of the peptide into membrane results in the modulation of local and mean structural properties of the bilayer. Each peptide interacts with lipid acyl chains having special binding sites on the surface of central part of α-helix that exist for at least 200 ns.

An HKT metric is a natural analogue of a Kähler metric on a complex manifold. We push this analogy further, proving a quaternionic analogue of the result of Buchdahl and of Lamari that a compact complex surface M admits a Kähler structure if and only if b1(M) is even. We show that a hypercomplex manifold M with the Obata holonomy contained in SL(2,H) admits an HKT structure if and only if H1(O(M,I)) is even-dimensional. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Hypercomplex Geometry; Hyperkähler with torsion metrics,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032015485

In this paper the authors try to develop the common basis view on the strategic and non-strategic project and suggest a number of criteria that could be used by the project managers, porgrammes managers and portfolio directors as well as other stakeholders. Research and justification methods of main conclusions were chosen: qualitative analysis of professional standards in project management on subject to references and disclosure of the question of strategy and strategic projects; a case study of strategic and non-strategic projects; expert survey on the criteria of differences in strategic and non-strategic projects. The authors identified criteria for the differences in strategic and non-strategic projects, prove conclusively that these fundamentally different types of projects require different methods, techniques and tools of management.

This article examines and evaluates these two policies and asks if they were part of a “Latvianization” program that deliberately targeted Russians for denial of residency permits and required Russians to gain Latvian-language competency within a two-year timeframe or face the threat of dismissal. In an effort to restore the primacy of the Latvian language, the national communists created a law enforcing knowledge of Latvian and Russian for Communist Party and government functionaries and service sector personnel. Using the Soviet legal system, the national communists also attempted to halt the influx of predominantly Slavic immigration to the Latvian capital, Riga. By instituting passport restrictions on settling in the city, the national communists sought to limit Slavic migration in order to maintain Riga’s Latvian character and reduce pressure on the city’s housing supply and municipal services. Existing studies deem passport restrictions in other Soviet cities a failure. The author argues, however, that the national communists’ scheme was generally successful, dramatically curbing migration to Riga during its operation. © 2017 Association for the Study of Nationalities.",Latvia; migration; national communism; Russification; Soviet periphery,communism; historical perspective; immigration policy; language; law enforcement; migration; Latvia,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024369569

After condemnation both domestically and internationally, the practice became completely illegal in 2013. Nevertheless, in 2015, the government lifted the donation prohibition, allowing foreign governments and international and state organizations to donate to the Interior Ministry. Differentiating between utilitarian and moral models of corporate social responsibility is important, since genuine donors create higher value through their prosocial deeds than self-interested ones. Given Bulgaria’s excessive spending on public order and the ambiguous nature of donations to public servants, we seek to understand the corporate motivations for donating to the police. To address this question, we draw upon theories of corporate philanthropy, social exchange, and entrepreneurial orientation and use unique face-to face interview data from 2011 to 2013 with police officers and businesspeople. Our qualitative findings point to multifaceted drivers of philanthropy beyond those considered in the dominant strategic-instrumental perspective. We argue that donations to the police can be an expression of business executives’ altruistic values, a desire to forge strategic alliances, enhance status in social hierarchies, a form of political reconciliation, or a protection payment. Lastly, we present descriptive statistics of money donated to the Interior Ministry, discuss the potential socioeconomic consequences, and propose policies to reduce police reliance on private financing. © 2017 Sage Publications.",Bulgaria; Corporate philanthropy; Corruption; Police; Social exchange,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032440313

The medium is considered to be formed by three phases: cells, extracellular fluid, and an additional phase that is responsible for active interaction forces between cells and, for instance, may correspond to a system of protrusions that provide the development of active contractile forces. The deformation of the medium, which is identified with the deformation of the cell phase, consists of two components: elastic deformation of individual cells and cell rearrangements. The elastic deformation is associated with stresses in the cell phase. The spherical component of the stress tensor describes the nonlinear resistance of the cellular medium, which leads to the impossibility of its excessive compression. The constitutive equation for pressure in the cell phase is taken in the form of a nonlinear dependence on the volume cell density. The rearrangement of cells is considered as a flow controlled by stresses in the cell phase, active stresses, and fluid pressure. The tensor of active stresses is assumed to be spherical and nonlocally dependent on the cell density. Assuming that the process of biological tissue deformation is slow, we obtained a reduced model that neglects the elastic deformation of cells, compared to the inelastic deformation. A linear stability analysis of a spatially uniform steady-state solution was performed. The hydrostatic pressure of fluid is present among the parameters that are responsible for the loss of stability of the steady-state solution: an increase in it has a destabilizing effect owing to the action of the component of the interphase interaction force that is determined by the fluid pressure. The model we obtained can be used to describe the process of cavity formation in an initially homogeneous cell spheroid. The role of local and nonlocal mechanisms of active stress generation in the formation of cavity is investigated. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",active media; biological morphogenesis; cell systems,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042561165

In this paper, the physical and geometric properties of stem-loop structures at the 3′-end of human transposons are identified and compared with properties of the structures of other genome regions.

A model has been built using machine-learning methods, which recognizes stem-loop structures according to their physical and geometric characteristics with 94% accuracy. The most important parameters in the recognition model are hydrophilicity, enthalpy, Rise, and Twist.

The purpose of the article is an analytical study of the changes that occur in the thinking of Internet consumers. Materials and Methods: The research is conducted on the basis of the method of theoretical analysis by adopting an activity and synergistic approaches. Results: The authors have identified the following main characteristics of Web 3.0 and Web 4.0 content: semantic structure, cooper ativity, clustering, wide opportunities for consumer self-expression, self-developing basic personal content, self-correcting errors system, efficient and convenient information management, accessibility, simplicity and maximum convenience, development and use of additional features, human resource management in the current time mode, crystallization, and the availability of maximum possible security of consumers. The authors emphasize that in the present context of accelerating scientific and technological progress and the development of global information networks, qualitative changes in the thinking activity of the modern person are taking place. Content has a developing effect on consumers' thinking and thinking itself becomes like content. The authors suggest the hypothesis that there exist a combination of two mechanisms of self-development of content thinking: the external mechanism - the self-development of content, and the internal mechanism - the reflection. Conclusions: Conclusions are drawn that the main characteristics of such thinking are the following: accumulation of many different types and styles of thinking, the leading method is synthetic deduction, increasing entropy, increasing singularity, operation within the framework of the ""peace"" category, expanding and tapering integrity, variability and different levels of clusters of processing and packaging of information, bringing thought to the ultimate limits of philosophical categories, multivector focus of reality research, and creative self-development.

Endocannabinoids (eCBs) can affect the neuronal survival during excitotoxicity and brain damage. Using a kainic acid (KA)-induced experimental SE model, we investigated whether cellular changes entail damage to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and nuclei in hippocampal cells (CA1 field), and whether these alterations can be diminished by treatment with URB597, an inhibitor of eCB enzymatic degradation. Material and methods SE was induced in Wistar rats by the microinjection of KA into the lateral ventricle. URB597 or a vehicle (10% DMSO) were injected in the same way into the brain of animals 24 h after the KA infusion and then daily for the next nine days. The behavior of animals was controlled visually and recorded with a video system. The intensity of SE significantly varied in different animals. Convulsive (stages 3–5 according to the Racine scale) and nonconvulsive seizures (mainly stages 1, 2 and rarely 3, 4) were recognized. Results Two weeks after SE, a significant loss of hippocampal cells occurred in animals with KA injections. In survived cells, ultrastructural alterations in ER, mitochondria, and nuclei of hippocampal neurons were observed. The degree of cell injury depended on the severity of SE. Alterations evoked by moderate seizures were prevented or diminished by URB597, but strong seizures induced mostly irreversible damage.

Such frames, however, may be crucial not only when interacting with the visual world, but also in language comprehension, since even the simplest utterance can be understood from different perspectives. While significant progress has been made in elucidating how linguistic factors, such as pronouns, influence reference frame adoption, the neural underpinnings of this ability are largely unknown. Building on the neural reuse framework, this study tested the hypothesis that reference frame processing in language comprehension involves mechanisms used in navigation and spatial cognition. We recorded EEG activity in 28 healthy volunteers to identify spatiotemporal dynamics in (1) spatial navigation, and (2) a language comprehension task (sentence-picture matching). By decomposing the EEG signal into a set of maximally independent activity patterns, we localised and identified a subset of components which best characterised perspective-taking in both domains. Remarkably, we find individual co-variability across these tasks: people's strategies in spatial navigation are also reflected in their construction of sentential perspective. Furthermore, a distributed network of cortical generators of such strategy-dependent activity responded not only in navigation, but in sentence comprehension. Thus we report, for the first time, evidence for shared brain mechanisms across these two domains - advancing our understanding of language's interaction with other cognitive systems, and the individual differences shaping comprehension. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"adult; allocentric; Article; cognition; comprehension; egocentric; electroencephalogram; human; human experiment; language processing; linguistics; male; nerve cell network; neurophysiology; nonhuman; normal human; priority journal; rat; reference frame processing; signal detection; spatial orientation; spatiotemporal analysis; speech articulation; task performance; brain cortex; electroencephalography; individuality; language; nerve cell network; pattern recognition; physiology; procedures; spatial orientation; speech perception; young adult; Adult; Cerebral Cortex; Comprehension; Electroencephalography; Humans; Individuality; Language; Male; Nerve Net; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Spatial Navigation; Speech Perception; Young Adult",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027858332

Furthermore, there is a contradiction between ease of extending the data model and ease of analysis. The modern 'Data Lake' approach, promises extreme ease of adding new data to a data model, however it is prone to eventually becoming a Data Swamp – unstructured, ungoverned, and out of control Data Lake where due to a lack of process, standards and governance, data is hard to find, hard to use and is consumed out of context. This paper introduces a novel technique, highly normalized Big Data using Anchor modeling, that provides a very efficient way to store information and utilize resources, thereby providing ad-hoc querying with high performance for the first time in massively parallel processing databases. This technique is almost as convenient for expanding data model as a Data Lake, while it is internally protected from transforming to Data Swamp.

A numerical model of magnetic dipolarization accompanied by plasma turbulence has been constructed and studied. The model allows one to investigate the particle acceleration due to the action of three principal mechanisms: (1) plasma turbulence; (2) magnetic dipolarization; (3) their simultaneous action. For the given velocity kappa-distributions, we obtained energy spectra of three types of accelerated particles, i.e., protons p + , ions of oxygen O + , and electrons e – . It has been shown that the combined mechanism of dipolarization with turbulence (3) makes the largest contribution to the increase in the energy of protons and heavy ions as compared with a separate action of each of mechanisms (1) and (2); in this case, electrons accelerate less. The consideration of the joint action of acceleration mechanisms (1) and (2) can explain the apparition of particles with energies on the order of magnitude equal to hundreds keV in the Earth’s magnetosphere tail. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037357635

The overview of the existing literature on the employment effects of technological change shows that on the micro-level there exists strong and positive relationship between innovations and employment growth in firms; on the sectoral level this correlation becomes ambiguous; on the macro-level the impact of new technologies seems to be positive or neutral. This implies that fears of explosive growth of technological unemployment in the foreseeable future are exaggerated. Our analysis further suggests that new technologies affect mostly the structure of employment rather than its level. Additionally we argue that automation and digitalisation would change mostly task sets within particular occupations rather than distribution of workers by occupations.,Compensation theory; Computerization; Labor demand; Robotics; Technological change; Technological unemployment,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034657941

The complex HF field is governed by the linear Schrödinger equation with a potential generated by the real LF component, which, in turn, is governed by the KdV equation including the ponderomotive coupling term, representing the feedback of the HF field onto the LF component. First, we study the evolution of pulse-shaped pulses by means of direct simulations. In the case when the dispersion of the LF component is weak in comparison to its nonlinearity, the input gives rise to several solitons in which the HF component is much broader than its LF counterpart. In the opposite case, the system creates a single soliton with approximately equal widths of both components. Collisions between stable solitons are studied too, with a conclusion that the collisions are inelastic, with a greater soliton getting still stronger, and the smaller one suffering further attenuation. Robust intrinsic modes are excited in the colliding solitons. A new family of approximate analytical two-component soliton solutions with two free parameters is found for an arbitrary relative strength of the nonlinearity and dispersion of the LF component, assuming weak feedback of the HF field onto the LF component. Further, a one-parameter (non-generic) family of exact bright-soliton solutions, with mutually proportional HF and LF components, is produced too. Intrinsic dynamics of the two-component solitons, induced by a shift of their HF component against the LF one, is also studied, by means of numerical simulations, demonstrating excitation of a robust intrinsic mode. In addition to the above-mentioned results for LF-dominated two-component solitons, which always run in one (positive) velocities, we produce HF-dominated soliton complexes, which travel in the opposite (negative) direction. They are obtained in a numerical form and by means of a quasiadiabatic analytical approximation. The solutions with positive and negative velocities correspond, respectively, to super- and subsonic Davydov-Scott solitons.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034223654

Attention is paid to microturbines and low-, medium-, high-, and superhigh-power GTPs. The efficiency of the gas-turbine plants of domestic and foreign manufacture is compared. The actual values of the installed capacity utilization factor and the corresponding efficiency values are calculated for most GTPs operating in the country. The long-term demand of the country’s electric power industry for GTPs for the period until 2040 is determined. The estimates have been obtained for three basic applications of the gas turbines, viz., for replacement of the GTPs that have exhausted their lifetime, replacement of outdated gas-turbine plants at gas-and-oilburning power plants, and construction of new thermal power plants to cover the anticipated growing demand for electric power. According to the findings of the research, the main item in the structure of the demand for GTPs will be their use to replace the decommissioned steam-turbine plants, predominantly those integrated into combined-cycle plants. The priority of the reconstruction of the thermal power plants in operation over the construction of new ones is determined by the large excess of accumulated installed capacities in the country and considerable savings on capital costs using production sites with completed infrastructure. It is established that medium- and high-power GTPs will be the most in-demand plants in the electric power industry. The demand for low-power GTPs will increase at high rates. The demand for microturbines is expected to be rather great. The demand for superhigh-power plants will become quantitatively significant after 2025 and grow rapidly afterwards. The necessity of accelerated development of competitive domestic GTPs with a wide range of capacities and mastering of their series manufacture as well as production of licensed gas turbines at a high production localization level on the territory of the country is shown.

The empirical results indicate that there are threshold effects in the CEO power-debt relationship and CEO power-operating lease relationship. In particular, we find that firms tend to use more debt financing (and operating leasing) when CEO power index below a certain threshold level; beyond the threshold level, CEO tends to manipulate firm capital structure to pursue their own interests, thus using less debt financing and operating leasing. In addition, our estimation results suggest a positive relationship between debt and operating leases when CEO power is smaller than certain threshold, while it becomes negative if the power index exceeds the threshold level. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Capital structure; CEO power; Debt ratio; Lease; SMEs,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028947188

Accordingly, the role of executive processes is to prevent self-inhibition in supraliminal conditions: when cognitive resources are depleted by a parallel task, the self-inhibition mechanism becomes active and irrelevantly potentiated affordances are inhibited, leading to the emergence of an inverse SRC effect. In addition, the difference between data patterns observed in the two experiments suggests that the exact roles of the executive processes involved during the activation of affordances may differ. The results suggest a mechanism for action-related activation monitoring based on a flexible control over automatically potentiated actions. The paper discusses the proposed mechanism in detail and outlines further research directions. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,executive function; human; motor activity; physiology; psychomotor performance; Executive Function; Humans; Motor Activity; Psychomotor Performance,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988553115

We make the case in this article that in comparative education analysis, there is persuasive support in political theory to consider subnational state comparisons in federalist nations and that such comparisons can yield valuable insights for improving education in the federal nation-state as a whole. Wefocus on one federal country, Brazil, and on the possible differences in the “effectiveness” of state education administrations in delivering education.

Such a model neglects to account for observed periods where firms experience large fluctuations due to uncertainty related to its R&D activities, external competitive or regulatory environments. Empirical evidence also shows that the behavior of these firms is difficult to describe – let alone predict – using this Gaussian process. With ambidexterity as a theoretical basis, we show that the value of HTSF can be statistically described as the result of a combination of two distinct random walks: an exploitative steady state component characterized by Neo-Marshallian equilibrium and low volatility; and a more dynamic component with high volatility reflecting bursts of large and rapid changes associated with Schumpeterian outcomes of explorative processes. A mixture of two normal distributions provides an overall function that is more reflective of the empirical evidence and provides a quantitative measure for the theory that firms engage in concurrent exploration/exploitation activities. A linear relationship between the two components of the mixture distribution that describe the stock value of these firms also emerges. By understanding this dual nature and its impact on stock value, firms can better manage resources and prepare for the increase in variability that are associated with exploration activities. A more accurate financial description of HTSF that reduces or that anticipates uncertainty may lead to financial tools and option pricing methods that put a premium on the value of HTSF markets, incentivizing investors to invest more in such firms. © 2016 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031725148

Wellbeing is assessed with two questions about life satisfaction and self-rated mental health. Those in the integration group have a significantly higher level on both measures of wellbeing. The experience of discrimination is significantly associated with being in the separation group. The effect of discrimination on wellbeing varied by acculturation profile: marginalization amplifies the effect of discrimination, while assimilation mitigates it.

This may be important, e.g., when planning neurosurgery or focused nTMS therapy, or when assessing plastic changes during neurorehabilitation. Conventionally, a cortical location is considered to belong to the motor cortex if the maximum electric field (E-field) targeted there evokes a motor-evoked potential in a muscle. However, the cortex is affected by a broad E-field distribution, which tends to broaden estimates of representation areas by stimulating also the neighboring areas in addition to the maximum E-field location. Our aim was to improve the estimation of nTMS-based motor maps by taking into account the E-field distribution of the stimulation pulse. The effect of the E-field distribution was considered by calculating the minimum-norm estimate (MNE) of the motor representation area. We tested the method on simulated data and then applied it to recordings from six healthy volunteers and one stroke patient. We compared the motor representation areas obtained with the MNE method and a previously introduced interpolation method. The MNE hotspots and centers of gravity were close to those obtained with the interpolation method. The areas of the maps, however, depend on the thresholds used for outlining the areas. The MNE method may improve the definition of cortical motor areas, but its accuracy should be validated by comparing the results with maps obtained with direct cortical stimulation of the cortex where the E-field distribution can be better focused. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Electric field; Minimum-norm estimate; Motor cortex; Motor representation; Motor-evoked potential; Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation,"adult; Article; brain ischemia; case report; clinical article; controlled study; cortical excitability; electric field; electromyography; human; male; mathematical and statistical procedures; middle aged; minimum norm estimate; motor cortex; motor evoked potential; motor performance; neuronavigation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; stroke patient; transcranial magnetic stimulation; biological model; brain mapping; female; motor cortex; motor evoked potential; physiology; procedures; transcranial magnetic stimulation; Adult; Brain Mapping; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Neurological; Motor Cortex; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024487799

It is found that processes of partial evaporation, melting, and crystallization of the surface layer of vanadium samples take place in the plasma flux power density range q = 108–1010 W/cm2 and the ion flux density range q = 1010–1012 W/cm2. The surface relief is wavelike. There are microcracks, gas-filled bubbles (blisters), and traces of fracture on the surface. The blisters are failed in the solid state. The character of blister fracture is similar to that observed during usual ion irradiation in accelerators. The samples irradiated at relatively low power density (q = 107–108 W/cm2) demonstrate the ejection of microparticles (surface fragments) on the side facing plasma. This process is assumed to be due to the fact that the unloading wave formed in the sample–target volume reaches its irradiated surface. Under certain irradiation conditions (sample–anode distance, the number of plasma pulses), a block microstructure with block sizes of several tens of microns forms on the sample surfaces.

In this paper, we draw on data from a 2011 Levada-Center survey to examine the attitudes and social solidarity of the Russian population towards drug policies in general and towards the introduction of a proposed voluntary drug insurance system in particular. In addition to being among the first to explore these important questions in the post-Communist setting, we make three important contributions to the emerging policy debates. First, we find that, if introduced immediately and without careful planning and preparation, Russia's voluntary drug insurance scheme is likely to collapse financially due to the over-representation of high-risk unhealthy individuals opting in to the scheme. Second, the negative attitude of higher income groups towards the redistribution of wealth to the poor may further impede government efforts to introduce voluntary drug insurance.

It is a hybrid method, combining importance sampling through Markov chains with elements of sequential Monte Carlo in the form of population control. While it appears to provide algorithmic capabilities for the simulation of such systems that are roughly comparable to those of more established approaches such as parallel tempering, it is intrinsically much more suitable for massively parallel computing. Here, we tap into this structural advantage and present a highly optimized implementation of the population annealing algorithm on GPUs that promises speed-ups of several orders of magnitude as compared to a serial implementation on CPUs. While the sample code is for simulations of the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model, it should be easily adapted for simulations of other spin models, including disordered systems. Our code includes implementations of some advanced algorithmic features that have only recently been suggested, namely the automatic adaptation of temperature steps and a multi-histogram analysis of the data at different temperatures.

Although the topological protection is lost for the Ising system, the mapping provides additional insight into the nature of the quantum states. By controlling the local magnetic field, one can separate the Ising chain into ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, corresponding to topological and nontopological sections of the fermionic system. In this paper we propose (topologically nonprotected) protocols performing the braiding operation, and in fact also more general rotations. We first consider a T-junction geometry, but we also propose a protocol for a purely one-dimensional (1D) system. Both setups rely on an extra spin-12 coupler. By including the extra spin in the T-junction geometry, we overcome limitations due to the 1D character of the Jordan-Wigner transformation. In the 1D geometry the coupler, which controls one of the Ising links, should be manipulated once the ferromagnetic (topological) section of the chain is moved far away. We also propose experimental implementations of our scheme. One is based on a chain of flux qubits which allows for all needed control fields. We also describe how to translate our scheme for the 1D setup to a chain of superconducting wires hosting each a pair of Majorana edge states. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038835945

The findings suggest that owner-managers play a crucial role when engaging in sustainability activities jointly with employees and other stakeholders, through which individual-level actions enhance collective organizational-level sustainability practices. The U.K. and Italian cases highlight 2 contrasting approaches to dealing with sustainability; thus, the paper contributes to the emerging literature on SME microfoundations and sustainability.

One of the best tools for the understanding of oscillations at the single neuron level is the phase-resetting curve (PRC). Synchronization in networks of neurons, effects of noise on the rhythms, effects of transient stimuli on the ongoing rhythmic activity, and many other features can be understood by the PRC. However, most macroscopic brain rhythms are generated by large populations of neurons, and so far it has been unclear how the PRC formulation can be extended to these more common rhythms. In this paper, we describe a framework to determine a macroscopic PRC (mPRC) for a network of spiking excitatory and inhibitory neurons that generate a macroscopic rhythm. We take advantage of a thermodynamic approach combined with a reduction method to simplify the network description to a small number of ordinary differential equations. From this simplified but exact reduction, we can compute the mPRC via the standard adjoint method. Our theoretical findings are illustrated with and supported by numerical simulations of the full spiking network. Notably our mPRC framework allows us to predict the difference between effects of transient inputs to the excitatory versus the inhibitory neurons in the network. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,Differential equations; Neurons; Ordinary differential equations; Inhibitory neurons; Large population; Phase resetting curves; Reduction method; Rhythmic activity; Spiking neural networks; Thermodynamic approaches; Transient stimuli; Neural networks,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032579629

We reveal a very rich dynamical behavior of this hybrid system. In particular, we find that the energy dissipation in one of the subsystems can enhance quantum effects in another subsystem. For instance, optimal cavity decay assists the stabilization of entanglement and quantum correlations between qubits even in the steady state and the compensation of finite qubit relaxation. On the contrary, energy dissipation in qubit subsystems results in enhanced photon production from vacuum for strong modulation but destroys both quantum concurrence and quantum mutual information between qubits. Our results provide deeper insights to nonstationary cavity quantum electrodynamics in the context of quantum information processing and might be of importance for dissipative quantum state engineering. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,Electrodynamics; Energy dissipation; Hybrid systems; Information theory; Modulation; Photons; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Quantum optics; Quantum theory; Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics; Dynamical behaviors; Mutual informations; Of quantum-information; Periodic modulation; Photon production; Quantum correlations; Quantum-state engineering; Quantum entanglement,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032979443

The naive scaling limit of a DLA cluster by its diameter is thus deterministic and one-dimensional. At the same time, on all scales from the particle size to the size of the entire cluster it has a nontrivial box-counting fractal dimension which corresponds to the overall growth rate, which, in turn, is smaller than the growth rate along the axes.

Despite the high prevalence of IQMS in the US and European economies, until recently, in Russian organizations, separate management systems for each particular area were considered to be the norm: ecology, quality management of products, health and safety of personnel, etc. The reasons for the low prevalence of IQMS in small organizations in Russia are observed. We discuss such major factors as, for instance, the lack of a unified model for the formation and implementation of an IQMS at the enterprise. The methods for calculating the costs of practical implementation of IQMS, depending on the resource and organizational requirements for improving the efficiency, are not standardized. Specific measures are proposed in order to encourage the development and penetration of IQMS in Russian organizations.

The complexity problem of realizations of Boolean functions over a basis having negation as the only nonmonotone element was completely solved by A. A. Markov. In 1957 he showed that the minimum number of NOT gates sufficient for realization of any Boolean function f (the inversion complexity of the function f) is log2(d(f)+1). Here d(f) is the maximum number of the changes of the function f from larger to smaller values over all increasing chains of tuples of variables values. In the present paper Markov's result is extended to the case of realization of k-valued logic functions. We show that the minimum number of Post negations (that is, functions of the form x+1(mod k)) that is sufficient to realize an arbitrary function of k-valued logic is log2(d(f)+1) and the minimum number of ukasiewicz negation (that is, functions of the form k-1-x) that is sufficient to realize an arbitrary k-valued logic function is logk(d(f)+1).

However, in case of systems with limited computational resources, such as smart-phones or autonomous robots, high resolution dense depth map estimation may be challenging. In this paper, we study the problem of semi-dense depth map interpolation along with low resolution depth map upsampling. We present an end-to-end learnable residual convolutional neural network architecture that achieves fast interpolation of semi-dense depth maps with different sparse depth distributions: uniform, sparse grid and along intensity image gradient. We also propose a loss function combining classical mean squared error with perceptual loss widely used in intensity image super-resolution and style transfer tasks. We show that with some modifications, this architecture can be used for depth map superresolution.

The generated linearly polarized condensate is found to lose its stability at excitation densities above the threshold value: it passes into the regime of inner Josephson oscillations with strongly oscillating circular and diagonal linear polarization degrees, as well as monotonically decreased oscillations in linear polarization accompanied by a gradual increase in the condensate of the low-sublevel component. These phenomena occur with a relatively small decrease in the total polarization and spatial coherence of the spinor condensate. At high LP densities, the LP-LP interaction leads to the nonlinear Josephson effect. All effects are found to be well reproduced by the model based on spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The cause of the instability was clarified by considering a simplified model of the spinor 0D oscillator: it is spin anisotropy of the LP-LP interaction. The threshold density was shown to increase with decreasing difference Δα of the constants of the interparticle interaction of LPs with identical and opposite spins as δl/Δα, where δl is the LP level splitting. The reduction in the linear polarization is connected with the fact that the LPs escaping from the condensate with oscillating circular polarization carry off more energy than from the linearly polarized one. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037717113

This problem becomes apparent when states respond to separatism by manipulating the fear of terrorism to justify undemocratic actions in the name of national security.

In many aspects, our results confirm previous empirical findings showing that women are more skeptical toward GM food and a higher level of respondents’ education and the presence of minors in households are negatively correlated with their willingness to purchase a processed food containing GM ingredients. Moreover, a higher risk perception of GM food is negatively associated with the probability to purchase and consume such foods. However, our results indicate that risk perceptions of GM food seem to be relatively low in comparison to other studies with 41.5% of Tajik respondents connecting no risks with GM food.

This improves cost-efficiency for both inter- and intra-datacenter connections and simplifies network management. We also identify a fundamental tradeoff between extra added capacity and simplicity of representation for a given network. Our analytic results are supported by extensive simulation results on hundreds of real network topologies. One result is that by adding 10-30% extra capacity to evaluated real-world networks one can simplify them down to a star topology with a single switch, while all routing and bandwidth allocation decisions on the simplified topology can be mapped back to the original network.

The opening of data transforms the relationship between SSOs and other stakeholders. In this article, the institutionalization of SSO evaluation system in Russia is studied. The critical role of open data is demonstrated and the inclusion of stakeholders was found to be a key factor to make the evaluation system truly effective. Their study reveals that an ecosystem approach ensures that stakeholder demands are included in SSO evaluation and assessment process.

I test the hypothesis that the uses of volitional forms (optative, imperative, hortative and jussive) in complement clauses of the verbs of wish and in purpose clauses in East Caucasian languages evolve under the influence of Azerbaijanian. Design/methodology/approach and data and analysis: The data of 13 languages are considered in the paper. To prove that shared features are contact-induced, two control languages are included in the sample. Archi belongs to the same genetic group as the languages that use volitionals in subordinate clauses, but is exposed to Azerbaijanian to a lesser extent. Axaxdərə Akhvakh belongs to another group, but has strong contacts with Azerbaijanian due to recent migration. Findings/conclusions: A survey shows that volitionals are used in subordinate clauses most extensively in those languages whose speakers exhibit a high level of bilingualism in Azerbaijanian, and where the contact has been longer. I assume that there is a hierarchy of borrowability of subordinate constructions involving volitionals. Originality: Although the influence of Turkic languages on the languages of the Caucasus in the domain of syntax has been previously discussed, the usage of volitionals in subordinate clauses has not. Significance/implications: It is acknowledged that social factors play an important role in shaping the linguistic consequences of contact. However, evidence of the correspondence between social factors and structural outcomes of language contact is still very scarce. The relevance of two social factors is shown in this paper: the ratio of bilingual speakers and the duration of contact. Limitations: I advance the hypothesis that connects the borrowability of particular constructions to their typological frequency, but the typology of subordinate uses of volitionals is not well enough investigated to make final conclusions. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",complement clause; East Caucasian languages; imperative; Language contact; optative; purpose clause; structural copying; syntactic borrowing; Turkic languages; volitionals,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028770820

The interactions between actors in the KT force individual agents to adjust and refine their models of operation and provide targeted output which supports the activities of other agents. Among companies, we saw the emergence of the open innovation concept which stresses the will of companies to cooperate in innovation. At the same time, the scientific community is increasingly challenged by open access to research findings and by online learning courses. These two recent developments are among the most important that were significantly initiated by gatekeepers, themselves especially important actors within the KT because they possess the power to orchestrate and direct the linkages between KT actors. Until recently, the role of gatekeepers within the KT has been little analysed. The paper suggests that understanding the role and characteristics of gatekeepers is essential for substantial and sustainable interactions between KT agents and the fulfilment of the Third Mission of universities. Therefore, the linkages go beyond purely knowledge and technology transfer linkages but rather show how gatekeepers influence competency-building for delivering information and technologies to other organizations and enhancing institutions' absorptive capacity which is argued to be crucial for implementing effective, targeted, and productive interactions of universities. It is argued that universities need to be aware of gatekeepers' competences and powers well in advance to make use of knowledge exchange with other parties to shape society. In addition, it is argued that universities' skill base – as shown in researchers' competences – is a vital element of universities' intellectual capital which should be included in universities' performance evaluation frameworks. Finally, the paper argues that it is important for policy making in science, technology and innovation to possess knowledge of gatekeepers' position in the KT to enhance collaboration between KT agents and provide research institutions, namely universities, with the competences needed to vitalize the universities' ‘Third Mission’. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Expertise; Gatekeepers; Internationalization; Knowledge Triangle; Modernization agenda; Societal challenges; Third Mission,Education; Innovation; Knowledge management; Reconfigurable hardware; Technology transfer; Expertise; Gatekeepers; Internationalization; Knowledge Triangle; Societal challenges; Third Mission; Societies and institutions; innovation; Internet; learning; modernization; research; science and technology; technology transfer; university sector,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961911071

The ringing detection algorithm is based on construction of the synthetic dictionary that is used to represent ringing effect as a sum of blurred edge and pure ringing component. This decomposition enables us to estimate image ringing level. We analyze two ringing suppression methods. First method is based on learning joint dictionaries and shows good performance for the whole image on average. However for high ringing levels the performance of this method decreases due to the influence of the ringing artefact on the sparse representation parameters. The second method is based on separate learning of natural images dictionary and pure ringing dictionary and it does not suffer from this problem. In this article we present a new ringing suppression method that is based on the method using separate dictionaries. The method works best in the areas of edges and for higher levels of ringing effect. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",image ringing effect; sparse representations,Computer vision; Blurred edges; Detection algorithm; Natural images; Ringing effect; Separate learning; Sparse representation; Suppression method; Pattern recognition,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037527371

Oddly, while the theme of altruism was of primary significance in classical sociology of morality, modern sociology seems to have relatively little interest in studying altruism and altruistic behavior (although there are some exceptions) and the field is largely dominated by other social and behavioral sciences. The article aims at reconsidering altruism as a concept and as an area of research in sociology of morality by reviewing the major concepts of altruism in classical sociology and modern behavioral sciences. The article argues that, although for the ‘new’ sociology of morality it is necessary to take into account behavioral and psychological perspectives, a promising sociological approach to the study of altruism in different social contexts can be based on renewing the classical focus on the normative components of moral behavior. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",Altruism; altruistic behavior; moral norms; morality; social norms; sociology of morality,,English,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029529874

In this paper we discuss how, by attempting to extend the Segal approach to arbitrary categoires, one arrives to the problem of understanding “weak” sections of a homotopical Grothendieck fibration. We propose a model for such sections, called derived sections, and study the behaviour of homotopical categories of derived sections under the base change functors. The technology developed for the base-change situation is then applied to a specific class of “resolution” base functors, which are inspired by cellular decompositions of classifying spaces. For resolutions, we prove that the inverse image functor on derived sections is homotopically full and faithful. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Categorical resolution; Category theory; Grothendieck fibration; Homotopy theory; Model categories; Simplicial methods,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011002759

Previous research has considered factors such as identity or socioeconomic status that can help people cope with discrimination. However, the literature has not yet considered the ways in which agentic value orientations may moderate the negative effect of discrimination upon well-being. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on the moderating role of openness versus conservation, and self-enhancement versus self-transcendence values as agentic orientations. Analyzing the European Social Survey Round 6 (2012) with multi-level models, this study demonstrates that both individual and national level agentic orientations moderate some of the effects of discrimination on well-being an health. These findings suggest that agentic values are potentially important cognitive resources from which individuals derive strength from when faced with adverse social experiences. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Agency; Cultural differences; Discrimination; Values; Well-being,cognition; cultural identity; modeling; racism; socioeconomic status; survey,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981274718

There is a need to develop approaches for modeling, analysis, improvement and monitoring processes within PAIS. These approaches include process mining techniques used to discover process models from event logs, find log and model deviations, and analyze performance characteristics of processes. The representational bias (a way to model processes) plays an important role in process mining. The BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Model and Notation) standard is widely used and allows to build conventional and understandable process models. In addition to the flat control flow perspective, subprocesses, data flows, resources can be integrated within one BPMN diagram. This makes BPMN very attractive for both process miners and business users, since the control flow perspective can be integrated with data and resource perspectives discovered from event logs. In this paper, we describe and justify robust control flow conversion algorithms, which provide the basis for more advanced BPMN-based discovery and conformance checking algorithms. Thus, on the basis of these conversion algorithms low-level models (such as Petri nets, causal nets and process trees) discovered from event logs using existing approaches can be represented in terms of BPMN. Moreover, we establish behavioral relations between Petri nets and BPMN models and use them to adopt existing conformance checking and performance analysis techniques in order to visualize conformance and performance information within a BPMN diagram. We believe that the results presented in this paper can be used for a wide variety of BPMN mining and conformance checking algorithms. We also provide metrics for the processes discovered before and after the conversion to BPMN structures. Cases for which conversion algorithms produce more compact or more complicated BPMN models in comparison with the initial models are identified. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bisimulation; BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation); Conformance checking; Petri nets; Process discovery; Process mining,Data mining; Petri nets; Robust control; Bisimulations; Business process model; Conformance checking; Process Discovery; Process mining; Algorithms,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944916586

This article provides a review of this research and how our thinking has changed over the years regarding how the brain processes language. In the 19th century, a series of famous case studies linked distinct speech and language functions to specific portions of the left hemisphere of the brain, regions that later came to be known as Broca's and Wernicke's areas. One hundred years later, the emergence of new brain imaging tools allowed for the visualization of brain injuries in vivo that ushered in a new era of brain-behavior research and greatly expanded our understanding of the neural processes of language. Toward the end of the 20th century, sophisticated neuroimaging approaches allowed for the visualization of both structural and functional brain activity associated with language processing in both healthy individuals and in those with language disturbance. More recently, language is thought to be mediated by a much broader expanse of neural networks that covers a large number of cortical and subcortical regions and their interconnecting fiber pathways. Injury to both grey and white matter has been seen to affect the complexities of language in unique ways that have altered how we think about brain-language relationships. The findings that support this paradigm shift are described here along with the methodologies that helped to discover them, with some final thoughts on future directions, techniques, and treatment interventions for those with communication impairments.

Previously, we have found natural antibodies capable of binding to trisaccharide Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc (Pk) practically in all humans. Intriguingly, the same trisaccharide is a key fragment of glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3Cer) – normal component of erythrocyte and endothelial cell membrane, i.e. the antibodies and their cognate antigen coexist without any immunological reaction. Aim To explain the inertness of human anti-Pk antibodies towards own cells. Materials and methods We used a combination of immunochemical and molecular dynamics (MD) experiments. Antibodies were isolated using affinity media with Pk trisaccharide, their epitope specificity was characterized using ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with a set of synthetic glycans related to Pk synthetic glycans and FACS (Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting) analysis of cells with inserted natural Gb3Cer and its synthetic analogue. Conformations and clustering of glycolipids immersed into a lipid bilayer were studied using MD simulations. Results Isolated specific antibodies were completely unable to bind natural Gb3Cer both inserted into cells and in artificial membrane, whereas strong interaction took place with synthetic analogue differing by the presence of a spacer between trisaccharide and lipid part. MD simulations revealed: i) although membrane-bound glycans do not form stable long-living aggregates, their transient packing is more compact in natural Gb3 as compared with the synthetic analog, ii) similar conformation of Pk glycan in composition of the glycolipids, iii) no effect on the mentioned above results when cholesterol was inserted into membrane, and iv) better accessibility of the synthetic version for interaction with proteins.

Thanks to Gaussian process properties we can use both samples generated by a high fidelity function (an expensive and accurate representation of a physical phenomenon) and a low fidelity function (a cheap and coarse approximation of the same physical phenomenon) while constructing a surrogate model. However, if samples sizes are more than few thousands of points, computational costs of the Gaussian process regression become prohibitive both in case of learning and in case of prediction calculation. We propose two approaches to circumvent this computational burden: one approach is based on the Nyström approximation of sample covariance matrices and another is based on an intelligent usage of a blackbox that can evaluate a low fidelity function on the fly at any point of a design space. We examine performance of the proposed approaches using a number of artificial and real problems, including engineering optimization of a rotating disk shape. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Cokriging; Gaussian process regression; Nyström approximation; Variable fidelity data,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017166284

Impaired motor function, and, consequently, the possibility of diagnosing the disease, occur only 20–30 years after the onset of the pathological process with the death of 50–60% of dopaminergic neurons and a decrease in the level of synthesis of dopamine in the striatum by 70–80%. The lack of effective therapy is associated with the late diagnosis of the disease, when there are practically no targets for pharmacotherapy. Therefore, one of the most important priorities of modern neurology is the development of a method for the early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease at the preclinical (asymptomatic) stage. In this work, a new approach was developed to assess the functional deficiency of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system using an inhibitor of dopamine-α-methyl-p-tyrosine synthesis in a chronic model of the preclinical stage of Parkinson’s disease in mice. Administration of α-methyl-p-tyrosine to animals in a model of the preclinical stage of Parkinson’s disease led to the appearance of motor behavior disorders but not in the control group.

In the context of on-going regional to global change, we here aim at identifying and understanding mechanisms behind spatial and temporal variability and trends in the flow of the Selenga River and its tributaries, based on hydrological and meteorological station data (since the 1930s), remote sensing, and statistical analyses. Results show that the flow of the Selenga River exhibits cycles with phases of high flows lasting 12 to 17 years and phases of low flows that historically lasted for about 7 years. However, despite an asynchronous behavior between right-bank tributaries and left-bank tributaries, the flow of the Selenga River near its delta at Lake Baikal has now been low (30% below the 1934–1975 average) for as long as 20 years, due to reduced input from precipitation, particularly during the summer season. Observed decreases in annual maximum hourly flows and decreases in annual minimum 30-day flows are consistent with increasing activation of the groundwater system due to thawing permafrost, and higher winter temperatures that support increased winter flows by preventing rivers to freeze from top to bottom. These recent and relatively large changes have implications for regional water planning and management, including the planned large-scale hydropower expansion in the upper part of the Selenga River Basin. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Climate change; Lake Baikal; Low flow period; Runoff fluctuations; Selenga River,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026779375

It is crucial in these forms of behavior that the serial organization (i.e., order) of both the actions and associated sounds be monitored and learned. To investigate the neural processes involved in the monitoring of serial order during the initial learning of sensorimotor sequences, we performed magnetoencephalographic recordings while participants explicitly learned short piano sequences under the effect of occasional alterations of auditory feedback (AAF). The main result was a prominent and selective modulation of beta (13–30 Hz) oscillations in cingulate and cerebellar regions during the processing of AAF that simulated serial order errors. Furthermore, the AAF-induced modulation of beta oscillations was associated with higher error rates, reflecting compensatory changes in sequence planning. This suggests that cingulate and cerebellar beta oscillations play a role in tracking serial order during initial sensorimotor learning and in updating the mapping of the sensorimotor representations. The findings support the notion that the modulation of beta oscillations is a candidate mechanism for the integration of sequential motor and auditory information during an early stage of skill acquisition in music performance. This has potential implications for singing and speech.

Namely, it addresses the question of how the author’s text is read by the reader and whether the reader interprets the text in the same manner as the author. Fifty-seven scholarly contributions (articles, book chapters and book reviews), written by three social scientists, were content analyzed with the help of the QDA Miner and WordStat computer programs. The outcomes of the qualitative coding were compared with the outcomes of the analysis of word co-occurrences and the outcomes of the analysis on the basis of a dictionary based on substitution. Our findings suggest that texts have plural interpretations. Depending on the reading context, either the author’s or the reader’s perspective prevails. Also, both the author and the reader may read the text in a either deep or perfunctory manner.

In order to check whether the similar mechanisms operate in the Martian magnetotail, we analyzed 80 CS crossings using MAVEN measurements on the nightside of Mars at radial distances ~1.0–2.8R M . We found that CS structures experience similar dependence on the value of the normal component of the magnetic field at the neutral plane (B N ) and on the ratio of the ion drift velocity outside the CS to the thermal velocity (V T /V D ) as it was observed for the CSs in the Earth's magnetotail. For the small values of B N , a thin and intense CS embedded in a thicker one is observed. The half-thickness L of this layer is ~30–100 km ≤ ρ H+ (ρ H+ is a gyroradius of thermal protons outside the CS). With the increase of B N , the L also increases up to several hundred kilometers (~ρ O+ , ρ O2+ ), the current density decreases, and the embedding feature disappears. Our statistical analysis showed a good agreement between L values observed by MAVEN and the CS scaling obtained from the quasi-adiabatic model, if the plasma characteristics in Martian CSs are used as input parameters. Thus, we may conclude that in spite of the differences in magnetic topology, ion composition, and plasma thermal characteristics observed in the Earth's and Martian magnetotails, similar quasi-adiabatic mechanisms contribute to the formation of the CSs in the magnetotails of both planets. ©2017.

Then, we discuss a recent computational proposal that the progression to addiction is unlikely to result from a complete withdrawal of the goal-oriented decision system in favor the habitual one. Rather, the transition to addiction would arise from a drug-induced alteration in the structure of organismal needs which reorganizes the goal structure, ultimately favoring predominance of drug-oriented goals.

To help elucidate the biological underpinnings of these prevalent disorders, we previously examined the relationship between components of anxiety (somatic, psychic and motoric) and serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT 1A ) binding in MDD and found that higher psychic and lower somatic anxiety was associated with greater 5-HT 1A binding. In this work, we sought to examine the correlation between these anxiety symptom dimensions and 5-HTT binding. Positron emission tomography with [ 11 C]-3-amino-4-(3-dimethylamino-methylphenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile ([ 11 C]DASB) and a metabolite-corrected arterial input function were used to estimate regional 5-HTT binding in 55 subjects with MDD and anxiety symptoms. Somatic anxiety was negatively correlated with 5-HTT binding in the thalamus (β=−.33, p=.025), amygdala (β=−.31, p=.007) and midbrain (β=−.72, p&lt;.001). Psychic anxiety was positively correlated with 5-HTT binding in midbrain only (β=.46, p=.0025). To relate to our previous study, correlation between 5-HT 1A and 5-HTT binding was examined, and none was found. We also examined how much of the variance in anxiety symptom dimensions could be explained by both 5-HTT and 5-HT 1A binding. The developed model was able to explain 68% (p&lt;.001), 38% (p=.012) and 32% (p=.038) of the total variance in somatic, psychic, and motoric anxiety, respectively. Results indicate the tight coupling between the serotonergic system and anxiety components, which may be confounded when using aggregate anxiety measures. Uncovering serotonin's role in anxiety and depression in this way may give way to a new generation of therapeutics and treatment strategies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP",Anxiety; Depression; Positron emission tomography; Serotonin,"3 amino 4 (3 dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)benzonitrile c 11; antidepressant agent; carbon 11; n [2 [4 (2 methoxyphenyl) 1 piperazinyl]ethyl] n (2 pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide; n [2 [4 (2 methoxyphenyl) 1 piperazinyl]ethyl] n (2 pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide c 11; serotonin; serotonin 1A receptor; serotonin transporter; tracer; unclassified drug; benzylamine derivative; carbon; HTR1A protein, human; N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio)benzylamine; N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide; piperazine derivative; pyridine derivative; radiopharmaceutical agent; serotonin; serotonin 1A receptor; serotonin transporter; SLC6A4 protein, human; adult; amygdala; anterior cingulate; anxiety; Article; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; gray matter; hippocampus; human; major clinical study; major depression; male; mesencephalon; outcome assessment; positron emission tomography; priority journal; putamen; radiochemistry; raphe nucleus; receptor binding; serotoninergic system; symptom assessment; thalamus; adolescent; anxiety; brain; brain mapping; comorbidity; complication; diagnostic imaging; major depression; metabolism; middle aged; psychology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Benzylamines; Brain; Brain Mapping; Carbon Radioisotopes; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Piperazines; Positron-Emission Tomography; Pyridines; Radiopharmaceuticals; Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A; Serotonin; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Young Adult",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028352980

Compulsory schooling has always relied on the Panoptic schema described by Michel Foucault. In recent decades, the development of surveillance technologies has made Panoptic schemas in schools even stronger. Information technology and the transition to an information society has significantly undermined schools' power structures. Teachers no longer possess a monopoly on knowledge. Students have learned to escape the teachers' gaze and can lead virtual lives through their own smartphones inside and outside formal educational settings. One form of modern peer-to-peer interaction takes place on social networking websites that give users the option to be 'hidden', 'passive' or 'inactive' if they wish. To examine the influence of social networking on education we rely on the Foucault's Panopticon theory. Whilst the traditional Panoptic regime may be crumbling, the social network phenomenon can transform modern learning environments for productive educational engagement. Foucault's framework does not take into account the social networks phenomenon. Therefore, empirical evidence is required to articulate the nuances of the modern-day Panopticon. In this chapter we use interviews with teachers to illustrate the reflection of Panoptic logics and practices onto the social networks in classrooms. We explore the possibility for developing dialogically based and student-led pedagogies through social networking websites. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

Carrier generation in a time-of-flight (TOF) experiment was achieved through direct ionization of dopant molecules by electron impact using an electron gun supplying pulses of monoenergetic electrons in the range of 2–50 keV. The position of dopant ionization depends upon the electron energy and three TOF variants have been recently developed and used in this study. We have found that the hole mobility generally decreased with increasing film thickness with concomitant acceleration of the post-flight current decay indicating that the transport process approaches the steady-state regime, this process happening slightly faster than our model predicts.

The Hamiltonian is inherently related to the Bose-Hubbard model for vector two-species bosons in optical lattices. We show that such a model can be reduced to the Kugel-Khomskii type spin-pseudospin model, but in contrast to the usual version of the latter model, we are dealing here with the case of spin S=1 and pseudospin 1/2. We show that the interplay of spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom leads to a rather nontrivial magnetic phase diagram including the spin-nematic configurations. Tuning the spin-channel interaction parameter Us gives rise to quantum phase transitions. We find that the ground state of the system always has the pseudospin domain structure. On the other hand, the sign change of Us switches the spin arrangement of the ground state within domains from a ferro- to antiferromagnetic one.

Employing a wide range of data sources, the authors show that in Russia, the primary risk of orphan? hood remains high. Although it has declined over the last fifteen years, in 2015, the share of children taken out of parental care exceeded two percent of the total number of children under eighteen. At the same time, statistical data confirms the ongoing deinstitualisation of the Russian care system, a trend that has continued since the mid-2000s. Thus, 11.5 % of children out of parental care were institutionalised in 2014, whereas in 2000 this share amounted to as much as 27 %. However, the authors argue that the current childcare system reproduces a number of serious systemic problems. Firstly, despite the fact that over 80 % of children entering the Russian care system per year have living parents, reuniting the children with the birth family is not yet recognised as a primary objective of the policy; according to the official statistics, only one out of ten children goes back home after being taken out of parental care. Secondly, for particular groups of children it is often hard to arrange family placements. Until now, the higher risks of long? term institutionalisation are noticeable in children placed out of parental care at the age of three years or older. This problem is particularly serious for teenagers, as well as for children with physical or mental disabilities. Thirdly, the prevalence and dynamics in children returning to institutions from foster placements highlight the importance of professional training for foster parents and the need for consistent guidance for foster families, aspects that are still underdeveloped in Russia. In the last section of the paper, authors discuss one possible outcome of this analysis with reference to policies aimed at children left out of parental care. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.",Children out of parental care; Deinstitutionalisation of orphan care; Foster families; Institutional placements for orphan children; Russia; Social orphanage; Statistics,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029904020

However, little is known about the underlying action mechanisms of this technique because of the AC-induced artifacts on Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Here we show a unique approach to investigate online physiological frequency-specific effects of tACS of the primary motor cortex (M1) by using single pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to probe cortical excitability changes. In our setup, the TMS coil is placed over the tACS electrode while Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) are collected to test the effects of the ongoing M1-tACS. So far, this approach has mainly been used to study the visual and motor systems. However, the current tACS-TMS setup can pave the way for future investigations of cognitive functions.

The two currents interlaced in the project of Korean autonomy in a post-imperial state, first the Far Eastern Republic and later the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics. The project involved inclusion of Koreans into the global spread of revolution through the Communist International and left open the issue of the duration of Korean presence in the Russian Far East. Its ultimate failure in 1926 left the Koreans partly excluded from the Soviet system without the institutional benefits of national autonomy. © 2017 Association for the Study of Nationalities.",autonomy; empire; Korea; nationalism; Russian Far East,autonomy; communism; government; nationalism; political history; popular protest; Korea; Russian Far East; Russian Federation,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020163749

It contradicts the expectations of power transition theory, which sees rising powers as the most likely challengers. This article tries to tackle this puzzle by examining the two states' relative positions in the international system. China can grow and prosper by free-riding on the hegemonic order established by the United States, and is thus cautious about challenging it. As a declining power, Russia is dissatisfied with the order and determined to change it to reverse its decline and maintain its great power status. For the time being, the two great powers' interests align. China uses Russia to push back against the aspects of US hegemony it dislikes (thereby avoiding the costs of a direct challenge), while Russia needs China's backing to mount its challenge. However, going forward, the same structural dynamics that now favour the relationship may work against it: should Russia's challenge start to destabilize the system it may also jeopardize China's peaceful rise, causing rifts between the two powers. New US president Donald Trump has promised to seek a tougher line towards China and a rapprochement with Russia. However, given its strong structural foundations these policies are unlikely to weaken the China-Russia partnership, and could even strengthen it. © The Author 2017.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044720536

Nonetheless, research on the life satisfaction of Russian seniors and its determinants is still rather scarce. Thus, identifying the factors of life satisfaction in old age could enable the development of a sound state policy towards the elderly and enhance the well-being of society as a whole. This paper explores the determinants of older adults’ life satisfaction using cross-sectional and panel data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS-HSE). Our research shows that for all Russian seniors (females over the age of 55 and males over the age of 60), the strongest and most common correlates of life satisfaction are: marital status, health status, social status, and personal income. We found significant gender differences in the factors of life satisfaction: an inverse U-shaped relation of age and life satisfaction is characteristic for the oldest females only; having a job and having a higher education enhances life satisfaction for women but not for men. The type of settlement and parental status have no correlation with seniors’ life satisfaction. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Aging; Life satisfaction; Older adults; RLMS-HSE; Russia,adult; aging; education; female; health status; human; human experiment; life satisfaction; male; marriage; middle aged; monitoring; personal income; Russian (citizen); sex difference; social status,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022038943

In a world where political talk is often ambiguous and imprecise, it then becomes important to understand whether correct choices can still be made. In this paper we identify two elements of political culture that are key to answering this question: (i) whether or not political statements satisfy a so-called “grain of truth” assumption, and (ii) whether or not politicians make statements that are comparative, that is contain information about politicians’ own positions relative to that of their adversaries. The “grain of truth” assumption means that statements, even if vague, do not completely misrepresent the true positions of the parties. We find that only when political campaigning is comparative and has a grain of truth, will voters always make choices as if they were fully informed. Therefore, the imprecision of political statements should not be a problem as long as comparative campaigning is in place. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Asymmetric information; Comparative campaigning; Information disclosure; Political competition; Voting,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019720867

We propose a new neural network model that uses an input set of facial images of a person to produce a compact, fixed-dimension descriptor. Our model is composed of two modules. The feature embedding module maps each image onto a feature vector, while the face quality assessment module estimates the utility of each facial image. These feature vectors are weighted based on their utility estimations, resulting in the image set feature representation. During visual analysis we found that our model learns to use more information from high-quality face images and less information from blurred or occluded images.

The change in the synthesis of noradrenaline in the central and peripheral organs when its synthesis in the brains of neonatal rats is switched off was considered as one of the mechanisms of such interaction. For this purpose, the level of gene expression and the content of enzymes involved in the synthesis of noradrenaline—tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH)—was determined in the brain, adrenal glands, and the organ of Zuckerkandl. The synthesis of noradrenaline after destruction of noradrenergic neurons was switched off by injecting anti-DBH-saporin-antibodies against dopamine-β-hydroxylase conjugated to the cytotoxin saporin into the cerebral ventricles of neonatal rats. The content of TH and DBH mRNA in organs was determined by realtime PCR, and the protein content of enzymes was determined by Western blotting. It is shown that, 48 h after switching off the synthesis of noradrenaline in the brain of 2-day-old animals, a sharp increase in TH and DBH mRNA content in adrenal glands and the organ of Zuckerkandl was observed, although the content of both enzymes was retained at the control level.

The domain of wave vectors at the starting point for which the wave amplification factors at the output of the density cavity reach their maximum values is found, and the amplification factor as a function of the wave frequency is determined. It is shown that the longitudinal velocity of fast electrons, which enables generation of waves in a broader frequency range, plays an important role in the formation of the spectrum of the auroral kilometric radiation (AKR). In this case, waves with the largest amplification factors at the output of the cavity have frequencies exceeding the cutoff frequency of the background plasma at the wave generation altitude. The global inhomogeneity of the magnetic field and plasma density, which governs the residence time of the waves in the amplification region, plays a key role in the formation of the AKR spectrum.

Hence it is interesting to study the spatial structure and plasma characteristics of such “oxygen” CSs. MAVEN spacecraft (s/c) currently operating on the Martian orbit with a unique set of scientific instruments allows observation of the magnetic field and three-dimensional distribution functions of various ion components and electrons with a high time resolution.

We analyse the spatial structure of the CSs and estimate their thickness for different magnetic configurations and relative abundance of the heavy and light ions in the sheets. It is shown that, similarly to the CSs in the Earth’s magnetotail, the thickness and complexity of the spatial structure of the Maritan CSs (i.e. the presence of embedded and / or peripheral current structures) depend on the magnetic configuration of the sheets, which, in turn, affects the fraction of the quasi-adiabatic particles in the CSs. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",current sheets; Mars magnetosphere; quasi-adiabatic ion dynamics,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029742076

This paper fills this gap: it addresses equity issues related to the provision of home care services across three macro areas in Europe that are highly heterogeneous in terms of the degree of public financing of LTC and the strength and social value of family ties. Using cross-country comparative microdata from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we estimate and decompose an Erreygers concentration index of the use of both paid domestic help (‘unskilled’ care) and personal nursing care (‘skilled’ care), measuring the contribution of income, need and non-need factors to overall inequality. We base the decomposition on a bivariate probit model that takes into account the interaction between formal and informal home care use. We find higher inequities in the use of unskilled home care in areas where public financing of LTC is relatively low (‘Southern Europe’) than in areas where the public–private mix of financing is more balanced (‘Continental Europe’). At the same time, we do not detect inequity in ‘Northern Europe’, which is characterised by high public spending on universal, equitable services, including LTC public coverage. In all areas, we find informal care is a substitute for paid unskilled care among the poor, and this contributes to further skewing of the distribution of the use of formal care services towards the rich.

We introduce the class of Semi-FIFO policies that decouple processing order from transmission order, restricting the latter to First-In-First-Out (FIFO). We build a taxonomy of Semi-FIFO policies and provide worst case guarantees for different processing orders. We consider various special cases and properties of Semi-FIFO policies: greedy, work-conserving, lazy, and push-out policies, and show how these properties affect performance.

However, untangling the neuronal mechanisms that subserve these baseline alterations requires measurement of their electrophysiological underpinnings. This systematic review specifically investigates the contributions of resting-state Magnetoencephalography (MEG) in elucidating abnormal neural organization in SZ patients. Method A systematic literature review of resting-state MEG studies in SZ was conducted. This literature is discussed in relation to findings from resting-state fMRI and EEG, as well as to task-based MEG research in SZ population. Importantly, methodological limitations are considered and recommendations to overcome current limitations are proposed. Results Resting-state MEG literature in SZ points towards altered local and long-range oscillatory network dynamics in various frequency bands. Critical methodological challenges with respect to experiment design, and data collection and analysis need to be taken into consideration. Conclusion Spontaneous MEG data show that local and global neural organization is altered in SZ patients. MEG is a highly promising tool to fill in knowledge gaps about the neurophysiology of SZ. However, to reach its fullest potential, basic methodological challenges need to be overcome.

At the same time, the question about their full equivalence to the native analogues remains unanswered. To gain additional insight into this problem, intimate atomistic details of a relatively simple protein, small and structurally rigid recombinant cardiotoxin I (CTI) from cobra Naja oxiana venom, were characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in water. Compared to the natural protein, it contains an additional Met residue at the N-terminus. In this work, the NMR-derived spatial structure of uniformly 13 C- and 15 N-labeled CTI and its dynamic behavior were investigated and subjected to comparative analysis with the corresponding data for the native toxin. The differences were found in dihedral angles of only a single residue, adjacent to the N-terminal methionine. Microsecond-long MD traces of the toxins reveal an increased flexibility in the residues spatially close to the N-Met. As the detected structural and dynamic changes of the two CTI models do not result in substantial differences in their cytotoxicities, we assume that the recombinant protein can be used for many purposes as a reasonable surrogate of the native one. In addition, we discuss general features of the spatial organization of cytotoxins, implied by the results of the current combined NMR and MD study. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,Amino acids; Dihedral angle; Gene encoding; Molecular dynamics; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Proteins; Atomistic molecular dynamics; Biotechnological applications; Comparative analysis; Dynamic behaviors; Increased flexibility; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Spatial organization; Spatial structure; Recombinant proteins; cytotoxin; cytotoxin I; methionine; recombinant protein; snake venom; unclassified drug; water; cobra cytotoxin I; recombinant protein; amino terminal sequence; Article; atom; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; cytotoxicity; hydrogen bond; molecular dynamics; Naja; Naja oxiana; nitrogen nuclear magnetic resonance; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; structure analysis; toxin structure; animal; chemistry; Elapidae; genetics; metabolism; protein domain; Animals; Elapid Venoms; Elapidae; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Protein Domains; Recombinant Proteins,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028532261

We derive a nonperturbative expression for the local electron DOS in superconducting nanowires which fully accounts for quantum phase fluctuations. At any nonzero temperature these fluctuations smear out the square-root singularity in DOS near the superconducting gap and generate quasiparticle states at subgap energies.

Up to now, the relation between the phases of neuronal oscillations and behavior or perception has mainly been analyzed in sensor space of multivariate EEG/MEG recordings. However, sensor-space analysis distorts the topographies of the underlying neuronal sources and suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio. Instead, we propose an optimized source reconstruction approach (Phase Coupling Optimization, PCO). Methods PCO maximizes the ‘mean vector length’, calculated from the phases of recovered neuronal sources and a target variable of interest (e.g., experimental performance). As pre-processing, the signal-to-noise ratio in the search-space is maximized by spatio-spectral decomposition. PCO was benchmarked against several competing algorithms and sensor-space analysis using realistic forward model simulations. As a practical example, thirteen 96-channel EEG measurements during a simple reaction time task were analyzed. After time-frequency decomposition, PCO was applied to the EEG to examine the relation between the phases of pre-stimulus EEG activity and reaction times. Results In simulations, PCO outperformed other spatial optimization approaches and sensor-space analysis. Scalp topographies of the underlying source patterns and the relation between the phases of the source activity and the target variable could be reconstructed accurately even for very low SNRs (−10 dB). In a simple reaction time experiment, the phases of pre-stimulus delta waves (<0.1 Hz) with widely distributed fronto-parietal source topographies were found predictive of the reaction times. Discussion and conclusions From multivariate recordings, PCO can reconstruct neuronal sources that are phase-coupled to a target variable using a data-driven optimization approach. Its superiority has been shown in simulations and in the analysis of a simple reaction time experiment. From this data, we hypothesize that the phase entrainment of slow delta waves (<1 Hz) facilitates sensorimotor integration in the brain and that this mechanism underlies the faster processing of anticipated stimuli. We further propose that the examined slow delta waves, observed to be phase-coupled to reaction times, correspond to the compound potentials typically observed in paradigms of stimulus anticipation and motor preparation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",EEG; Neuronal oscillations; Optimization; Phase coupling; Reaction times; Spatial filtering,"accuracy; algorithm; Article; computer prediction; electroencephalogram; neurophysiology; priority journal; process optimization; reaction time; sensitivity analysis; sensorimotor integration; signal noise ratio; adult; algorithm; computer simulation; electroencephalography phase synchronization; electromyography; electrostimulation; human; physiology; psychomotor performance; signal processing; Adult; Algorithms; Brain Waves; Computer Simulation; Electric Stimulation; Electroencephalography Phase Synchronization; Electromyography; Humans; Psychomotor Performance; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020885737

Consisting of two subscales, Consistency of Interests (CI) and Perseverance of Effort (PE), this scale has been repeatedly demonstrated to have high reliability and validity. At the same time, an increasing number of studies explicitly report a low correlation between the subscales and distinct patterns of associations with external measures that each subscale forms. We explored whether there is psychometric evidence that a substantive single grit construct underlies the scale. To answer this question, we investigated the scale structure in a more robust framework than the classical test theory and factor analyses could previously provide. The Russian version of the Grit scale was developed and implemented on a representative sample of high school students (n = 2,269), and different models of item response theory (IRT), both unidimensional and multidimensional, were compared to find the best fitting model. The results confirmed that the subscales reflect related but independent constructs rather than the whole grit construct. The psychometric properties of the subscales were analyzed with the two-dimensional Partial Credit Model. Both subscales of the Russian version of the Grit scale are unidimensional, have good psychometric properties, and can be used to estimate respondents' ability. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",construct validity; dimensionality; grit scale; IRT,,English,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047502541

One particular problem in this regard is that datasets of anonymised records currently not covered under personal data laws (because they do not identify individuals) can, in fact, be used to identify data subjects (the individuals to whom the data refers) when combined and analysed using Big Data tools. Furthermore, existing sanctions for misuse of personal data are minor, and often fail to act as a deterrent when the commercial benefits of exploiting user data (e.g. through targeted advertising) are so much greater.

In the present paper, we analyze violation of multipartite Bell inequalities via the local probability model—the LqHV (local quasi hidden variable) model (Loubenets in J Math Phys 53:022201, 2012), incorporating the LHV model only as a particular case and correctly reproducing the probabilistic description of every quantum correlation scenario, more generally, every nonsignaling scenario. The LqHV probability framework allows us to construct nonsignaling analogs of Bell inequalities and to specify parameters quantifying violation of Bell inequalities—Bell’s nonlocality—in a general nonsignaling case. For quantum correlation scenarios on an N-qudit state, we evaluate these nonlocality parameters analytically in terms of dilation characteristics of an N-qudit state and also, numerically—in d and N. In view of our rigorous mathematical description of Bell’s nonlocality in a general nonsignaling case via the local probability model, we argue that violation of Bell inequalities in a quantum case is not due to violation of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) locality conjectured by Bell but due to the improper HV modelling of “quantum realism”. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Bell’s nonlocality; Nonsignaling; Quantum realism; The LqHV modelling,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014513795

I am going to contend with this opinion, namely, with a part of it telling that the prevailing mass of the people strives to achieve more freedom and enlightenment. On the opposite, freedom, individual independence, and political rights (not to be confused with social rights, such as state care and protection) are of minor importance to the mass. The ideology of liberalism in its classical form, as created by John Locke, Immanuel Kant, John Stuart Mill and others, yields to the pressure of the ideology of state paternalism. The pressure comes not only from above (that is, from authorities); the people also welcome more paternalism. They appear not to value their individual freedom and independence, and they are inclined to give them up voluntarily to some mighty organization such as the state in exchange for care, protection and leadership. Liberalism has played an important role in the development of human civilization and the formation of the Western world, but new ideologies and political practices are pushing it out of people’s minds. For the author, as adherent of classical liberalism, this is unfortunate. However, I wish to treat this issue realistically, even if the facts conflict with my own convictions and desires. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Clash of cultures; Classical liberalism; Human nature; Islamic spring; Refugees; State paternalism,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994141210

Both notions (‘simple’ and ‘typical’) are defined in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. It is known that this cannot be achieved for some objects: there are some “non-stochastic” objects that do not have good explanations. In this paper we study the properties of maximally non-stochastic objects; we call them “antistochastic”. In this paper, we demonstrate that the antistochastic strings have the following property (Theorem 6): if an antistochastic string x has complexity k, then any k bit of information about x are enough to reconstruct x (with logarithmic advice). In particular, if we erase all but k bits of this antistochastic string, the erased bits can be restored from the remaining ones (with logarithmic advice). As a corollary we get the existence of good list-decoding codes with erasures (or other ways of deleting part of the information). Antistochastic strings can also be used as a source of counterexamples in algorithmic information theory. We show that the symmetry of information property fails for total conditional complexity for antistochastic strings.

Drawing on an exhaustive sample of 258 academic publications from 1990-2014, this paper provides a comprehensive review of strategic foresight and its influence on innovation. Our review suggest that strategic foresight rather than directly resulting in innovation tend to rather influence it by shaping and giving form to innovation management tools, and future-oriented knowledge creation, which in turn cumulatively drive innovation performance.

Previous research found that structural priming is reliably enhanced when lexical content is repeated (lexical boost effect). A widely held assumption is that structure-licensing heads enjoy a privileged role in lexically boosting structural priming. The present comprehension-to-production priming experiments investigated whether head-constituents (verbs) versus non-head constituents (argument nouns) contribute differently to boosting ditransitive structure priming in English. Experiment 1 showed that lexical boosts from repeated agent or recipient nouns (and to a lesser extent, repeated theme nouns) were comparable to those from repeated verbs. Experiments 2 and 3 found that increasing numbers of content words shared between primes and targets led to increasing magnitudes of structural priming (again, with no ‘special’ contribution of verb-repetition). We conclude that lexical boost effects are not diagnostic of lexically-specific syntactic representations, even though such representations are supported by other types of evidence. © 2017",Lexical boost; Sentence production; Syntactic priming,comprehension; controlled study; head; human; human experiment; licensing; recipient,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015768632

Not many years passed, however, before the critique of social inequalities and capitalism was once again a main protest theme of social movements. This book provides an account of radical left movements in today's Europe and how they are trying to accomplish social and political change. The book's international group of leading experts provide detailed analysis on social movement organizations, activist groups, and networks that are rooted in the left-wing ideologies of anarchism, Marxism, socialism, and communism in both newly democratized post-communist and longstanding liberal-democratic polities. Through a range of case studies, the authors explore how radical left movements are influenced by their situated political and social contexts, and how contemporary radical left activism differs from both new and old social movements on one hand, and the activities of radical left parliamentary parties on the other. Ultimately, this volume investigates what it means to be 'radical left' in current day liberal-democratic and capitalist societies after the fall of European state socialism.

It was also shown that values of the diffusion coefficients for displacements parallel and perpendicular to the major axis of a uniformly wetting particle agree well with analytical predictions despite a finite slip at the particle surface present in MD simulations. It was further demonstrated that diffusion of Janus particles is markedly different from that of uniform particles; namely, Janus particles preferentially rotate and orient their nonwetting ends along the displacement vector to reduce drag.

To each such a variety one can assign a numerical sequence called a sequence of codimensions. The n-th codimension is equal to the dimension of the vector space of all n-linear operations in the free algebra of the variety. In recent decades, a new approach to such a sequence has appeared based on the fact that the union of the above vector spaces carries the structure of algebraic operad, so that the generating function of the codimension sequence is equal to the generating series of the operad. We show that in general there does not exist an algorithm to decide whether the growth exponent of the codimension sequence of the variety defined by given finite sets of operations and identities is equal to a given rational number. In particular, we solve negatively a recent conjecture by Bremner and Dotsenko by showing that the set of codimension sequences of varieties defined by a bounded number and degrees of operations and identities is infinite. Then we discuss algorithms which in many cases calculate the generating functions of the codimension series in the form of a defining algebraic or differential equation. For a more general class of varieties, these algorithms give upper and lower bounds for the codimensions in terms of generating functions. The upper bound is just a formal power series satisfying an algebraic equation defined effectively by the generators and the identities of the variety. The first stage of an algorithm for the lower bound is the construction of a Groebner basis of the operad. If the Groebner basis happens to be finite and satisfies mild restrictions, a recent theorem by the author and Anton Khoroshkin guarantees that the desired generating function is either algebraic or differential algebraic. We describe algorithms producing such equations. In the case of infinite Groebner basis, these algorithms applied to its finite subsets give lower bounds for the generating function of the codimension sequence. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Algebraic equation; Codimension series; Differential algebraic equation; Generating series; Groebner bases in operads; Growth in operads; Operad,Computation theory; Differential equations; Vector spaces; Algebraic equations; Codimension; Differential algebraic equations; Generating series; Groebner basis; Operad; Algebra,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027710780

Recent neurophysiological research on word form acquisition in adults indicates that novel words can be acquired within minutes of repetitive exposure to them, regardless of the individual's focused attention on the speech input. Although it is well-known that children surpass adults in language acquisition, the developmental aspects of such rapid and automatic neural acquisition mechanisms remain unexplored. To address this open question, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to scrutinise brain dynamics elicited by spoken words and word-like sounds in healthy monolingual (Danish) children throughout a 20-min repetitive passive exposure session. We found rapid neural dynamics manifested as an enhancement of early (~100 ms) brain activity over the short exposure session, with distinct spatiotemporal patterns for different novel sounds. For novel Danish word forms, signs of such enhancement were seen in the left temporal regions only, suggesting reliance on pre-existing language circuits for acquisition of novel word forms with native phonology. In contrast, exposure both to novel word forms with non-native phonology and to novel non-speech sounds led to activity enhancement in both left and right hemispheres, suggesting that more wide-spread cortical networks contribute to the build-up of memory traces for non-native and non-speech sounds. Similar studies in adults have previously reported more sluggish (~15–25 min, as opposed to 4 min in the present study) or non-existent neural dynamics for non-native sound acquisition, which might be indicative of a higher degree of plasticity in the children's brain. Overall, the results indicate a rapid and highly plastic mechanism for a dynamic build-up of memory traces for novel acoustic information in the children's brain that operates automatically and recruits bilateral temporal cortical circuits. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Children; Development; ERF; Language; Learning; MEG,"adult; Article; auditory response; auditory stimulation; brain cortex; child; connectome; Danish citizen; female; human; language ability; language processing; left hemisphere; magnetoencephalography; male; memory consolidation; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; neuroimaging; neurophysiology; phonetics; preschool child; priority journal; right hemisphere; spatiotemporal analysis; speech articulation; temporal cortex; temporal lobe; verbal memory; brain cortex; child development; language; learning; magnetoencephalography; physiology; procedures; speech perception; time factor; Cerebral Cortex; Child; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Language; Learning; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Speech Perception; Time Factors",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017508954

They are thought to be involved in timing and synchronization through fast feedforward control of principal neurons. Theoretical studies have shown, however, that whereas self-inhibition does indeed reduce response duration, lateral inhibition, in contrast, may generate slow response components through a process of gradual disinhibition. Here we simulated a circuit of interneurons (stellate and basket cells) of the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex and observed circuit time constants that could rise, depending on parameter values, to &gt;1 s. The integration time scaled both with the strength of inhibition, vanishing completely when inhibition was blocked, and with the average connection distance, which determined the balance between lateral and self-inhibition. Electrical synapses could further enhance the integration time by limiting heterogeneity among the interneurons and by introducing a slow capacitive current. The model can explain several observations, such as the slow time course of OFF-beam inhibition, the phase lag of interneurons during vestibular rotation, or the phase lead of Purkinje cells. Interestingly, the interneuron spike trains displayed power that scaled approximately as 1/f at low frequencies. In conclusion, stellate and basket cells in cerebellar cortex, and interneuron circuits in general, may not only provide fast inhibition to principal cells but also act as temporal integrators that build a very short-term memory. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY The most common function attributed to inhibitory interneurons is feedforward control of principal neurons. In many brain regions, however, the interneurons are densely interconnected via both chemical and electrical synapses but the function of this coupling is largely unknown. Based on large-scale simulations of an interneuron circuit of cerebellar cortex, we propose that this coupling enhances the integration time constant, and hence the memory trace, of the circuit. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.",Basket cell; Cerebellum; Computational model; Integrator; Lateral inhibition; Stellate cell,"adult; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; basket cell; cell heterogeneity; cerebellum cortex; connectome; controlled study; electrical synapse; interneuron; nerve cell inhibition; nonhuman; priority journal; Purkinje cell; rat; spike; stellate cell; animal; biological model; cat; cerebellum; cytology; electrostimulation; guinea pig; interneuron; membrane potential; metabolism; mouse; physiology; synapse; time factor; ion channel; neurotransmitter receptor; Animals; Cats; Cerebellum; Electric Stimulation; Electrical Synapses; Guinea Pigs; Interneurons; Ion Channels; Membrane Potentials; Mice; Models, Neurological; Neural Inhibition; Rats; Receptors, Neurotransmitter; Synapses; Time Factors",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024093383

We show that spectral densities of corresponding adjacency matrices demonstrate peculiar ultrametric structure inherent to sparse systems. In particular, the tails of the distribution for binary trees share the 'Lifshitz singularity' emerging in the one-dimensional localization, while the spectral statistics of p-branching star-like graphs is less universal, being strongly dependent on p. The hierarchical structure of spectra of adjacency matrices is interpreted as sets of resonance frequencies, that emerge in ensembles of fully branched tree-like systems, known as dendrimers. However, the relaxational spectrum is not determined by the cluster topology, but has rather the number-theoretic origin, reflecting the peculiarities of the rare-event statistics typical for one-dimensional systems with a quenched structural disorder. The similarity of spectral densities of an individual dendrimer and of an ensemble of linear chains with exponential distribution in lengths, demonstrates that dendrimers could be served as simple disorder-less toy models of one-dimensional systems with quenched disorder. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.",Anderson model; networks; random graphs; random/ordered microstructure,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026765797

The sample size was 3803 users with 785066 posts in total for the half-year period; training dataset included 75% of the sample, the rest 25% were used as test dataset. The data-based structure represented slightly better quality scores, while prediction quality was almost the same: 90.5% accuracy for model with expert-based structure and 89.6% accuracy for data-based model.

METHODS: We analyzed data from 68.5 million persons to assess the trends in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adults between 1980 and 2015. Using the Global Burden of Disease study data and methods, we also quantified the burden of disease related to high body-mass index (BMI), according to age, sex, cause, and BMI in 195 countries between 1990 and 2015. RESULTS: In 2015, a total of 107.7 million children and 603.7 million adults were obese. Since 1980, the prevalence of obesity has doubled in more than 70 countries and has continuously increased in most other countries. Although the prevalence of obesity among children has been lower than that among adults, the rate of increase in childhood obesity in many countries has been greater than the rate of increase in adult obesity. High BMI accounted for 4.0 million deaths globally, nearly 40% of which occurred in persons who were not obese. More than two thirds of deaths related to high BMI were due to cardiovascular disease. The disease burden related to high BMI has increased since 1990; however, the rate of this increase has been attenuated owing to decreases in underlying rates of death from cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid increase in the prevalence and disease burden of elevated BMI highlights the need for continued focus on surveillance of BMI and identification, implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based interventions to address this problem.

The philosopher believed that its sources were “demons” living in the Russian national spirit, discovered and awakened in the works of the Russian classics, such as Nikolai Gogol, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and Leo Tolstoy. The main reason these demons were able to take hold of the Russian national consciousness was the collapse of everyday life, and the false orientation of this consciousness toward a violent establishment of a new social order. This order attempted to create a moral of equality and fair distribution of property, while lacking a religious-metaphysical foundation. Berdyaev s views are compared with the contemporary realities in Russia at the time and the search for a resolution to the deep sociopolitical and moral contradictions inherent in these realities. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Nikolai Berdyaev; Religious-metaphysical foundation of life philosophy of freedom; Russian revolution; Spirituality,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031492793

The findings provide a decision base for policy-makers to improve the technology base and to ease the reliance on technology imports.

Previous research showed that technology transfer into Russian agricultural enterprises suffers from a low knowledge level especially in receiving organizations.

Such events are possible only in the context of Modernity, just as Modernity itself persists until and to the extent that it bears the imprint of these events, both in its institutional organization and in its historical memory (as a belief in the feasibility of an alternative to existing structures of domination, and not as an homage to the “museum of revolution,” which fixes it in a “glorious” but lifeless past). © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Causation through freedom; Event; Event subject; Modernity; Ontology of the unpredictability of revolutions; Revolution,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031491480

However, reform of systems of vocational education and training (VET) poses severe challenges for aligning the interests of schools, firms, households, and governments, even in societies with relatively efficient markets for labor and education. Where market institutions are poorly developed, these challenges are particularly acute, resulting in endemic mismatches between the supply and demand of skill. Currently governments in many countries, including the United States, Russia, and China, are seeking to adopt elements of the German dual education model. The Russian federal government has undertaken several initiatives designed to upgrade VET by encouraging closer cooperation of vocational schools and firms at the regional level, including the adoption of dual education programs. This paper focuses on one such project: a 2013 pilot program administered by the Russian Agency for Strategic Initiatives, to foster the development of new models of dual education. The paper compares the 13 pilot regions with regions that submitted proposals but were not selected and with all other regions along multiple economic, social, demographic, and institutional dimensions. The findings suggest hypotheses about the conditions that enabled the pilot regions to take advantage of federal policies encouraging the adoption of dual education. More generally, the paper sheds light on institutional solutions to collective action dilemmas in skill formation in transitional and developing societies. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",collective dilemmas; coordinated and liberal market economies; Russian Federation; skill formation; vocational education and training (VET),education policy; education reform; skilled labor; vocational education; Russian Federation,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014535503

Specifically, it argues that Russian exhibits three single meta-comparatives (skoree ‘sooner’, bol′še ‘more’, and lučše ‘better’, lit.), which are derived as a result of grammaticalisation of corresponding standard comparatives and three double meta-comparatives (skoree bol′še, bol′še skoree, and skoree lučše). From a morphological and syntactic point of view, these meta-comparatives are quite distinct from standard comparatives. Unlike standard comparatives, they have only synthetic forms, are ungrammatical with Genitive and show prosodic restrictions and linearly syntactic preferences. Moreover, the meta-comparatives are divided into two major groups: skoree, bol′še, skoree bol′še, bol′še skoree vs. lučše, skoree lučše. Each of these two groups imposes specific restrictions on a syntactic category and/or grammatical form of the two compared phrases. Last but not least, due to a relatively free combination of skoree with other single meta-comparatives, which results in double meta-comparatives, the paper reveals that skoree is the most grammaticalised meta-comparative in Russian.

For this reason, the metaphors of evil in Psalm 1, which also emphasizes the rejection of evil, are instrumental to the analysis of Bulgakov’s text. The particular focus of the paper is the Moscow writers familiar with the Eršalaim story. This narrative functions as the ultimate artistic truth in the novel, and the knowledge of it compels the characters to abandon their involvement in the production of untruthful literature. Because they fail to do so, their behavior may be described by means of the metaphors that define the three subsequent stages of evil in the first verse of the psalm. Walking is associated with Ivan who moves to a new perception of reality; standing with the critics denouncing the Master; and sitting with Berlioz who ridicules evident things in order to render them meaningless. The analysis draws on Sergej Averincev’s commentary on Psalm 1. © 2017 The Association of Scandinavian Slavists and Baltologists.",evidence; evil; Mikhail Bulgakov; Psalm 1; Sergej Averincev; The Master and Margarita,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033384922

In this paper, we measure if the willingness to take risks is contagious and if this effect is different for immigrants and native-born individuals in the United States. We suggest that the willingness to take risks may be contagious, like emotions and generosity, i.e. an individual may be more willing to take risks if others make risky decisions. We measure if contagion has a stronger effect on willingness to take risks among immigrants than native populations using a variety of vignettes, specifically in the domains of career, financial investment, and health. Respondents were randomly assigned either to a control or experimental condition. In the experimental condition, we attempted to induce risk-taking by suggesting that other individuals made risky decisions in the lottery-choice tasks (a ‘risk shift condition’). Contrary to expectations, the risk shift condition had a positive effect on willingness to take risks among native-born, while a negative effect or no effect was found among immigrants (conservative shift). Native-born found the situations more beneficial in the risk shift condition than in the control condition, while immigrants found them less beneficial in the risk shift condition. The conservative shift was found among immigrants, as well as males and self-employed. Risk shift condition reduced the sense of power among power-motivated individuals (males and immigrants), which produced a less optimistic evaluation of risky situations. While taking into consideration that others make risky decisions, immigrants and males perceived situations as less beneficial for them. The results of the experiment have some implications for our understanding of the link between a sense of power and the willingness to take risks. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",immigrants; native-born; vignettes; willingness to take risks,Health risks; Risk management; Experimental conditions; Financial investments; immigrants; native-born; Risk taking; Risky decisions; vignettes; Risk assessment,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955139468

Giving insights in the ASEAN approach to Southeast Asia's international security challenges during the Cold War, the author then turns to ASEAN's policy towards the establishment of Asia-Pacific multilateral dialogue platforms on security issues through the prism of identifying the external and internal prerequisites for its success. The article highlights the most important global and regional challenges that ASEAN is currently encountering, and its readiness to respond appropriately. Finally, the article focuses upon the degree of ASEAN's relevance to its partners in terms of its potential contribution to the establishment of Greater Eurasia. In the author's view, necessary preconditions for ASEAN's successful policy are emerging there. The relevance of the undertaken analysis rests upon ASEAN's eagerness to raise its competitiveness against the downward trends in relations between global actors and the upcoming projection of their contradictions on the Asia-Pacific and Southeast Asia. Among the key reasons behind ASEAN's successes and failures during and after the Cold War, the author identifies readiness of ASEAN's partners to regard it as a unified entity, give it the privilege to moderate multilateral cooperation, and readiness of ASEAN itself to assume this mission. These three conditions predetermined ASEAN's international policy success, mainly manifested by the resolution of the Cambodian issue and establishment of multilateral dialogue platforms in the Asia-Pacific region. Realizing that only the multipolar world gives it chances for a decent future and encountering the rise of conflict in the current global political and economic affairs with its projection on Southeast Asia, the Association aims to develop cooperation in Greater Eurasia. This corresponds to the priorities of ASEAN's Eurasian partners over the establishment of a continental security, cooperation and co-development system, with ASEAN as an important actor.

Modern researchers of ASEAN in Russia work in a completely different environment and hardly recall those perceptions. Meanwhile, it seems that systematization of knowledge about ASEAN research as well as an understanding of the dynamics of its development could help to assess the effectiveness of the work done and adjust it to contemporary standards. The article analyzes the development of ASEAN research in the USSR and Russia. The first part of the article identifies research phases in the USSR and Russia and describes their key trends. Two phases have been defined in the Soviet period based on the intensity of the research (from the late 1960s to the mid- 1980s and from the mid-1980s to 1991). Contemporary Russian studies are divided into three phases in accordance with the changes that triggered the growth of interest in ASEAN in the academic circles of the Russian Federation (from 1991 to the mid-2000s, from the mid-2000s to 2014, and from 2014 up to the present). The second part specifies the institutional structure of ASEAN research in the USSR and Russia and outlines its key directions. Increasing attention to ASEAN is manifested in the growing number of institutions involved, publications, joint initiatives, and events. Nevertheless, most of them still involve organizations located in Moscow, while regional structures are less active. It seems that intensification of analytical and scientific work related to ASEAN in regional universities (especially in Siberia and the Far East) is likely to have a positive impact on the effectiveness of cooperation between Russia and ASEAN in future. Now, there are both opportunities and limitations for the further development of Russia-ASEAN relations.

Informally, a probability distribution is a plausible explanation for x if it looks likely that x was drawn at random with respect to that distribution. In this paper, we suggest three definitions of a plausible statistical hypothesis for Algorithmic Statistics with polynomial time bounds, which are called acceptability, plausibility and optimality. Roughly speaking, a probability distribution μ is called an acceptable explanation for x, if x possesses all properties decidable by short programs in a short time and shared by almost all objects (with respect to μ). Plausibility is a similar notion, however this time we require x to possess all properties T decidable even by long programs in a short time and shared by almost all objects. To compensate the increase in program length, we strengthen the notion of 'almost all' - the longer the program recognizing the property is, the more objects must share the property. Finally, a probability distribution μ is called an optimal explanation for x if μ(x) is large (close to 2-Cpoly(x)). Almost all our results hold under some plausible complexity theoretic assumptions. Our main result states that for acceptability and plausibility there are infinitely many non-stochastic objects, i.e. objects that do not have simple plausible (acceptable) explanations. Using the same techniques, we show that the distinguishing complexity of a string x can be super-logarithmically less than the conditional complexity of x with condition r for almost all r (for polynomial time bounded programs). Finally, we study relationships between the introduced notions. © Alexey Milovanov and Nikolay Vereshchagin.",Algorithmic Statistics; Distinguishing complexity; Elusive set; Kolmogorov complexity,Computability and decidability; Computational complexity; Polynomial approximation; Polynomials; Probability; Probability distributions; Statistics; Stochastic systems; Algorithmic statistics; Distinguishing complexity; Elusive set; Kolmogorov complexity; Non-stochastic; Polynomial-time; Statistical hypothesis; Stochasticity; Parallel processing systems,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028757374

As the allies worked through the postwar settlement with Germany, they considered another pressing question: How to treat the dead? The case of occupied Germany highlights different approaches to commemoration. Soviet officials commemorated the war dead as symbols of the collective sacrifice of the USSR in Eastern Europe, while the western allies desired to identify and rebury fallen soldiers to meet the expectations of their domestic audiences. Despite these differences, the politics of the sacred surrounding the dead necessitated that the allies engage one another. As the occupation regimes of France, the United Kingdom and the United States of America embarked on their mission to retrieve their dead from the Soviet zone, USSR officials reacted with skepticism and hostility. But rather than rejecting what they viewed as attempts at espionage, Soviet officers traded the western dead for their own sacred mission – the chance to return living Soviet repatriates from the western zones of occupation.

Four hypotheses on the relationship between per capita income and consumption, the composition of cutbacks, a levelling of expenditures among income groups, and the stability of the pattern of consumer response to economic shocks are proposed. The data demonstrate that consumption expenditures on food, non-food, and services decreased together with per capita income during the four economic shocks. Only a few examples of significant smoothing effects were found. All income groups recomposed their expenditures to maintain consumption of necessities. The high-income group reduced a higher proportion of expenditures on food and services, implying that economic shocks produce a temporary levelling effect on the living standards of different income groups. A relatively stable pattern of consumer responses to economic shocks was revealed, despite these shocks’ divergence; this pattern implies a temporary economization and simplification of expenditures with a fast return to pre-crisis spending once the crisis is over. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",consumption expenditures; consumption smoothing; economic shocks; income inequality; levelling effect; Russia,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020849291

Result 1 is the first impossibility result for this setting that uses ex-post efficiency; results 2 and 3 are more practical than similar results in the literature. In addition, for N=3, I give two characterizations of the celebrated random serial dictatorship mechanism: it is the unique strategy-proof, ex-post efficient mechanism that (4) provides agents that have the same ordinal preferences with assignments not dominated by each other (weak envy-freeness among equals), or (5) provides agents that have the same cardinal preferences with assignments of equal expected utility (symmetry).

Using a sample of large Russian companies in nonfinancial sectors between 2008 and 2015, this paper analyzes both equity and debt market timing to explore the impact of market timing on firms’ capital structure. To test the robustness of the results, we use several proxies for both timing types and include Russian-specific control variables of corporate governance and ownership. The results show that Russian companies time the debt market to attract extra capital if the value of the interest rate in the current period is lower than the rates in previous periods. The net debt issued decreases when interest rates are high, which indicates debt market timing. Consistent with previous studies, we find that Russian companies do not time the equity market. Added corporate governance factors suggest that younger boards of directors prefer debt financing to equity issuance, as well as more experienced ones.

The present study analyzes a large sample of Russian middle-school students (N = 1269; mean age = 14.9), comparing the patterns of drinking among middle-schoolers oriented towards vocational educational, and their peers who do not plan a vocational education path. Results suggest that the orientation towards vocational education is associated with disproportionately high alcohol involvement among Russian middle-school students, even before they enter vocational schools. We studied if such difference could be partially explained by how youth orient towards extracurricular activities: discretionary peer time in risky contexts, reading for pleasure, working for pay, and religious activities. Reading demonstrated the strongest (negative) association with alcohol use, while religious activity unexpectedly revealed a positive (though weak) association with drinking.

Using tropical geometry, we associate a subset of Δ to each of these subvarieties. We prove that a weighted sum of the volumes of these subsets estimates the volume of Δ from below. As a particular application of our method we consider a planar algebraic curve C which passes through generic points p1, … , pn with prescribed multiplicities m1, … , mn. Suppose that the minimal lattice width ω(Δ) of the Newton polygon Δ of the curve C is at least max (mi). Using tropical floor diagrams (a certain degeneration of p1, … , pn on a horizontal line) we prove that area(Δ)≥12∑i=1nmi2-S,whereS=12max(∑i=1nsi2|si≤mi,∑i=1nsi≤ω(Δ)).In the case m1= m2= ⋯ = m≤ ω(Δ) this estimate becomes area(Δ)≥12(n-ω(Δ)m)m2.

Exact solutions are found for the modified model of a stationary convective jet from a point source of buoyancy and momentum. The exact solutions are compared against analytical solutions of the integral models for a stationary jet that are based on the approximation of the vertical boundary layer. It is found that the modified integral models of convective jets retain the power-law dependences on the altitude for the vertical velocity and buoyancy obtained in classical models. For a buoyant jet in a neutrally stratified atmosphere, the inclusion of the pressure force increases the amplitude of buoyancy and decreases the amplitude of vertical velocity. The total amplitude change is about 10%. It is shown that in this model there is a dynamic invariant expressing the law of a uniform distribution of the potential and kinetic energy along the jet axis. For a spontaneous jet rising in an unstably stratified atmosphere, the inclusion of the pressure force retains the amplitude of buoyancy and increases the amplitude of vertical velocity by about 15%.

It was shown that certain wind forcing and river discharge conditions cause the formation of a specific structure of the Ob-Yenisei plume with significantly different properties of the Ob- and Yenisei-dominated water masses. Under these conditions, the Yenisei runoff generates a narrow coastal current propagating northward from the Yenisei Gulf along the Taymyr Peninsula, which is isolated by the Ob-dominated water mass from ambient sea water. As a result, the low-salinity Yenisei-dominated water mass occupies a relatively small area, while more saline Ob-dominated water mass spreads over a wide area between the Gulf of Ob and the Taymyr Peninsula. The formation of the “isolation” configuration of the Ob-Yenisei plume described above is presumed to be caused by the eastward Ekman transport and the resulting downwelling flow of the Ob-dominated waters under the low-saline and warm Yenisei-dominated waters along the Taymyr Peninsula. Based on satellite imagery, wind reanalysis, and river discharge data collected and derived for the period of 2005–2011, it was estimated that the “isolation” configuration is regularly formed during late summer and autumn when the Ob discharge to the Kara Sea exceeds the Yenisei discharge and the local atmospheric circulation is dominated by the northerly wind regime.

Customers become the new trailblazers. Thus, by adopting a customer led innovation perspective, this paper seeks to measure the effect on return on investment (ROI) of the use of SMNs as external drivers for supporting internal innovation search processes. On the basis of the extant literature on information system and social network analysis, the research describes and evaluates the multidimensional activities interwoven into the open innovation process, driven by integrating the five constructs of structural dimension, relational behaviour, cognitive dimension, knowledge transfer, and legitimization into our hypothesised conceptual model. Empirical research was conducted via the Classification Regression Tree (CART) on a sample of 2548 SMEs belonging to the fashion industry and based in Italy and in the United Kingdom. This study is of importance to academics and practitioners due to the increasing significance taken on by the adoption of social media networks in the fashion industry to improve innovation search. Recommendations are made to fashion managers and social media experts to support the planning and development of new products and services.

Statistically significant positive associations of 2D:4D (lower prenatal T) with higher levels of education were found, using difference in means analysis as well as generalized ordered logit regressions. These findings were also robust to using different subsamples. Weaker findings were seen for women.

IGWs were recorded using a group of four microbarographs (developed at the Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences) located at distances of 7 to 54 km between them. Regularities of variations in IGW parameters (spatial coherence, characteristic scales, propagation direction, horizontal propagation velocity, and amplitudes) before, during, and after the passage of an atmospheric front over the observation network, when the observation network finds itself inside the cyclone and outside the front, are studied. The results may be useful in studying the relationships between IGW effects in different physical fields at different atmospheric heights. It is shown that, within periods exceeding 30 min, IGWs are coherent between observation points horizontally spaced at distances of about 60 km (coherence coefficient is 0.6–0.9). It is also shown that there is coherence between wave fluctuations in atmospheric pressure and fluctuations in horizontal wind velocity within the height range 60–200 m. A joint analysis of both atmospheric pressure and horizontal wind fluctuations has revealed the presence of characteristic dominant periods, within which cross coherences between fluctuations in atmospheric pressure and wind velocity have local maxima. These periods are within approximate ranges of 20–29, 37–47, 62–72, and 100–110 min. The corresponding (to these dominant periods) phase propagation velocities of IGWs lie within an interval of 15–25 m/s, and the horizontal wavelengths vary from 52 to 99 km within periods of 35 to 110 min, respectively. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","a group of microbarographs; atmospheric fronts; atmospheric pressure fluctuations; coherence; dominant periods; internal gravity waves; phase velocities; spectra, vazimuths",,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028357465

This paper explores the possibility of using the central Minkowski partition in the ensemble of all Minkowski partitions for selecting an optimal value of the Minkowski exponent. The central Minkowski partition appears to be also a good consensus partition.

Motor symptoms first appear in patients 20–30 years after the onset of the neurodegeneration, when there has been a loss of an essential number of neurons and depletion of compensatory reserves of the brain, which explains the low efficiency of treatment. Therefore, the development of a technology for the diagnosing of Parkinson’s disease at the preclinical stage is of a high priority in neurology. In this study, we have developed at an experimental model a fundamentally novel for neurology approach for diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease at the preclinical stage. This methodology, widely used for the diagnosis of chronic diseases in the internal medicine, is based on the application of a challenge test that temporarily increases the latent failure of a specific functional system, thereby inducing the short-term appearance of clinical symptoms. The provocation test was developed by a systemic administration of α-methyl-p-tyrosine (αMpT), a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase to MPTP-treated mice at the presymptomatic stage of parkinsonism. For this, we first selected a minimum dose of αMpT, which caused a decrease of the dopamine level in the striatum of normal mice below the threshold at which motor dysfunctions appear. Then, we found the maximum dose of αMpT at which a loss of dopamine in the striatum of normal mice did not reach the threshold level, and motor behavior was not impaired. We showed that αMpT at this dose induced a decrease of the dopamine concentration in the striatum of MPTP-treated mice at the presymptomatic stage of parkinsonism below a threshold level that results in the impairment of motor behavior. Finally, we proved that αMpT exerts a temporal and reversible influence on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system of MPTP-treated mice with no long-term side effects on other catecholaminergic systems. Thus, the above experimental data strongly suggest that αMpT-based challenge test might be considered as the provocation test for Parkinson’s disease diagnosis at the preclinical stage in the future clinical trials. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; Mice; Motor behavior; Parkinson’s disease; Presymptomatic stage; Tyrosine hydroxylase","1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 1 methyl 4 phenylpyridine; dopamine; metirosine; 1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 1 methyl 4 phenylpyridine; catecholamine; metirosine; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; asymptomatic disease; controlled study; corpus striatum; dopaminergic system; early diagnosis; male; mouse; MPTP-induced parkinsonism; nigroneostriatal system; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; provocation test; animal; biological model; C57BL mouse; drug effects; metabolism; motor activity; neostriatum; nerve fiber; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; substantia nigra; 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; alpha-Methyltyrosine; Animals; Catecholamines; Early Diagnosis; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Models, Biological; Motor Activity; Neostriatum; Nerve Fibers; Parkinson Disease; Substantia Nigra; Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969822635

The crystal structure of MLS based on Cr-Gd-Cr-Fe layers with different Cr layer thicknesses was revealed. The use of RXRR at the Cr and Fe absorption edges significantly improves the optical contrast between correspondent layers. A significant Cr diffusion was detected in adjacent layers. After that diffusion, Fe and Gd layers transform to the solid solution of Cr in Fe and in Gd respectively, without changing their crystal structure. Such Cr behavior may affect both the exchange coupling between Fe and Gd magnetic moments and the structural parameters of Gd layers, thus influencing drastically the magnetic moment. © 2017",Metallic magnetic multilayers; Microanalysis; Microstructure; Resonant X-ray reflectivity; Scanning transmission electron microscopy,Crystal structure; Electron microscopy; Electron probe microanalysis; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Iron compounds; Magnetic moments; Magnetism; Microanalysis; Microstructure; Multilayers; Reflection; Scanning electron microscopy; Transmission electron microscopy; Absorption edges; Energy dispersive x ray microanalysis; Magnetic multilayer systems; Microstructural analysis; Optical contrast; Scanning transmission electron microscopy; Structural parameter; X ray reflectivity; Magnetic multilayers,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018455937

We consider a superconductor/ ferromagnetic insulator (S/FI) hybrid structure formed on the 3D topological insulator (TI) surface. In this case three ingredients ensure the possibility of the odd-frequency pairing: (1) the topological surface states, (2) the induced pair potential, and (3) the magnetic moment of a nearby ferromagnetic insulator. We take into account the strong anisotropy of the Dirac point in topological insulators when the chemical potential lies well above the Dirac cone and its constant energy contour has a snowflake shape. Within this model, we propose that the S/FI boundary should be properly aligned with respect to the snowflake constant energy contour to have an odd-frequency symmetry of the corresponding pairing component and to insure the Majorana bound state at the S/FI boundary. For arbitrary orientation of the boundary, the Majorana bound state is absent.

The flexibility of the stray charges gives rise to a polaronic effect, which leads to the onset of Arrhenius-type conductivity behavior at low temperatures, replacing conventional Mott variable-range hopping. The effective activation energy logarithmically depends on temperature due to fluctuations of the polaron barrier heights.

Research into various phenomena associated with alienation (frustration and burnout, extrinsic motivation, cynicism, etc.) is often limited by the ontological realm of the individual, whereas the concept of alienation refers to a whole range of processes characteristic of both individual and sociocultural levels. The study outlines the heuristic potential that the cultural-historical activity approach to meaning and meaning regulation has in the analysis of alienation phenomena. The author reviews findings of empirical studies of alienation in education, as well as the theoretical groundwork dealing with the triggers of alienation and ways to cope with it. The discussion reveals that as human knowledge expands and becomes more complex and multifaceted on an ongoing basis, this causes various manifestations of alienation to grow in their frequency and intensity across educational environments. However, what could potentially help overcome specific psychological instances of alienation is the individual’s conscious and more socially aligned self-identification that can be achieved through meaningful reflection on the contributory part they play in the broadest context of collective activity and societal progress as a whole. Although too abstract and heterogeneous for specific psychological studies to be based upon, the concept of alienation may be of great utility in interpreting psychological findings and integrating them into the interdisciplinary context, in order to more thoughtfully revisit and improve the existing institutional configurations and instructional practices. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040927385

The results of our research show that students had varying degrees of success applying the different stages of modeling depending on whether they were solving a familiar problem (involving near transfer) or one that had an unfamiliar context (involving far transfer): in cases of near transfer, students applied the template formally even though it did not align with the text of the new word problem, which complicated further interpretation. In cases of far transfer, students chose to solve the problem by using an ordinary method of selecting a solution by trial and error in preference to the use of modeling.

This study seeks to explore online users’ behavior and interactions within AIDS-denialist community to identify and estimate the number of those, who potentially are most susceptible to AIDS-denialist arguments—“the risk group” in terms of becoming AIDS denialists. Social network analysis was used for examining the most numerous AIDS-denialist community (over 15,000 members) in the most popular Russian SNS “VK.com.” In addition, content analysis was used for collecting data on attitudes toward AIDS-denialist arguments and participants’ self-disclosed HIV status. Two data sets were collected to analyze friendship ties and communication interactions among community members. We have identified the core of online community—cohesive and dedicated AIDS denialists, and the risk group: users who communicate with core members, and, thus, can be more susceptible to the AIDS-denialist propaganda and their health behaviors (e.g., refusing treatment).

The research was performed using the model-information complex detailed with respect to municipal areas and major peat deposits that was developed at the Energy Institute, National Research University Higher School of Economics. It is shown that the firing of lignin helium fuel (LHF) granules that are made from peat extracted by the excavating method according to the new, patented technology is considered most efficient. In nongasified areas, the total cost of heat power that is generated in new boiler houses on the basis of LHF granules is often lower than the total heat cost for the gasification of the area and construction of gas boiler houses. In some cases, the heat cost in gasified areas is lower when using a boiler house based on LHF granules than that provided by the conversion of a boiler house to gas fuel. It is also shown that the construction of peat-based heat sources with the overall power of up to 27600 GJ/h that generate a heat power of up to 167.5 million GJ/year will be economically efficient in the coming years, provided that the tariffs for energy sources remain the same. Taking into account the supportive measures that were accepted on a legislative basis in July 2016, sources with the total power of up to 70 GW may be effective for peat-based plants with combined heat-andpower generation. To stimulate the utilization of peat in decentralized power consumption areas and rural areas located in the vicinity of deposits of this fuel type, it is also suggested to make amendments in the normative legal base. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",competitiveness; decentralization; economic efficiency; electric power; heat power; peat; tariffs,Boilers; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Deposits; Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Fuels; Granulation; Heating; Houses; Patents and inventions; Peat; competitiveness; decentralization; Economic efficiency; Electric power; Heat power; tariffs; Rural areas; Boilers; Electric Power; Energy Consumption; Peat,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019733953

One of the key categories that appeared to set up analytical and regulatory frameworks was the ‘advanced technology’ category. Primarily associated with computer electronics and microelectronics, it soon had new meanings derived from a variety of professional discussions primarily in the social sciences. Later in a new term, ‘emerging technologies’, appeared to highlight the speed of change in a wide range of promising research areas. This paper focuses on the evolution of academic discussions concerning advanced and emerging technologies in social sciences literature for the period from 1955 until 2015. In order to identify whether studies in these areas constitute separate research fields, the paper studies the evolution of co-citation networks and the centrality characteristics of transitionary references. It was shown that social studies in emerging technologies demonstrate better consistency in background in literature. However, an analysis of transitionary references and their centrality characteristics can hardly confirm the existence of separate research fields in both cases.

The main idea consists of the simultaneous fitting of the credit default swap (CDS) and the defaultable bond quotes where the theoretical prices are calculated in the framework of the reduced-form modelling of credit risk under standard assumptions. We obtain not only the implied risk-free zero-coupon yield curve but also the implied issuer-specific hazard rate curves. Prior to fitting, we perform a selection of bond issues and issuers. Next, we check for data consistency via arbitrage-like reasoning. Typically, the initial data needs a consistency adjustment, namely ‘artificial’ widening of the observed bid-ask spreads for the selected financial instruments. We construct feasibility bands representing achievable precision of the fitting procedure depending on maturity. Then we apply this methodology to determine the term structure of the risk-free rates for the euro zone. This generic approach for the calculation of the risk-free reference rates in the euro zone can be helpful for the purposes of insurers and pension funds.

Therefore, information management in this light imposes special challenges on infrastructure. The present study discusses some methodological approaches and practical studies to set up a network of STI Foresight network in Russia, integrated into the national Foresight and planning system. We outline the principles for goal setting, network architecture, creating a network of experts, selecting key information products, and methodological support.

We reveal the four pitfalls basing on the analysis of the Russian experience through the last 150 years. First, the over-politicization and ideological biasness of sociological activities; second, the “personal sacrifice” of sociologist as a romanticized practice, potentially harmful for the discipline; third, the difficulties of the professional sociology institutionalization; fourth, the deprivation of the policy sociology development. Analyzing the history of Russian sociology in the context of the current international discussions, we give particular reference to the idea of the “Scientized Environment Supporting Actorhood” elaborated by John Meyer. We suggest the mode of communication between sociology and society, which, in our view, could be helpful for improving their interactions in various local, national and global contexts in the XXIst century. This mode escapes the political emphasis and ideological claims but rather concentrates on the more fundamental ethical issues. It also tries to overcome the limitations of the contemporary professional mainstream (instead of idealizing it). Finally, it presents itself to the publics in the understandable way, while remaining properly scientifically validated (however, avoiding the exaggerated accent on the statistical procedures and fitishization of the natural science’ principles (“numerology” and “quantofrenia”)). The public activities of the prominent sociologist Pitirim Sorokin in the American period of his career are a good example of this approach to the interactions with society. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",John Meyer; Methodology; Pitirim Sorokin; Professional sociology; Public sociology; Russian sociology; Scientized environment supporting actorhood; Sociology and society,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955298095

Transboundary waters in Central Asia play important role in the economic cooperation among riparian states, including those who are members of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). At the current stage of transboundary waters management in Central Asia, the obsolete legal status is evident. The international water law sources developed under the United Nations’ auspices have no binding application due to luck of formal membership of the EAEU states in these treaties. Also the regional set of regulations, especially for the Aral Sea Basin, needs further enhancement and more efficient implementation. The bilateral interstate regulatory framework of the managemennt of waters shared by EAEU states in Central Asia requires development of additional rules to enable better accommodation of challenges existing in terms of the current interstate cooperation. Having said that can one further assume that EAEU could serve as a new legal framework for more effective cooperation on transboundary watercourses in Central Asia? The answer might be yes, but… the current stage of the legal framework for cooperation on transboundary waters within the EAEU requires sufficient enhancements in terms of developing its legal and institutional framework. The first condition for EAEU to serve as framework for cooperation on transboundary waters of Central Asia is to strengthen the regulatory framework for the cooperation of EAEU member states regarding environmental issues in general and transboundary water relations in particular, able to accommodate two main goals: environmental protection on the one hand and economic development on the other hand.

The empirical evidence reveals common and distinct effects of commuting on fertility of those women who involved in daily mobility and not.

Shipbuilding has evolved into a high tech industry over the last few decades that is strongly driven by customer needs and wishes. Consequently economic development of the industry is now far more complex than previously. International competition in the shipbuilding industry is very strong in all segments of the industry. The article assesses the future development of the shipbuilding industry globally and evaluates the position and opportunities for Russian shipbuilding. International experience of estimating industries' future development shows that a necessary condition of success is building a vision of the industry's long-term future in the context of social and economic development. One way to create such a long-term vision is through developing scenarios based on factors including wild card events, global challenges, trends, threats, drivers, barriers, and limitations. One of the most effective approaches to enhance competitiveness of the industry is Technology Foresight. The paper presents results of Foresight for civil shipbuilding in Russia on the basis of benchmarking, expert procedures and scenario analysis. It demonstrates how Technology Foresight was adjusted to the special conditions of Russia as an emerging country and how the special features of strategic industries which are in the national interest of countries can be included in Technology Foresight studies.

Using bank-level quarterly data over the period 2005–2013, we perform stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) and compute cost efficiency scores at the bank and bank group levels. We deduct from gross costs the negative revaluations of foreign currency items generated by official exchange rate dynamics rather than by managerial decisions. The results indicate that the core state banks, as distinct from other state-controlled banks, were nearly as efficient as private domestic banks during and after the crisis of 2008–2009. Foreign banks appear to be the least efficient market participants in terms of costs, which might reflect their lower (and decreasing over time) penetration of the Russian banking system. We further document that the group ranking by cost efficiency is not permanent over time and depends on the observed differences in bank capitalization and asset structure. We find that foreign banks gain cost efficiency when they lend more to the economy. Core state banks, conversely, lead in terms of cost efficiency when they lend less to the economy, which can result from political interference in their lending decisions in favor of unprofitable projects Private domestic banks that maintain a lower capitalization significantly outperform foreign banks and do not differ from the core state banks in this respect. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Asset structure; Bank ownership; Capitalization; Cost efficiency; Russia; State-controlled banks; Stochastic frontier analysis,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018791770

First, foresight activities would benefit from being more informed by the convergence literature and global convergence experience over the past several decades, and should therefore incorporate organically the concepts of absorptive capacity and technology gap into foresight exercises. Second, certain preconditions – in particular the existence of a functional national innovation system – enhance the likelihood that foresight exercises will be successful. Third, in order to achieve wide buy-in and promote the sustainability of initiatives generated by the foresight activity, developing countries are advised to consult widely in the foresight process.

Here, we have investigated a superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) operated as a photon counting mixer at telecommunication wavelength around 1.5 μm. This regime of operation combines excellent sensitivity of a photon counting detector with excellent spectral resolution given by the heterodyne technique. Advantageously, we have found that low local oscillator (LO) power of the order of hundreds of femtowatts to a few picowatts is sufficient for clear observation of the incident test signal with the sensitivity approaching the quantum limit. With further optimization, the required LO power could be significantly reduced, which is promising for many practical applications, such as the development of receiver matrices or recording ultralow signals at a level of less-than-one-photon per second. In addition to a traditional NbN-based SNSPD operated with normal incidence coupling, we also use detectors with a travelling wave geometry, where a NbN nanowire is placed on the top of a Si 3 N 4 nanophotonic waveguide.

However, a second possibility is simply that cultural norms deter Russians from displaying happiness that they actually feel. To test this second possibility, three studies compared the emotional inhibition tendencies in U.S. and Russian student samples. Although Russians and Americans were no different on subjective well-being (SWB), a consistent three-way interaction was found such that Russians (compared with Americans) reported greater inhibition of the expression of happiness (vs. unhappiness), but mainly to strangers (vs. friends/family). Russians also viewed their peers and countrymen as behaving similarly. Furthermore, a consistent interaction was found such that the degree of happiness inhibition with strangers was negatively correlated with SWB in the U.S. samples but was unrelated to SWB in the Russian samples. Given the equivalent levels of SWB observed in these data, we suggest that Russians may not be less happy than Americans, as this would illogically entail that they exaggerate their SWB reports while also claiming to inhibit their expression of happiness.

Achieving prominence in Japan and Western Europe, it attracted the attention of researchers and policy analysts in many parts of the world in subsequent decades. TF is often seen as a set of tools for informing decisions about STI priorities within established innovation systems. These priorities have necessarily changed as scientific knowledge, technological opportunities, and social demands have evolved. But so too have the ways in which innovation processes operate, and understandings of the roles that STI policies can play. Accordingly TF has also been applied to inform efforts to restructure innovation systems - and, indeed, it was often seen as also providing tools to assist in such efforts. The need for such restructuring has been particularly acute in countries undergoing massive transitions. These include transitions from centrally planned to market economies, from non-industrial to newly industrialized countries, and from being imitation-oriented to becoming innovation pioneers. Correspondingly, considerable effort has been put into TF in many such countries. But much of this TF effort has been largely invisible, or at best poorly documented. TF may itself require redesign, taking different forms in various contexts, and as experience with the tools has accumulated.

Here, we selected a material, 3.6-nm-thick MoN x film, which features diffusivity close to those of NbN traditionally used for SSPD fabrication, but with electron-phonon interaction time an order of magnitude larger. In MoN x detectors, we study the dependence of detection efficiency on bias current, photon energy, and strip width, and compare it with NbN SSPD. We observe nonlinear current-energy dependence in MoN x SSPD and more pronounced plateaus in dependences of detection efficiency on bias current, which we attribute to longer electron-phonon interaction time. © 2017 IEEE.",nanowire single-photon detectors; superconducting photoncounting devices; Thin film devices,Avalanche photodiodes; Electron-phonon interactions; Energy efficiency; Particle beams; Photons; Superconducting devices; Superconducting films; Thin film devices; Thin films; Detection efficiency; Electron phonon; Nonlinear current; Photon absorptions; Photon counting; Single-photon detectors; Superconducting single-photon detectors; Thin superconducting films; Niobium compounds,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017635633

We combined behavioral and electrophysiological measures and structural-connectivity estimates to characterize neuroplasticity underlying successful compensation of language abilities after left-hemispheric stroke. We recorded the electroencephalogram from patients with stroke lesions to the left temporal lobe and from matched controls during context-driven word retrieval. Participants heard lead-in sentences that either constrained the final word (“He locked the door with the”) or not (“She walked in here with the”). The last word was shown as a picture to be named. Individual-participant analyses were conducted, focusing on oscillatory power as a subsecond indicator of a brain region's functional neurophysiological computations. All participants named pictures faster following constrained than unconstrained sentences, except for two patients, who had extensive damage to the left temporal lobe. Left-lateralized alpha–beta oscillatory power decreased in controls pre-picture presentation for constrained relative to unconstrained contexts. In patients, the alpha–beta power decreases were observed with the same time course as in controls but were lateralized to the intact right hemisphere. The right lateralization depended on the probability of white-matter connections between the bilateral temporal lobes. The two patients who performed poorly behaviorally showed no alpha–beta power decreases. Our findings suggest that incorporating direct measures of neural activity into investigations of neuroplasticity can provide important neural markers to help predict language recovery, assess the progress of neurorehabilitation, and delineate targets for therapeutic neuromodulation.

timely monitoring of disease burden in all age groups, including children and adolescents, is essential for improving population health. OBJECTIVE: To quantify and describe levels and trends of mortality and nonfatal health outcomes among children and adolescents from 1990 to 2015 to provide a framework for policy discussion. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Cause-specific mortality and nonfatal health outcomes were analyzed for 195 countries and territories by age group, sex, and year from 1990 to 2015 using standardized approaches for data processing and statistical modeling, with subsequent analysis of the findings to describe levels and trends across geography and time among children and adolescents 19 years or younger. A composite indicator of income, education, and fertility was developed (Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) for each geographic unit and year, which evaluates the historical association between SDI and health loss. FINDINGS: Global child and adolescent mortality decreased from 14.18 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 14.09 million to 14.28 million) deaths in 1990 to 7.26 million (95% UI, 7.14 million to 7.39 million) deaths in 2015, but progress has been unevenly distributed. Countries with a lower SDI had a larger proportion of mortality burden (75%) in 2015 than was the case in 1990 (61%). Most deaths in 2015 occurred in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Global trends were driven by reductions in mortality owing to infectious, nutritional, and neonatal disorders, which in the aggregate led to a relative increase in the importance of noncommunicable diseases and injuries in explaining global disease burden. The absolute burden of disability in children and adolescents increased 4.3%(95%UI, 3.1%-5.6%) from 1990 to 2015, with much of the increase owing to population growth and improved survival for children and adolescents to older ages. Other than infectious conditions, many top causes of disability are associated with long-term sequelae of conditions present at birth (eg, neonatal disorders, congenital birth defects, and hemoglobinopathies) and complications of a variety of infections and nutritional deficiencies. Anemia, developmental intellectual disability, hearing loss, epilepsy, and vision loss are important contributors to childhood disability that can arise from multiple causes. Maternal and reproductive health remains a key cause of disease burden in adolescent females, especially in lower-SDI countries. In low-SDI countries, mortality is the primary driver of health loss for children and adolescents, whereas disability predominates in higher-SDI locations; the specific pattern of epidemiological transition varies across diseases and injuries. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Consistent international attention and investment have led to sustained improvements in causes of health loss among children and adolescents in many countries, although progress has been uneven. The persistence of infectious diseases in some countries, coupled with ongoing epidemiologic transition to injuries and noncommunicable diseases, require all countries to carefully evaluate and implement appropriate strategies to maximize the health of their children and adolescents and for the international community to carefully consider which elements of child and adolescent health should be monitored. © 2017 American Medical Association.

We will analyze four different culture groups: Czechs and Russians (Muscovites) both representing post-modernized cultures and Dagestans and Chechens both representing traditional cultures. The data will be analyzed using univariate comparisons and fixed effects regressions. Our results indicate that cultural background does not play such a crucial role for social network composition and social capital access through the family or friends. In both cases, Dagestans, Chechens and Czechs access significantly less social capital than do the Russians (Muscovites), however only if Russians (Muscovites) are in frequent contact with their families or have large friendship networks. In other words, network embeddedness seems to play a more important role than cultural background for social capital access. © 2017, University of Surrey.

Inverse proximity suppresses the superconducting gap in superconducting leads in the vicinity of turnstile junctions, thus, trapping hot QPs in this region. An external magnetic field creates additional QP traps in the leads in the form of vortices or regions with a reduced superconducting gap resulting in the release of QPs away from the junctions. We present clear experimental evidence of the interplay of the inverse proximity effect and magnetic field revealing itself in the superconducting gap enhancement and significant improvement of the turnstile characteristics. The observed interplay and its theoretical explanation in the context of QP overheating are important for various superconducting and hybrid nanoelectronic devices, which find applications in quantum computation, photon detection, and quantum metrology. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020005456

In order to use source connectivity analysis as a reliable research tool, there is a need for stability across a wider range of standard estimation routines. Using resting state EEG recordings of N=65 participants acquired within two studies, we present the first comprehensive assessment of the consistency of EEG source localization and functional/effective connectivity metrics across two anatomical templates (ICBM152 and Colin27), three electrical models (BEM, FEM and spherical harmonics expansions), three inverse methods (WMNE, eLORETA and LCMV), and three software implementations (Brainstorm, Fieldtrip and our own toolbox). Source localizations were found to be more stable across reconstruction pipelines than subsequent estimations of functional connectivity, while effective connectivity estimates where the least consistent. All results were relatively unaffected by the choice of the electrical head model, while the choice of the inverse method and source imaging package induced a considerable variability. In particular, a relatively strong difference was found between LCMV beamformer solutions on one hand and eLORETA/WMNE distributed inverse solutions on the other hand. We also observed a gradual decrease of consistency when results are compared between studies, within individual participants, and between individual participants. In order to provide reliable findings in the face of the observed variability, additional simulations involving interacting brain sources are required. Meanwhile, we encourage verification of the obtained results using more than one source imaging procedure. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Consistency; Electroencephalography (EEG); Forward/inverse modeling; Functional/effective connectivity; Reproducibility; Source localization,"adult; Article; brain function; brain region; connectome; electroencephalography; female; human; human experiment; image analysis; image processing; information processing; male; neuroimaging; normal human; resting state network; signal noise ratio; validation study; alpha rhythm; biological model; brain cortex; brain mapping; electroencephalography; nerve tract; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; signal processing; Alpha Rhythm; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Electroencephalography; Humans; Models, Neurological; Neural Pathways; Reproducibility of Results; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Signal-To-Noise Ratio",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016014548

We experimentally demonstrate feasibility and scalability of our rewritings compared to previously proposed NDL-rewritings. On the negative side, we prove that answering OMQs with tree-shaped CQs is not fixed-parameter tractable if the ontology depth or the number of leaves in the CQs is regarded as the parameter, and that answering OMQs with a fixed ontology (of infinite depth) is NP-complete for tree-shaped CQs and LOGCFL-complete for bounded-leaf CQs. © 2017 ACM.",Combined complexity; Ontology-based data access; Ontology-mediated query; Parameterised complexity; Query rewriting,Database systems; Query processing; Trees (mathematics); Bounded treewidth; Combined complexity; Conjunctive queries (cqs); Negative sides; Non-recursive datalog; Ontology-based data access; Parameterised complexity; Query rewritings; Ontology,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021207408

Existing data allow us to say that two different tendencies exist in the Duma. One of them is connected with the change in the composition of the deputy corps, caused by the addition of a majority component, which has influenced the principles of selecting candidates, and by a number of other causes—from the assumption of a low turn-out to the emergence of new bans and restrictions in legislation. Another involves the change in style of work of the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly. Besides efforts directly toward reducing scandalous behavior and overcoming the reputation of a “maniacal printer,” this concerns attempts by the leadership of the Duma in general and individual parliamentary groups to regulate and centralize the lawmaking process as much as possible. If the first tendency involves increasing political independence of deputies (as a consequence of the increase of the importance of their personal qualities at elections), the second means an even greater reduction of their influence on decisions taken by the Duma.

The first period has been perceived as one of inception and learning, while the second as an era of maturity and genuine establishment of early Russian cinema. World War I, which abruptly restricted the import of foreign films into Russia, has usually been treated as a positive factor in the history of Russian cinema and the most important reason for its blossoming in 1914–18. Yet it may also be argued that the war created turmoil in the Russian film industry. The new, forced production rates negatively impacted on the quality of films and did not help the natural development of a national cinema tradition.

The portrayal of African characters in these films is antagonistically positioned in relation to the dominant, ‘whitewashed’ Greek national narrative which relies on the nineteenth century idea that Greece is the progenitor of European civilization. Often masquerading itself as ‘just a joke’, the discourse of these films narrates the African Other as lacking in terms of culture, intelligence and beauty–the three central categories upon which the idea of the ‘white supremacy’, according to Cornell West, is historically constructed in modernity. Tightly woven with this idea (largely introduced in Greece by the leading European powers), these films enunciate explicitly colonial viewpoints in a country that was neither a colonial power nor at the geopolitical center of the European project. The article argues that the racialized representations of these films are an effect of appropriating the Eurocentric idea of historicism, where the ‘progress’ and ‘backwardness’ of groups and nations are measured according to how effectively they perform the values of modernity. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Greek film; othering; race; Representation; visual culture,colonialism; cultural history; film industry; geopolitics; modernity; nineteenth century; race; Greece,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979708907

The international criminal tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia were initially supported but later the Yugoslavian tribunal was much criticized at the political level, and this opposition was partly transferred to the ICC. Russia's minimalistic approach to international criminal law had an influence on national criminal legislation, and its status with regard to international crimes might be characterized as deplorable. In contrast, at the theoretical level there is now a rising interest in international criminal law and a cognizance of the need for reforms. The efforts at reform in national legislation reveal general and particular problems, which should be resolved in the course of implementing the legislation. These problems are outlined and the methods used to overcome them are presented in this article.

The LqHV mathematical framework allows us to derive for all d and N a new upper bound (2d-1)N-1 on the maximal violation by an N-qudit state of all general Bell inequalities, also, new upper bounds on the maximal violation by an N-qudit state of general Bell inequalities for S settings per site.

This paper proposes an intangibles-based tool for picking companies with value growth potential. Design/methodology/approach We suggest a model to select companies that effectively use unique intangibles (in contrast to the generic intangibles). To test whether these results can be explained by skill we implement a bootstrap procedure. Companies that are able to use unique intangibles efficiently are combined in a portfolio. Findings Only 22% of companies have the skills to use unique intangibles, but all of them are characterized by the efficiency of their use. The created portfolio demonstrates a higher cumulative return, Sharpe ratio and lower drawdown than S&P500. We also find the increasing importance of intangibles for investors during the crisis. Research limitations/implications Both the created portfolio and the benchmark (S&P 500 index) are analyzed without transaction costs. Also the benchmark construction is based on equal-weighted sum of company M/B ratios.

The BPMN standard [1] offers high-level modeling constructs, such as subprocesses, events, data and message flows, lanes, and is widely used to model processes in various domains. Recently several BPMN-based process mining techniques [2, 3, 4] were introduced. These techniques allow representing processes, discovered from the event logs of process-aware information systems, in a convenient way, using the BPMN standard. To test these mining approaches an appropriate tool for the generation of event logs from BPMN models is needed. In this work we suggest such a tool. We propose a formal token-based executable BPMN semantics, which takes into account BPMN 2.0 with its expressive constructs. The developed tool is based on these semantics and allows simulation of hierarchical process models (including models with cancellations), models with data flows and pools, and models interacting through message flows. To manage the control flow, script-based gateways and choice preferences are implemented as well. The proposed simulation technique was implemented on top of existing plug-ins for ProM (Process Mining Framework) [5], and was verified on models created by practitioners from various domains. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",BPMN (Business process model and notation); Business process simulation; Event log generation; Process mining,Administrative data processing; Data mining; Enterprise resource management; Semantics; Business process management; Business process model; Business process model and notation (BPMN); Business process simulation; Event log generation; Hierarchical process; Process mining; Process-aware information systems; Data flow analysis,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011347863

Those closures can be either standalone or combined with other techniques for the treatment of artificial outer boundaries. A standalone lacunae-based closure can be thought of as a special artificial boundary condition (ABC) that is provably free from any error associated with the domain truncation. If combined with a different type of ABC or a perfectly matched layer (PML), a lacunae-based approach can help remove any long-time deterioration (e.g., instability) that arises at the outer boundary regardless of why it occurs in the first place. A specific difficulty associated with Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism is that in general their solutions do not have classical lacunae and rather have quasi-lacunae. Unlike in the classical case, the field inside the quasi-lacunae is not zero; instead, there is an electrostatic solution driven by the electric charges that accumulate over time. In our previous work [23], we have shown that quasi-lacunae can also be used for building the far-field closures. However, for achieving a provably non-deteriorating performance over arbitrarily long time intervals, the accumulated charges need to be known ahead of time. The main contribution of the current paper is that we remove this limitation and modify the algorithm in such a way that one can rather avoid the accumulation of charge all together. Accordingly, the field inside the quasi-lacunae becomes equal to zero, which facilitates obtaining the temporally uniform error estimates as in the case of classical lacunae. The performance of the modified algorithm is corroborated by a series of numerical simulations. The range of problems that the new method can address includes important combined formulations, for which the interior subproblem may be non-Huygens', and only the exterior subproblem, i.e., the far field, is Huygens'. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Accumulation of charge; Aft fronts of the waves; Artificial boundary conditions (ABCs); Artificial outer boundaries; Grid truncation; Guaranteed accuracy; Lacunae of the solutions; Long time deterioration; Loss of accuracy, loss of stability, error build-up; Maxwell's equations; Non-reflecting boundaries; Perfectly matched layer (PML); Quasi-lacunae; Temporally uniform error bounds; The Huygens’ principle; Unbounded regions; Unsteady electromagnetic waves",,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012024596

It is shown that the waves can be excited for the photoelectron parameters corresponding to the quantum yield of the lunar regolith reported by Willis et al. [Photon and Particle Interactions with Surfaces in Space, Ed. by R. J. L. Grard (Reidel, Dordrecht, 1973), p. 389]. Ion-acoustic waves are excited in the regions of the transient magnetic and/or boundary magnetospheric layers due to the onset of linear hydrodynamic instability, whereas dust-acoustic waves are generated due to the onset of linear kinetic instability in the entire region of magnetotail interaction with dusty plasma near the Moon. In both cases, instability is caused by the relative motion of the magnetospheric ions and charged dust grains. The dynamics of the development of ion-acoustic and dust-acoustic turbulence is investigated. Ion-acoustic turbulence is described in terms of strong turbulence theory, while dust-acoustic turbulence is described in terms of weak turbulence theory. The energy density of oscillations, the effective collision frequencies, and the electric fields arising in the system are determined for both ion-acoustic and dust-acoustic turbulences. It is shown that the development of ion-acoustic turbulence in the dusty plasma system near the Moon can lead to the generation of electric fields that are somewhat weaker than those arising near the lunar surface due to the charging of the Moon’s surface under the action of solar radiation, but still sufficiently strong to affect the electric field pattern above the Moon. The obtained effective collision frequencies should be taken into consideration when deriving hydrodynamic equations for dusty plasma ions with allowance for turbulent plasma heating. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020040809

It is difficult to discriminate the cortical zones directly associated with emotional arousal from the activity of structures responsible for assessing emotional stimuli in the inducement/reward system. The aim of the present work was to identify differences in cerebral activity using functional MRI scans (fMRI) in men during assessment of the intensity of pleasant images, including erotic images, or unpleasant and neutral images. Comparison of tasks involving the assessment of pleasant images of the erotic type with tasks containing neutral or unpleasant stimuli revealed significantly more marked activation in the posterior cingulate cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and the globus pallidus on the right side. Comparison of tasks with pleasant and neural stimuli revealed an increase in the activity of the right anterior central gyrus. Thus, the process of assessment of the intensity of emotional images of erotic type was related to activation of brain areas belonging not only to the neural representation of the emotions, but also to the cognitive system controlling emotional arousal and the motivational domain, which needs to be considered when using erotic images as powerful positive emotional stimuli. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",emotions; fMRI; motivation; reward; sexual arousal,adult; functional magnetic resonance imaging; globus pallidus; human; human experiment; male; middle aged; motivation; perception; posterior cingulate; prefrontal cortex; reward; sexual arousal; stimulus,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018779270

The innovation literature has differentiated these collaborations into informal inbound OI entry modes and formal inbound OI modes, offering an advocative and conceptual view. However, empirical studies on these collaborations are still limited. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the above-mentioned theoretical framework, the empirical research was performed in two stages. First, data were collected via a closed-ended questionnaire distributed to all the participants from the sample by e-mail. Second, to assess the hypotheses, structural equation modelling (SEM) via IBM® SPSS® Amos 20 was applied. Findings: The empirical research was conducted on 175 small to medium enterprises in the United Kingdom, suggesting that the knowledge-driven approach is the strongest determinant, leading to a preference for informal inbound OI modes. The findings were obtained using SEM and are discussed in line with the theoretical framework. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the chosen context and sector of the empirical analysis, the research results may lack generalisability. Hence, new studies are proposed.

They depend on complex parameters λ, μ, and n. The restriction of the family to real parameters satisfying the inequality λ + μ2 &gt; 0 is a linearization of the family of nonlinear equations on the two-torus that model the Josephson effect in superconductivity. We show that for all b, n ∈ ℂ satisfying a certain “non-resonance condition” and for all parameter values λ, μ ∈ ℂ, μ ≠ 0, there exists an entire function f±: ℂ → ℂ (unique up to a constant factor) such that z−bL(zbf±(z±1)) = d0± + d1±z for some d0±, d1± ∈ ℂ. The constants dj,± are expressed as functions of the parameters. This result has several applications. First of all, it gives the description of those values λ, μ, n, and b for which the monodromy operator of the corresponding Heun equation has eigenvalue e2πib. It also gives the description of those values λ, μ, and n for which the monodromy is parabolic, i.e., has a multiple eigenvalue. We consider the rotation number ρ of the dynamical system on the two-torus as a function of parameters restricted to a surface λ + μ2 = const. The phase-lock areas are its level sets with nonempty interior. For general families of dynamical systems, the problem of describing the boundaries of the phase-lock areas is known to be very complicated. In the present paper we include the results in this direction that were obtained by methods of complex variables. In our case the phase-lock areas exist only for integer rotation numbers (quantization effect), and their complement is an open set. On their complement the rotation number function is an analytic submersion that induces its fibration by analytic curves. The above-mentioned result on parabolic monodromy implies the explicit description of the union of boundaries of the phase-lock areas as solutions of an explicit transcendental functional equation. For every θ ∉ ℤ we get a description of the set {ρ ≡ ±θ (mod 2ℤ)}. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029164607

However, learning to meditate is not straightforward as there are no easily discernible outward signs of performance and thus no direct feedback is possible. As meditation has been found to correlate with posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activity, we tested whether source-space EEG neurofeedback from the PCC followed the subjective experience of effortless awareness (a major component of meditation), and whether participants could volitionally control the signal. Methods Sixteen novice meditators and sixteen experienced meditators participated in the study. Novice meditators were briefly trained to perform a basic meditation practice to induce the subjective experience of effortless awareness in a progressively more challenging neurofeedback test-battery. Experienced meditators performed a self-selected meditation practice to induce this state in the same test-battery. Neurofeedback was provided based on gamma-band (40–57 Hz) PCC activity extracted using a beamformer algorithm. Associations between PCC activity and the subjective experience of effortless awareness were assessed by verbal probes. Results Both groups reported that decreased PCC activity corresponded with effortless awareness (P < 0.0025 for each group), with high median confidence ratings (novices: 8 on a 0–10 Likert scale; experienced: 9). Both groups showed high moment-to-moment median correspondence ratings between PCC activity and subjective experience of effortless awareness (novices: 8, experienced: 9). Both groups were able to volitionally control the PCC signal in the direction associated with effortless awareness by practicing effortless awareness meditation (novices: median % of time = 77.97, P = 0.001; experienced: 89.83, P < 0.0005). Conclusions These findings support the feasibility of using EEG neurofeedback to link an objective measure of brain activity with the subjective experience of effortless awareness, and suggest potential utility of this paradigm as a tool for meditation training. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",EEG; Meditation; Mindfulness; Neurofeedback; PCC; Posterior cingulate cortex,adult; Article; awareness; correlation analysis; effortless awareness; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography phase synchronization; female; human; low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography; male; meditation; mental task; middle aged; mindfulness; neurofeedback; occipital cortex; posterior cingulate; supplementary motor area; task performance; awareness; cingulate gyrus; cognition; electroencephalography; gamma rhythm; meditation; physiology; procedures; Awareness; Electroencephalography; Female; Gamma Rhythm; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Male; Meditation; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Neurofeedback; Volition,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959544116

It integrates different theoretical aspects and practical approaches, such as conceptual ID models, technology-based ID, and research-based ID. In doing so, this book takes a multi-perspective view on the questions that are central for professional ID: How to analyze the relevant characteristics of the learner and the environment? How to create precise goals and adequate instruments of assessment? How to design classroom and technology-supported learning environments? How to ensure effective teaching and learning by employing formative and summative evaluation? Furthermore, this book presents empirical findings on the processes that enable effective instructional designing.

We offer a path-dependent theory of political change and use insights from cognitive institutionalism to show how ad hoc policy reform practices become accepted as a trusted way of interaction by political actors and how they “learn” their way into autocracy. This intuition is substantiated with a case-study of the labour reform in Putin’s Russia. The early 2000s marked a surge in uncertainty in Russian politics caused by the succession crisis and the profound political turnover it triggered. This uncertainty could have resolved in a number of ways, each leading to a different political development. We trace the actual way out of this uncertainty and show that the major factor to condition further regime trajectory was the way social reforms were conducted. The course of these reforms determined the ruling coalition and the institutions that ensure credible commitment within its ranks (the dominant party), and contributed to crowding out the political market and opposition decay. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",authoritarianism; collective learning; labour reform; Path dependence; Russia; social reforms; transition,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984693534

As a result of our investigation of STEM subjects for preschoolers and the gender considerations that should be incorporated into successful teaching strategies, we have concluded that together with the preparation and institutionalization of such training programs it is necessary to teach the designers of educational programs as well as educators about the specific features that characterize how boys and girls learn. A curriculum that takes gender differences into account is one that does not allow the development of a gender dichotomy in education.

We use the case of the Communist legacies in Russia to show that compliant activism can, indeed, become highly persistent and outlive the regime, where it emerged. Using cross-regional variation in the levels of compliant activism in the contemporary Russia, we demonstrate that it is strongly affected by the variation in the membership share of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the 1970s.

Primary attention is given to the analysis of entropy behavior: the discretization is specially constructed so that the total entropy does not decrease. This is achieved via a substantial revision of the standard discretization and applying numerous original features.

The provided model reduces the risk of duplicate management functions, minimizes bureaucracy and costs intensity of processes, motivates management to obtain results and covers all levels of company management. The ability to evaluate the management processes efficiency in relation to the main objectives of the company as well as the opportunity to control the management process at each level are distinctive features of the model. Design/methodology/approach: The model is based on the integration of the functions of the two most common models in practice: 3 LoD and functional model of risk management. Evaluating the effectiveness of management functions is achieved by the introduction of the key management performance indicators, and the accuracy of the base for the calculation of KPIs - by Behnisch M-score. Findings: The introduction of risk management and internal control procedures are in themselves a sign of the maturity of the management company and an indicator of the potential investment appeal. Compliance with all of the recommendations in relation to internal control and risk management is not appropriate and is destroying the value of small and medium-sized businesses. Most of the processes of risk management and internal control systems are duplicative, but targeted at different results depending on the management objective. Application of KPIs is expedient at evaluating the effectiveness of the organizational model of risk management and internal control, and choice of KPIs and their distribution depends on the risk owners in the model. Application of Behnisch M-score increases business transparency and stakeholder confidence in the results. Case study, presented in the article, fully reflects the purpose of research and demonstrates that management results are quite different among similar in size, type and market conditions companies: The poor organization of internal control and attempts to manipulate reporting, provokes negative trend - the company's value starts falling, despite the fact that the purpose of manipulation was to increase the investment attractiveness. Originality/value: None of the presented in prior research studies was not aimed on integration of management and control functions within a single model, and, moreover, was not aimed to use the accounting approach for evaluating the effectiveness of management functions. Nevertheless, the possibility of manipulating the statements are quite broad and do not always include illegal methods. In this regard it is necessary to consider the relevance of the data in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the company's management model.",Efficiency; Enterprise risk management; Internal controls; Key performance indicators; Organizational model,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018892709

The study demonstrates that the recipients of the Almshouse relief did not belong to the lowest tiers of Moscow population but originated from its middle stratum. They were clerks and ranked officials, the military of middle ranks, and priests, or their families. Considerable number of them had additional sources of income before they obtained allowances from the Almshouse, only for a few of them the relief was crucial for survival. This paradox can be explained by examining the reports on the recipients written by an administrator of the Almshouse. The document reveals that the Almshouse supported those Moscow dwellers who were involved in the network of patronage or were connected by the relations of military or civil service with the administration of the Almshouse and with Moscow aristocracy. The support from the patrons served a better guarantee for the Almshouse’s administration than the evidences of the neighbours or relatives. On the basis of the unearthed archival documents, the study brings out that the Almshouse was an institution deeply rooted in the Moscow patronage and protective network which connected people of middle stratum and the aristocracy. Selecting recipients of relief, the administration of the Almshouse was guided by the logic of privilege and assertion of status opposed to economic definitions of poverty. © 2017 The Russian Review.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015057366

Russia's new personal data localization regulations: A step forward or a self-imposed sanction? // [2016] 32 Computer Law &amp; Security Review 128–145. In this paper, I will demonstrate how open source software may be used for achieving similar purposes. However, the interplay between local copyright law, public procurement law and open source community norms creates many issues relating to the legal status and ownership in modified software, based on open source. This is especially so in the case of so-called copyleft open source licenses, where a collision occurs between copyright, as an absolute right enforceable against the world, and the copyleft provisions of license agreements, which may be treated as “rights in personam” enforceable only against the licensee. The exclusive right to derivative software as an independent object of copyright, may come into conflict with restrictions inherited from incoming copyleft licenses. This paper provides an overview and analysis of such problems faced by Russian software developers, attempting to comply with Russian import substitution provisions, by using open source components. Although it is based on Russian law, it may be applicable to other jurisdictions, since general aspects of copyright law and its interaction with private international law and contract law drive it. The paper concludes that the developer of software, containing code licensed under GPL or other copyleft provisions, receives full exclusive right to the derivative software and can commercialize it as he sees appropriate, subject only to possible claims of breach of contract rather than copyright infringement. This opens wide perspectives for using open source components regardless of the type of license used as bricks for building a de-globalized economy and society based on principles of information sovereignty. © 2017 Alexander Savelyev",Derivative computer program; Import substitution; Information sovereignty; Lex protectionis; Open source software,Computer software; Contracts; Copyrights; Digital storage; International law; Laws and legislation; Open systems; Software engineering; Copyright infringement; Economy and society; Information sovereignty; Lex protectionis; Open source communities; Open source license; Open-source components; Private international law; Open source software,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008199934

What both practices have in common is also found in their marginal nature with regard both to institutionalized Moscow Islam and to the fundamentalist trend which is now gathering steam here. This is an attempt to identify some specific features of contemporary Moscow Islam through the analysis of certain practices. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Diaspora; Integration; Migration; Moscow; Religious practices; Ritual; Sufi,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016619436

In native speakers, the study reports an additional processing cost for both overtly and zero-inflected oblique-case nouns compared to the same nouns in the citation form. It is interpreted as the cost of checking the recomposed word within the inflectional paradigm rather than the cost of affix stripping, because there is no affix to strip in zero-inflected words. Conversely, nonnative speakers of Russian in Experiment 1 do not show additional processing costs either for case form or inflection type, which suggests that they do not process the morphological information encoded in the inflection. In Experiment 2, we add a new manipulation to the nonword condition such that the nonwords illegally combine real stems and real inflections to emphasize the need for processing the inflection. This time, nonnative speakers show additional processing costs for oblique-case nouns, and their sensitivity to case increases with proficiency, with only high-proficiency nonnative speakers demonstrating native-like sensitivity. We show that citation forms are processed faster than oblique forms regardless of inflection, and that nonnative speakers’ engagement of morphological information is task and proficiency-dependent. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Auditory lexical access; Decomposition; Inflectional morphology; Lexical decision task; Native; Nonnative,decomposition; human; human experiment; morphology,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996799559

We take into account the dipole correlations within the random phase approximation (RPA), as well as a dielectric heterogeneity in the internal polymer volume relative to the bulk solution. We demonstrate that the dipole correlations of monomers can be taken into account as pairwise ones only when the polymer chain is in a coil conformation. In this case the dipole correlations manifest themselves through the Keesom interactions of the permanent dipoles. On the other hand, the dielectric heterogeneity effect (dielectric mismatch effect) leads to the effective interaction between the monomers of the polymeric coil. Both of these effects can be taken into account by renormalizing the second virial coefficient of the monomer-monomer volume interactions. We establish that in the case when the solvent dielectric permittivity exceeds the dielectric permittivity of the polymeric material, the dielectric mismatch effect competes with the dipole attractive interactions, leading to polymer coil expansion. In the opposite case, both the dielectric mismatch effect and the dipole attractive interaction lead to the polymer coil collapse. We analyse the coil-globule transition caused by the dipole correlations of monomers within the many-body theory. We demonstrate that accounting for the dipole correlations higher than the pairwise ones smooths this pure electrostatics driven coil-globule transition of the polymer chain.

We described the methodology to determine the parameters of the Weibull function, which reflects the density of distribution of probabilities of wind flow speeds at a defined basic height above the surface of the earth using the available data on the average speed at this height and its repetition by gradations. The application of the least square method for determining these parameters, unlike the use of graphical methods, allows performing a statistical assessment of the results of approximation of empirical histograms by the Weibull formula. On the basis of the computer-aided analysis of the statistical data, it was shown that, at a fixed point where the wind speed changes at different heights, the range of parameter variation of the Weibull distribution curve is relatively small, the sensitivity of the function to parameter changes is quite low, and the influence of changes on the shape of speed distribution curves is negligible. Taking this into consideration, we proposed and mathematically verified the methodology of determining the speed parameters of the Weibull function at other heights using the parameter computations for this function at a basic height, which is known or defined by the average speed of wind flow, or the roughness coefficient of the geological substrate. We gave examples of practical application of the suggested methodology in the development of the Atlas of Renewable Energy Resources in Russia in conditions of deficiency of source meteorological data.

During the recent years, it seems like knowledge has become an all-embracing term that has come to stand for all the magic that goes on within contemporary organizations, making them successful. Knowledge is then an immaterial and ubiquitous asset, embodied into individuals and embedded in their routines and artefacts. From this shadowy asset arises the main research purpose of several management scholars: to ascertain the underlying organizational alchemy and the mystery of knowledge. In the managerial literature, when knowledge comes so deeply incorporated within a firm this has been usually reflected in a widely used concept: the knowledge-intensive enterprise, a term that has received significant attention from scholars and researchers, now expressing a category of organizations within academic scientific research.

The contribution of brain activity immediately after an event to memory formation is however less known. Here, we used repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) to investigate the temporal dynamics of episodic memory encoding with a focus on post-stimulus time intervals. At encoding, rTMS was applied during the online processing of the word, at its offset, or 100, 200, 300 or 400 ms thereafter. rTMS was delivered to the left ventrolateral (VLPFC) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). VLPFC rTMS during the first few hundreds of milliseconds after word offset disrupted subsequent recognition accuracy. We did not observe effects of DLPFC rTMS at any time point.

However, in topological insulators, the chemical potential often lies well above this point, where the Dirac cone is strongly anisotropic and its constant energy contour has a snowflake shape. Taking into account this shape, we show that a very exotic pair potential is induced on the topological insulator surface.

Data: Secondary data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 1993 to 2009 was used. Study design: A time-varying coefficient model was constructed using a binary outcome of no enrollment in health insurance plan versus enrolled. The independent variables included age, sex, education, income, work status, race, and number of health conditions. Smooth functions of odds ratios and time were used to produce odds ratio plots. Results: Significant time-varying coefficients were found for all the independent variables with the odds ratio plots showing changing trends except for a constant line for the categories of male, student, and having three health conditions. Some categories showed decreasing disparities, such as the income categories. However, some categories had increasing disparities in health insurance enrollment such as the education and race categories. Conclusions: As the Affordable Care Act is being gradually implemented, studies are needed to provide baseline information about disparities in access to health insurance, in order to gauge any changes in health insurance access.

However, the experimental evidence for it was originally obtained with slightly different TMD fragments used in the two different mimetics, compromising the validity of the comparison. To eliminate ambiguity, we determined the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of the bicelle-incorporated dimer of the EGFR TMD fragment identical to the one previously used in micelles. The NMR results augmented by molecular dynamics simulations confirm the mutual influence of the TMD and lipid environment, as is required for the proposed lipid-mediated activation mechanism.

Verification of axisymmetric compression tests was made by finite-element modelling. Constitutive models of hot deformation were constructed and effective activation energy of hot deformation was determined. It was found that the flow stress is lowered by decreasing the Al3Ni particle size in case of a low 0.03 volume fraction of particles in binary Al–Ni alloys. Intensive softening at large strains was achieved in the alloy with a 0.1 volume fraction of fine Al3Ni particles. Microstructure investigations confirmed that softening is a result of the dynamic restoration processes which were accelerated by fine particles. In contrast, the size of the particles had no influence on the flow stress of ternary Al–Mg–Ni alloy due to significant work hardening of the aluminium solid solution.

We argue that such ceremonies have profound symbolic meanings, namely managing anxiety and signaling commitment, as well as practical importance, particularly when top executives of corporate parents meet with top officials from the host countries at such ceremonies. The database embraces the entire population of public opening ceremonies of new plants of western multinational corporations (MNCs) in Russia from 2012 to 2016. The analysis revealed that in 2016, the unwillingness of both corporate CEOs and local governors to participate in plant opening ceremonies began to increase. More than one-third of plant opening ceremonies in 2016 were low-profile ceremonies ignored by top officials from corporate parents and local authorities from the host country. The growing absence of local governors is attributed to the smaller size of newly opened plants and the impact of sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States and European Union following the inclusion of Crimea into Russia in 2014.

Since the early 1990s, the global neoliberal discourse has served as the backbone for post-Soviet educational ideology. Alongside other major reform initiatives, the ‘quality revolution,’ proclaimed by the Russian Government in the early 1990s, signified a rhetoric shift away from the Soviet-era quality control towards a neoliberal quality assurance paradigm. Through fine-grained textual analysis of policy documents and political statements by key educational stakeholders, the analysis unpacks the discursive underbelly of the new quality paradigm, in an attempt to determine whether a paradigmatic transformation has taken place. The paper argues that despite the nominally proclaimed shift towards a quality assurance model of educational governance, the representation of educational stakeholders and responsibilities within the new quality paradigm continues to correspond to the Soviet-era command-and-control authoritarian model. The study challenges the popular claim of a neoliberal turn in Russian education and suggests that a neoconservative authoritarian approach to education governance has been smuggled in under the disguise of ‘quality assurance.’ © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",education reform; neoliberalism; quality assurance; Russian education,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994620515

These graphs occur in real-life problems when some form of locality may be exploited to reduce their scale. One such example is correspondence graphs derived from data association problems. The new algorithm is based on the bit-parallel kernel used by the BBMC family of published exact algorithms. BBMCW employs a new bitstring encoding that we denote ‘watched’, because it is reminiscent of the ‘watched literal’ technique used in satisfiability and other constraint problems. The new encoding reduces the number of spurious operations computed by the BBMC bit-parallel kernel in large sparse graphs. Moreover, BBMCW also improves on bound computation proposed in the literature for bit-parallel solvers. Experimental results show that the new algorithm performs better than prior algorithms over data sets of both real and synthetic sparse graphs.

However, there is still no consensus in the field as to which tasks should be used to assess WM in aphasia. The two main alternatives are adapted complex span tasks and N-back tasks. Both have been used interchangeably in previous studies of WM in aphasia, even though the correspondence between the two tasks has not been properly established. Aims: The current study investigates the relationship between two WM tasks—complex span and N-back tasks—in a large sample of individuals with aphasia. The relationships of these tasks to measures of language comprehension are also explored, as well as differences in performance patterns between individuals with non-fluent and fluent aphasia. Methods & Resources: Forty-four participants with aphasia (non-fluent: n = 27; fluent: n = 13; mixed: n = 4) were examined with a modified listening span task (Ivanova & Hallowell, 2014), an auditory verbal 2-back task, and a standardised Russian language comprehension test. Outcomes & Results: Results revealed a moderate relationship between the two WM measures, but demonstrated a divergence in terms of their relationship to language comprehension. Performance on the modified listening span task was related to language comprehension abilities, but performance on the 2-back task was not, suggesting that the two tasks primarily index different underlying cognitive mechanisms. Furthermore, the relationship between the modified listening span task and language comprehension was significant for individuals with non-fluent aphasia, but not for those with fluent aphasia. Conclusions: Overall, the data demonstrate that while performance of individuals with aphasia was related on the two tasks, the two tasks cannot be substituted for one another without further inquiries into their underlying differences. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",complex span tasks; fluent aphasia; language comprehension; N-back tasks; non-fluent aphasia; Working memory,adult; aged; aphasia; Article; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; comparative study; conceptual framework; controlled study; female; fluent aphasia; human; male; memory assessment; modified listening span task; neurorehabilitation; non fluent aphasia; speech and language assessment; task performance; working memory,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963620662

Our results indicate that there is no significant impact of GPA on future earnings for male graduates and significant negative impact for female graduates. The effect of GPA on earnings is insignificant for both gender groups if we control for sectoral segregation. The existence of work experience before graduation is the most significant factor that positively affects future wages. Moreover, we observed high returns to current job tenure.

The first (after 1919) phase transition of this sort occurred in the early 1960s and was related to the growth of global informational connectivity after World War II, as well as the improvement of the means of protest self-organization due to the spread of television, portable radio receivers, portable electric loud-speakers and other technologies of the Fourth Kondratieff Cycle.

Since the beginning of the history wars have evolved in parallel with the changes in Society, Technology, Economy, Environment, Politics and Values (STEEPV). The changing circumstances unavoidably affect the characteristics of warfare through its motivations, shape and size. Armies have adapted themselves to these changing characteristics of warfare through Revolutions in Military Affairs (RMAs) by introducing new military concepts and technologies. Based on the overview of the evolution of military technologies and concepts as a response to changing conditions, the aim of the present study is to anticipate what and how future technologies and concepts will shape warfare and drive impending RMAs. To answer this question, first the RMA literature is reviewed within a broader historical context to understand the extent to which military concepts and technologies affected the RMAs. Then, a time-based technological trend analysis is conducted through the analysis of military patents to understand the impact of technological developments on military concepts. Following the historical analyses, two scenarios are developed for the future of military R&D based on ‘concept-driven’ and ‘technology-driven’ factors. The article is concluded with a discussion about the implications of future scenarios for military R&D, and likely RMAs through the changes of concepts and technologies, and possible consequences such as transformations in organizational structures of armies, new skill and capacity requirements, military education systems, and decision-making processes. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Military R&D; Patent analysis; RMA; Scenarios; Warfare,Decision making; Military operations; Patents and inventions; Capacity requirement; Decision making process; Historical analysis; Organizational structures; Patent analysis; Scenarios; Technological development; Technological trends; Engineering education; Patents and inventions; military intervention; property rights; research and development; technological development; war,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027918842

It is shown that the regularization result asymptotically coincides with the Erdős formula obtained by using Ramanujan’s formula for the number of variants of the partition of an integer into summands. TheHartley entropy regarded as the logarithm of the number of variants defined by Ramanujan’s exact formula asymptotically coincides with the polylogarithm associated with the entropy of the Bose–Einstein distribution. The fact that these formulas coincide makes it possible to extend the entropy to the domain of the Fermi–Dirac distribution with minus sign. Further, the formulas for the distribution are extended to fractional dimension and also to dimension 1, which corresponds to the Waring problem. The relationship between the resulting formulas and the liquid corresponding to the case of nonpolar molecules is described and the law of phase transition of liquid to an amorphous solid under negative pressure is discussed.

On the basis of a statistical analysis of dictionaries and statistical distributions in languages, we conjecture that the transition from the semiotic communication system of the higher primates to human language can be described as a phase transition of the first kind. We show that the number of words appearing with frequency 1 in a corpus of texts is equal to the number of ones in the corresponding Fermi–Dirac distribution, while the high frequency of stop-words corresponds to the large number of particles in the Bose condensate, when the number of degrees of freedom is less than two, provided there is a gap in the spectrum.

This letter presents new data from two experiments testing the gradient of IOR with random, continuous cue-target Euclidean distance and cue-target onset asynchrony. These datawere then used to train multiple diffusion models of saccadic and manual reaction time for these cuing experiments.Diffusion models can generate accurate distributions of reaction time data by modeling a response as a buildup of evidence toward a response threshold. If saccadic and attentional IOR are based on similar processes, then differences in distribution will be best explained by adjusting parameter values such as signal and noise within the same model structure.

Characteristics of the deionization processes are shown to depend on the structure of the electric double layer. The time evolutions of fields of solution concentration were calculated from process beginning. The results are in agreement with experimental data which supports the model. This allows determining the optimal conditions for deionization processes. It is shown that both deionization and concentration are enhanced at an increase in voltage and at a decrease in the solution flow rate.

In this study, we tested our hypothesis that the biologically active concentration of noradrenaline (NA) in blood in perinatal ontogenesis of rats is maintained due to humoral interaction between its central and peripheral sources based on their plasticity. As one of the mechanisms of plasticity, we examined changes in the secretory activity (spontaneous and stimulated release of NA) of NA-producing organs under deficiency of its synthesis in the brain. The destruction of NA-ergic neurons was provoked by administration of a hybrid molecular complex–antibodies against dopamine-β-hydroxylase associated with the cytotoxin saporin–into the lateral cerebral ventricles of neonatal rats. We found that 72 h after the inhibition of NA synthesis in the brain, its spontaneous release from hypothalamus increased, which was most likely due to a compensatory increase of NA secretion from surviving neurons and can be considered as one of the mechanisms of neuroplasticity aimed at the maintenance of its physiological concentration in peripheral blood. Noradrenaline secretion from peripheral sources (adrenal glands and the organ of Zuckerkandl) also showed a compensatory increase in this model. Thus, during the critical period of morphogenesis, the brain is integrated into the system of NA-producing organs and participates in their reciprocal humoral regulation as manifested in compensatory enhancement of NA secretion in each of the studied sources of NA under specific inhibition of NA production in the brain. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",adrenal glands; brain; neonatal; neuroplasticity; noradrenaline; organ of Zuckerkandl; rats,"dopamine beta monooxygenase; noradrenalin; ribosome inactivating protein 1; saporin; adrenal gland; adrenergic nerve cell; animal; brain ventricle; chromaffin system; growth, development and aging; hypothalamus; male; metabolism; rat; secretion (process); Wistar rat; Adrenal Glands; Adrenergic Neurons; Animals; Cerebral Ventricles; Dopamine beta-Hydroxylase; Hypothalamus; Male; Norepinephrine; Para-Aortic Bodies; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014932919

The current situation in the TPP modernization trends is analyzed. The updated initial figures of the capital and operation costs are presented and the obtained estimates of the comparative efficiency of various investment decisions on modernization and equipment replacement at gas-and-oil-burning and coal-fired TPPs with regard to the main zones of the national Unified Power System (UPS) of Russia are cited. The results of optimization of the generating capacity structure underlie a study of alternative TPP modernization strategies that differ in the scope of switching to new technologies, capital intensity, and energy efficiency (decrease in the average heat rate). To provide an integral economic assessment of the above strategies, the authors modified the traditional approach based on determination of the overall discounted costs of power supply (least-cost planning) supplemented with a comparison by the weighted average wholesale price of the electricity. A method for prediction of the wholesale price is proposed reasoning from the direct and dual solutions of the optimization problem. The method can be adapted to various combinations of the mechanisms of payment for the electricity and the capacity on the basis of marginal and average costs. Energy and economic analysis showed that the opposite effects of reduction in the capital investment and fuel saving change in a nonlinear way as the scope of the switch to more advanced power generation technologies at the TPPs increases. As a consequence, a strategy for modernization of the existing power plants rational with respect to total costs of the power supply and wholesale electricity prices has been formulated. The strategy combines decisions on upgrade and replacement of the equipment at the existing power plants of various types. The basic parameters of the strategy for the future until 2035 are provided. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",assessment of the technical and economic feasibility; efficiency; electrical power industry; investment decisions; modernization; service life of the equipment; thermal power plants,Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Efficiency; Electric power systems; Energy efficiency; Equipment; Fuel economy; Industrial economics; Modernization; Optimization; Thermoelectric power plants; Uninterruptible power systems; Comparative efficiencies; Comprehensive assessment; Economic feasibilities; Electrical power industry; Investment decisions; Modernization strategy; Power generation technology; Thermal power plants; Investments,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013888143

This model enables us to bridge the divide between Niklas Luhmann’s theory of the self-organization of meaning in communications and empirical research using information theory. First, we distinguish between communication relations and correlations among patterns of relations. The correlations span a vector space in which relations are positioned and can be provided with meaning. Second, positions provide reflexive perspectives. Whereas the different meanings are integrated locally, each instantiation opens global perspectives – ‘horizons of meaning’ – along eigenvectors of the communication matrix. These next-order codifications of meaning can be expected to generate redundancies when interacting in instantiations. Increases in redundancy indicate new options and can be measured as local reduction of prevailing uncertainty (in bits). The systemic generation of new options can be considered as a hallmark of the knowledge-based economy. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",codification; horizontal and vertical differentiation; redundancy; reflection; triple helix,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012226096

Numerous experiments aimed to reveal these instabilities were not entirely convincing. In particular, spin susceptibility of itinerant electrons, determined from quantum oscillations, remains finite at the critical density of the 2D metal-insulator transition (MIT), n = n c . In contrast, the susceptibility and effective mass determined from high field magnetotransport were reported to diverge. Later, it became clear that as interactions grow, the homogeneous 2D Fermi liquid breaks into a two phase state which hampers interpretation of the experimental data. The thermodynamic magnetization measurements have revealed spontaneous formation of the spin-polarized collective electron droplets (“nanomagnets”) in the correlated 2D Fermi liquid, while the spin susceptibility of itinerant electrons in the surrounding 2D “Fermi sea” remains finite. Here, we report how the non Fermi-liquid two-phase state (dilute ferromagnet) reveals itself in magnetotransport and zero field transport. We found in the correlated 2D system a novel energy scale T ∗ &lt;T F . At T≈T ∗ the in-plane field magnetotransport and zero field transport exhibit features. Finally, in thermodynamic magnetization, the spin susceptibility per electron, ∂χ/∂n changes sign at T≈T ∗ . All three notable temperatures are close to each other, behave critically, ∝ (n− n c ) ; we associate, therefore, T ∗ with a novel energy scale caused by interactions in the two-phase 2DE system. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Magnetotransport; Spin magnetization; Strongly correlated electrons; Two-dimensional system,Fermi liquids; Fermions; Galvanomagnetic effects; Liquids; Magnetic susceptibility; Magnetization; Metal insulator boundaries; Metal insulator transition; Semiconductor insulator boundaries; Superconducting materials; 2D Metal-insulator transitions; Correlated electron systems; Magnetization measurements; Spin magnetization; Spontaneous formation; Strongly correlated electrons; Two Dimensional (2 D); Two-dimensional systems; Electrons,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982803345

We based hypotheses on the growth versus self-protection orientation and person-focus versus social-focus motivations that underlie values. As predicted, openness to change values (growth/person) correlated positively with subjective well-being (SWB: higher LS, lower DEP) and conservation values (self-protection/social) correlated negatively with SWB. The combination of underlying motivations also explained more complex direct relations of self-transcendence and self-enhancement values with SWB. We combined an analysis of the environmental context in societies low versus high in Cultural Egalitarianism with the implications of pursuing person-focused versus social-focused values to predict how Cultural Egalitarianism moderates value–SWB relations. As predicted, under low versus high Cultural Egalitarianism, (i) openness to change values related more positively to SWB, (ii) conservation values more negatively, (iii) self-enhancement values less negatively and (iv) self-transcendence values less positively.

Building upon a recently developed homeostatic reinforcement learning theory, the authors focus on a key transition stage of addiction that is well modeled in animals, escalation of drug use, and propose a computational theory of cocaine addiction where cocaine reinforces behavior due to its rapid homeostatic corrective effect, whereas its chronic use induces slow and long-lasting changes in homeostatic setpoint. Simulations show that our new theory accounts for key behavioral and neurobiological features of addiction, most notably, escalation of cocaine use, drug-primed craving and relapse, individual differences underlying dose-response curves, and dopamine D2-receptor downregulation in addicts. The theory also generates unique predictions about cocaine self-administration behavior in rats that are confirmed by new experimental results.

The characteristics of the low-temperature transport properties of the orthorhombic Fe(SeS) samples are largely determined by the presence of a small number of highly mobile carriers, which may originate from the local regions of the Fermi surface, presumably, nearby the Van Hove singularity points.

Moreover, actions may have non-deterministic effects, i.e. they may have different outcomes whenever applied. We present a formal semantics of our model based on focused proofs of linear logic with definitions. We also determine the computational complexity of various planning problems. Plan compliance problem, for example, is the problem of finding a plan that leads from an initial state to a desired goal state without reaching any undesired critical state.

Under this assumption on actions, we show that the plan compliance problem is PSPACE-complete when all actions have only deterministic effects and is EXPTIME-complete when actions may have non-deterministic effects. Finally, we show that the restrictions on the form of actions and time constraints taken in the specification of our model are necessary for decidability of the planning problems. © 2015 Cambridge University Press.",,Critical current density (superconductivity); Formal methods; Semantics; Clinical investigation; Compliance checking; Financial process; Governmental agency; Institutional policies; Multiset rewriting; Pre and post conditions; Quality of results; Compliance control,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930365292

PFC spontaneous default activity is altered in neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia - a disorder that can be accompanied by heavy smoking. Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human CHRNA5 gene, encoding the α5 nAChR subunit, that increase the risks for both smoking and schizophrenia. Mice with altered nAChR gene function exhibit PFC-dependent behavioral deficits, but it is unknown how the corresponding human polymorphisms alter the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying behavior. Here we show that mice expressing a human α5 SNP exhibit neurocognitive behavioral deficits in social interaction and sensorimotor gating tasks. Two-photon calcium imaging in awake mouse models showed that nicotine can differentially influence PFC pyramidal cell activity by nAChR modulation of layer II/III hierarchical inhibitory circuits. In α5-SNP-expressing and α5-knockout mice, lower activity of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) interneurons resulted in an increased somatostatin (SOM) interneuron inhibitory drive over layer II/III pyramidal neurons. The decreased activity observed in α5-SNP-expressing mice resembles the hypofrontality observed in patients with psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and addiction. Chronic nicotine administration reversed this hypofrontality, suggesting that administration of nicotine may represent a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of schizophrenia, and a physiological basis for the tendency of patients with schizophrenia to self-medicate by smoking. © 2017 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

A significant part of the Russianspeaking writers of Ukraine supported the ""Revolution of Dignity"" in Kyiv and morally opposed the Russian annexation of Crimea and the subsequent military intervention in Eastern Ukraine. One of the main features of the new ""anti-imperialist"" poetry of Ukraine is the critical deconstruction of the collectivist mobilizing ideologies that are so widespread in contemporary Russia and partly in Ukraine. I argue that the aesthetics of this deconstruction may be interpreted as a reconsideration of the traditions of the so-called uncensored Russian poetry which originated in Soviet times. This branch of Russian poetry relies on the critical analysis of and moral resistance to the Soviet hierarchical canon and any ""centralized"" style. Thus the uncensored poetry provided the aesthetic tools also for the deconstruction of the Soviet, post-Soviet, and neoimperialist rhetoric of political ""unity"" and ""entity"" of the ""Russian World."" My argument is that a ""tropological deconstruction,"" which, according to Gayatri Spivak, is necessary for postcolonial writing and reading, is significant for the contemporary Russian poetry of Ukraine, and that the methods of this deconstruction strongly resemble, if not directly continue the methods of the Russian uncensored literature which, however, for the most part had no overt anti-colonial content.",,,English,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034011640

We have performed an econometric modeling and regression analysis on a set of data that were obtained from a survey of Moscow university freshmen to show that high school graduates with high scores on the Unified State Exam (USE) really are oriented toward branded universities and that these prospective students believe that obtaining a prestigious degree is even more important than entering any particular profession. Entrants lack complete information about the quality of education at any given university. The analysis of university rankings presented in this article shows that they are unable to completely solve this information asymmetry since they contain signal distortions introduced by their ranking methodology. These rankings primarily prioritize the research activity of faculty members, and they ignore their teaching performance and work with students. Therefore, often universities design their policies in such a way as to privilege the criteria that are used in rankings, and they focus on improving precisely these indicators at the expense of other considerations. As a result, branded universities are able to distinguish themselves from conventional higher education institutions not by actually providing higher quality educational services, but by selecting the best applicants and benefiting from the powerful peer effect of having these students study together. In this way, these universities can produce excellent graduates that ensure their positive reputation in the eyes of employers and at the same time increase their brand value by raising their position in the rankings. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039418132

The former is ascribed to the influence of an electric field on the transport process itself affecting at least one of the model parameters. The latter should be associated with the mobility field effect under conditions when neither model parameter is field sensitive. Numerical calculations have been used to achieve their deconvolution. On the experimental front, we relied on the time of flight technique specifically modified to suit this task.

One of the possible explanations of SSM errors is perceptual set. After the first target has been found, the subjects become biased to find perceptually similar targets, therefore they are more likely to find perceptually similar targets and less likely to find the targets that are perceptually dissimilar. This study investigated the role of perceptual similarity in SSM errors. The search array in each trial consisted of 20 stimuli (ellipses and crosses, black and white, small and big, oriented horizontally and vertically), which could contain one, two or no targets. In case of two targets, the targets could have two, three or four shared features (in the last case the targets were identical). The error rate decreased with increasing the similarity between the targets.

The Soviet government was strongly committed to the expansion of education across the country, and gender equality was achieved at that time. In the 1990s and 2000s enrolments more than doubled, though the growth of numbers has been reversed since 2008 because of demographic decline of the relevant age cohorts. Employing Trow’s analysis of the growth of higher education systems and Hirsch’s concept of positional goods, among other conceptual approaches, as well as statistical, national, and comparative survey data, this paper analyses social dynamics of the process of increasing participation and equalization of opportunity in Russia. The dramatic higher education expansion in Russia was largely associated with the positional value of higher education credentials, in a society in which the Soviet system of social status had been discontinued, and a new system of status was being built on the basis of post-Soviet rules (which are still evolving). Driven by family aspirations and resources, massification has largely rested on the part-privatisation of the costs of higher education, part of a neoliberal reform package common to the post-Soviet countries. However, higher education expansion has not brought about greater social equity. Expansion, fee-based financing and policy measures such as university excellence initiatives have tended to strengthen the institutional and social stratification of the higher education system, weakening social mobility and social equality. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Educational inequality; Marketization of higher education; Massification of higher education; Neoliberalism; Russian higher education,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964334293

Following this logic, consistent democracies and autocracies are more stable regimes, whereas intermediate regimes (anocracies) display the lowest levels of political stability. We re-test this hypothesis using a data set that has not been previously used for this purpose, finding sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis pertaining to the aforementioned U-shaped relationship. Our analysis is specifically focused on the symmetry of this U shape, whereby our findings suggest that the U-shaped relationship between regime types and sociopolitical destabilization is typically characterized by an asymmetry, with consistently authoritarian regimes being generally less stable than consolidated democracies. We also find that the character of this asymmetry can change with time. In particular, our re-analysis suggests that U-shaped relationship experienced significant changes after the end of the Cold War. Before the end of the Cold War (1946-1991), the asymmetry of inverted U-shaped relationship was much less pronounced—though during this period consistent authoritarian regimes were already less stable than consolidated democracies, this very difference was only marginally significant. In the period that follows the end of the Cold War (1992-2014), this asymmetry underwent a substantial change: Consolidated democracies became significantly more stable, whereas consolidated autocracies became significantly more unstable. As a result, the asymmetry of the U-shaped relationship has become much more pronounced.

We find that people, who place stronger emphasis on postmaterialist values, tend to justify bribery more. However, the “ecological” effect of postmaterialism operates in the exactly opposite direction: A higher prevalence of postmaterialist values induces more bribery disapproval, and especially among postmaterialists themselves. In our view, this happens because the large number of people who internalized postmaterialist values generate positive social externalities which strengthen negative attitudes toward corruption. We outline a theoretical framework that explains why and how these externalities may emerge. Our results contribute to the literature on the sociocultural factors of corruption, provide a better understanding of the complex nature of postmaterialism, and also might be interesting in the light of ongoing discussions on whether moral attitudes are culturally universal or culturally specific. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.",bribery; corruption; moral attitudes; multilevel; postmaterialist values,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008693359

The question matters for understanding determinants of wage differences that have attracted so much attention among economists in the past decade. Evidence indicates that markers for early testosterone exposure are correlated with traits like risk-taking and aggressiveness. But it is not at all clear how such findings might map into labor market success. We combine unique data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey with measured markers (2D:4D ratios) for testosterone exposure and find that lower digit ratios (higher T) correlate with higher wages for women and for men, when controlling for age, education and occupation. There is also some evidence of a potential non-linear, inverse U-effect of digit ratios on wages but this is sensitive to choice of specification. These findings are consistent with earlier work on prenatal T and success in careers (Coates et al., 2009) but inconsistent with the work of Gielen et al.

It remains unclear whether rsFC is changed at the network level as was shown for major depressive disorder (MDD). To address this question, we investigated rsFC of resting sate networks (RSNs) in PSD. Methods Eleven subjects with PSD underwent fMRI scanning at rest before and after treatment. The severity of depression was assessed using the aphasic depression rating scale (ADRS). We performed functional network connectivity (FNC) analysis for RSNs, region of interest – FC analysis (ROI-FC) and calculation of brain matter volumes in ROIs overlapping with RSNs and in other brain regions associated with mood maintenance. Results We found positive correlation of FNC between anterior default mode network (aDMN) and salience network (SAL) with depression severity before treatment, the latter accompanied by the increase of white matter in the middle frontal and left angular gyri. FNC of aDMN and left frontoparietal network (LFP) decreased after treatment. ROI-FC and the brain matter volumes of several regions of DMN, LFP and SAL also showed a correlation with ADRS or significant change after treatment. Limitations Limitations include small sample size and methodological issues concerning altered hemodynamics in stroke. However, we took complex preprocessing steps to overcome these issues. Conclusion Present results of altered rsFC in PSD are consistent with previous findings in MDD. The convergence of results obtained in PSD and MDD supports the validity of rsFC approach for investigation of brain network dysfunctions underling these psychiatric symptoms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",fMRI; Functional network connectivity; Post-stroke depression; Resting state,adult; angular gyrus; Aphasic Depression rating scale; Article; brain ischemia; brain region; brain size; clinical article; correlation analysis; default mode network; disease severity; female; frontoparietal cortex; frontoparietal network; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gray matter; human; image analysis; male; middle aged; mood; nerve cell network; post-stroke depression; priority journal; rating scale; resting state network; salience network; white matter; aged; brain mapping; cerebrovascular accident; depression; diagnostic imaging; frontal lobe; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parietal lobe; pathophysiology; procedures; psychological rating scale; psychology; rest; Aged; Brain Mapping; Depression; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Net; Parietal Lobe; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Rest; Stroke; White Matter,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034432099

Methodology: The study consisted of three experiments. A sentence–picture matching task was designed to assess the activation of grammaticalized meaning. The participants were asked to judge if a sentence correctly described the physical relationships of three objects in a picture. Hidden in the stimuli that required a positive response was a number agreement manipulation whereby a noun phrase in the sentence may agree or disagree with the number of objects in the picture. A number disagreement effect, as shown in a delay in producing a positive response on items of number disagreement was used to assess automatic activation of number meanings. Data and Analysis: The data constituted reaction times and accuracy rates from 32 English native speakers, 36 Chinese native speakers, 54 Chinese–English bilinguals, and 26 Russian–English bilinguals. Analyses of variance were performed in analyzing these data. Findings: The results showed a number disagreement effect in L1 and L2 among Russian English as a second language (ESL) speakers only. Chinese ESL speakers showed no difference between the two critical conditions in either language. A follow-up experiment showed that Chinese ESL speakers had no difficulty in automatically activating number meanings which were expressed lexically in English sentence processing. These findings provided support for the idea that the well documented difficulty L2 learners have in learning incongruent L2 inflectional morphemes may have to do with their difficulty in automatically activating a grammaticalized meaning that is not grammaticalized in their L1. Originality: The sentence–picture matching task represented a unique and effective approach to the study of the activation of grammaticalized meanings.

In voltage-biased junctions, this creates favorable conditions for strong nonequilibrium of quasiparticles in the junction plates and leads, produced by multiparticle tunneling. We study theoretically the interplay between the nonequilibrium and relaxation processes in such junctions and found that nonequilibrium in the leads noticeably modifies the currentvoltage characteristic at eV > 2D, especially the excess current, whereas strong diffusive relaxation restores the result of the classical tunnel model. At eV > 2D, the diffusive relaxation decreases the peaks of the multiparticle currents. The inelastic relaxation in the junction plates essentially suppresses the n-particle currents (n > 2) by the factor n for odd and n 2 for even n.

However, the data on the existence of monoenzymatic neurons in the striatum remain controversial, and little is known about their functional significance. The aim of this study was to test our hypothesis that monoenzymatic TH-containing neurons produce DA in cooperation with the neurons containing AADC, which might help to compensate DA deficiency under the failure of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. Using a combination of techniques: retrograde tracing, qPCR and immunolabeling for TH, AADC and MAP2, we showed that the striatum of mice with normal and degraded dopaminergic system comprises of monoenzymatic TH- and AADC-containing neurons. To provide evidence for cooperative synthesis of DA, we used an ex vivo model of inhibiting of DA synthesis by blocking transport of L-DOPA, produced in monoenzymatic TH-containing neurons, to neurons containing AADC by means of L-leucine, a competitive inhibitor of the membrane transporter of large neutral amino acids, and L-DOPA. With this original approach, cooperative synthesis of DA in the striatum was proven in MPTP-treated mice but not in the control. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the proportion of DA produced through cooperative synthesis in the striatum of MPTP-treated mice increases as the degradation of dopaminergic system proceeds. An increase in the proportion of cooperative synthesis of DA alongside degradation of the dopaminergic system is also proved by an increase of both TH gene expression and the number of TH-immunoreactive structures in the striatum. Thus, these data suggest that the cooperative synthesis of DA in the degraded striatum is an up-regulated compensatory reaction, which plays an increasing role as DA deficiency rises, and might be considered among the principal mechanisms of neuroplasticity in neurodegenerative diseases. © 2016","1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase; Mice; Nigrostriatal system; Parkinson's disease; Tyrosine hydroxylase","1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 1 methyl 4 phenylpyridine; amino acid decarboxylase; leucine; levodopa; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; aromatic levo amino acid decarboxylase; dopamine; dopamine beta monooxygenase; messenger RNA; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody labeling; Article; brain nerve cell; controlled study; corpus striatum; degenerative disease; dopamine metabolism; dopaminergic system; ex vivo study; male; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nigroneostriatal system; nonhuman; parkinsonism; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; cingulate gyrus; intoxication; metabolism; nerve cell; olfactory bulb; pathology; substantia nigra; tissue culture technique; Animals; Aromatic-L-Amino-Acid Decarboxylases; Corpus Striatum; Dopamine; Dopamine beta-Hydroxylase; Gyrus Cinguli; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; MPTP Poisoning; Neurons; Olfactory Bulb; RNA, Messenger; Substantia Nigra; Tissue Culture Techniques; Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85004064264

Using this approach, material well-being is understood as a generic notion that covers a number of different domains, whereas the concept of domain is used to distinguish between different aspects of people’s resources, including income security, basic needs, durables, housing and subjective material well-being. Each dimension is measured independently, using the best indicators available, to generate a score or domain index for each aspect of material well-being. The procedure of re-weighting the indicators within the separate domains enables us to account for the disparity in resources and consumer preferences across different population subgroups. The final domain scores, combined with explicit weighting, are then used to generate a summary material well-being index. The domain indices and the summary material well-being index are validated by exploring their relationships to key socio-economic attributes, which were previously shown to be strongly associated with individual material well-being. The results showed that the summary indices of material well-being are characterized by greater differentiation in relation to such measures, as occupational class and judgments of satisfaction with one’s life. This allows us to conclude that our summary indices capture the latent concept of material well-being better than any of our domain indices used separately. Although the index is constructed using the Russian Gender and Generation Survey data for 2007, the methodological approach that we applied can be easily replicated in other surveys which contain information on several aspects of material well-being. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Gender and Generation Survey; Household income; Material well-being; Multidimensional index; Reference groups; Russia,gender; household income; quality of life; socioeconomic indicator; socioeconomic survey; Russian Federation,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955295991

We analyze kinetic equations for electron occupation numbers with different spins taking into account high order correlation functions for the localized electrons. We reveal that in the stationary state electron occupation numbers with the opposite spins always have the same value: the stationary state is a “paramagnetic” one. “Magnetic” properties can appear only in the non-stationary characteristics of the single-impurity Anderson model and in the dynamics of the localized electrons second order correlation functions. We found that for deep energy levels and strong Coulomb correlations, relaxation time for initial “magnetic” state can be several orders larger than for “paramagnetic” one. So, long-living “magnetic” moment can exist in the system. We also found non-stationary spin polarized currents flowing in opposite directions for the different spins in the particular time interval. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013076628

While the general acceptability of pre-marital sex was not affected by time spent in London, differences were noted in the meaning attached to sex outside marriage in the United Kingdom compared with Central and Eastern Europe. Particularly significant changes were observed in our respondents’ attitudes towards homosexuality, with a greater liberalisation the result of extrication from mechanisms of social control, re-socialisation into new social norms regarding sex and sexuality, greater visibility of sexual difference in London and, in particular, inter-personal contacts with gays and lesbians.

While many studies support a broadly distributed model of language and semantics grounded, among other things, in the general modality-specific systems, theories disagree as to whether motor and sensory cortex activity observed during language processing is functional or epiphenomenal. Here, we assessed the role of motor areas in linguistic processing by investigating the responses of 28 healthy volunteers to different word types in semantic and lexical decision tasks, following repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of primary motor cortex. We found that early rTMS (delivered within 200 ms of word onset) produces a left-lateralised and meaning-specific change in reaction speed, slowing down behavioural responses to action-related words, and facilitating abstract words – an effect present only during semantic, but not lexical, decision. We interpret these data in light of action-perception theory of language, bolstering the claim that motor cortical areas play a functional role in language comprehension. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Language; Motor cortex; Semantics; TMS,clinical article; comprehension; controlled study; human; language; perception; primary motor cortex; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; semantics; velocity; volunteer; adult; analysis of variance; comprehension; decision making; electroencephalography; female; linguistics; male; motor cortex; photostimulation; physiology; reaction time; transcranial magnetic stimulation; young adult; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Comprehension; Decision Making; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Judgment; Language; Male; Motor Cortex; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Semantics; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Vocabulary; Young Adult,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010390677

The system of unexcited atoms is first placed in a magnetic field that is directed at a magic angle of arccos(1/3)≈54.7° to the line connecting the atoms and has a transverse gradient. The gradient of the field results in the detuning of frequencies of an optical transition of the atoms. Then, the resonant laser excitation of an atom with a higher transition frequency is performed with the subsequent adiabatic switching-off of the gradient of the magnetic field. It is shown that the excited atomic system in this case transits with overwhelming probability to an entangled subradiance state.

These ecosystems extend across different layers including the organisational, sectoral, regional, national and international dimensions. The interconnectedness of these layers has not have received much attention in foresight literature and practise. However, both the development and diffusion of innovations are subject to framework conditions not only within, but also across, multiple layers of innovation ecosystems. The design and management of foresight exercises are thus liable to addressing and serving these different layers — especially when the goal is to improve the performance and impact of such “interconnected and interdependent systems”. This paper develops further the concept of ‘multi-layered foresight’ by addressing multiple layers of innovation ecosystems in foresight design and management. We explore the implications of applying this type of foresight on improving systemic understanding, enhancing stakeholder networking and developing innovation capacities across the layers of ecosystems. The theoretical underpinnings are tested through a case study of the ‘Personal Health Systems (PHS) Foresight’ project. This project explored international future developments in the health sector, which is characterised by multiple disciplines, communities of practise, technologies, and geographical contexts. In the case of PHS the emerging innovation ecosystems are often conditioned by fragmented development communities, major barriers to market development, and duplication of efforts. The project combined analytical, social networking, online envisioning and scenario building methods to address complexity and create impact in multiple layers. Possible futures for personal health systems were explored through intense dialogues with stakeholders and a desirable future state was sketched through the success scenario methodology. The implications and strategic issues for different groups of stakeholders were outlined, enabling these stakeholders to articulate their efforts as part of a broader agenda at the multiple layers of innovation ecosystems. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Coordination; Governance; Innovation ecosystem; Multi-layered foresight; Personal health system,Ecology; Health; Innovation; Communities of practise; Coordination; Development community; Diffusion of innovations; Governance; Interdependent systems; Multi-layered; Personal health systems; Ecosystems; governance approach; innovation; market development; stakeholder; technological development; technology diffusion,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969988519

The problem of algorithmic recognition of c.s.r. property is proved to be polynomially solvable for irreducible semigroups and undecidable for reducible ones. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Convex body; Ellipsoid; Finite matrix group; Fractal curves; Joint spectral characteristics; Linear switching systems; Multiplicative semigroup; Polynomial algorithm; Spectral radius,Dynamical systems; Convex body; Ellipsoid; Finite matrices; Fractal curves; Linear switching systems; Polynomial algorithm; Semi-group; Spectral characteristics; Spectral radii; Matrix algebra,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994339637

The special SPICE models for CMOS transistors with radiation dependent model parameters were used for this purpose. The simulation results showed that total dose results to reducing of IC output current, increasing of IC output voltage rise/fall times and to reduction of parasitic oscillations in PCB traces. The influence of irradiated P-channel MOSFET on transient characteristics is more important than N-MOSFET's influence because of summarized mobility reduction and threshold voltage value increasing. © 2016 IEEE.",board trace; CMOS; IBIS model; integrated circuit; printed circuit board; radiation effects; signal integrity; signal waveform; space telecommunication systems; SPICE model,Circuit simulation; CMOS integrated circuits; Integrated circuits; MOSFET devices; Printed circuit boards; Satellite communication systems; SPICE; Threshold voltage; Timing circuits; board trace; Mobility reduction; Parasitic oscillations; Satellite communications; Signal Integrity; Signal waveform; SPICE modeling; Transient characteristic; Radiation effects,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013658165

The density of states, occupation numbers, and conductance of the structure were analyzed using the nonequilibrium Green's functions in the tight-binding approach and the equation-of-motion method. In particular the anisotropy of hopping integrals and on-site electron energies as well as the effects of the finite intra- and interdot Coulomb interactions were investigated. It was found out that the anisotropy of the kinetic processes in the system leads to the Fano-Feshbach asymmetrical peak. We demonstrated that the conductance of the QQD device has a wide insulating band with steep edges separating triple-peak structures if the intradot Coulomb interactions are taken into account. The interdot Coulomb correlations between the central QDs result in the broadening of this band and the occurrence of an additional band with low conductance due to the Fano antiresonances. It was shown that in this case the conductance of the anisotropic QQD device can be dramatically changed by tuning the anisotropy of on-site electron energies. © 2017 American Physical Society.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010716332

Such preferences are only required to hold when the alternatives being compared agree on a specified subset of propositional variables. Regarding the expressivity of the language in question, we show that a parameterized preference statement is equivalent to a conjunction of an exponential number of classical, non-parameterized, ceteris paribus statements. Next, we present an inference system for parameterized statements and prove that the problem of checking the semantic consequence relation for such statements is coNP-complete. We propose an approach based on formal concept analysis to learning preferences from data by showing that ceteris paribus preferences valid in a particular model correspond to implications of a special formal context derived from this model. The computation of a complete preference set is then reducible to the computation of minimal hypergraph transversals. Finally, we adapt a polynomial-time algorithm for abduction using Horn clauses represented by their characteristic models to the problem of determining preferences over new alternatives from preferences over given alternatives (with ceteris paribus preferences as the underlying model). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Ceteris paribus preferences; Formal concept analysis; Horn formulas; Implications,Algorithms; Computational linguistics; Formal logic; Information analysis; Logic programming; Parameterization; Polynomial approximation; Semantics; Ceteris paribus; Consequence relations; Horn formulas; Hypergraph transversals; Implications; Polynomial-time algorithms; Propositional language; Propositional variables; Formal concept analysis,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957916916

In this paper we consider finite lattices given by ordered sets of their meet and join irreducibles (i.e., as a concept lattice of a formal context). We show that in this case dualization is equivalent to the enumeration of so-called minimal hypotheses. In contrast to usual dualization setting, where a lattice is given by the ordered set of its elements, dualization in this case is shown to be impossible in output polynomial time unless P = NP. However, if the lattice is distributive, dualization is shown to be possible in subexponential time. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Distributive lattice; Formal concept analysis; Monotone Boolean dualization,Boolean functions; Information analysis; Polynomial approximation; Set theory; Concept Lattices; Distributive lattice; Finite lattices; Formal contexts; Monotone Boolean dualization; Ordered set; Polynomial-time; Subexponential time; Formal concept analysis,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957828036

Different network states are considered. Regular and chaotic states of networks are described. A new model of a social microblogging network as a point dissipative system is suggested. Dynamic variables of such system are represented by the variations of tweet/retweet number around the equilibrium values. It is pointed out, that the system is in a condition of an asymptotically stable equilibrium when the intensity values of an external information are small (the number of tweets eventually tends to its equilibrium value). So far as the intensity values of external information do not exceed the critical value, the stable (almost harmonic) oscillations of tweets take place in the system. If the intensity values of external information exceed the critical value, then the chaotic oscillations of tweets are to be observed. A case of Twitter network is examined. © 2016 IEEE.",chaotic state; regular state; Social media monitoring; social network,Electronic commerce; Asymptotically stable equilibrium; Chaotic oscillation; Chaotic state; Dissipative systems; Evolutionary dynamics; External informations; regular state; Social media monitoring; Social networking (online),English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013059168

Current studies of detention spaces for migrants have drawn heavily on Agamben’s reflection on the “camp” and “homo sacer,” where the camp is analyzed as a space in a permanent state of exception, in which the government exercises sovereign power over the refugee as the ultimate biopolitical subject. But what groups of people can end up at a camp, and does the government treat all groups in the same way? This article examines the German camp for repatriates, refugees, and asylum seekers as a space where the state’s borders are demarcated and controlled through practices of bureaucratic and narrative differentiation among various groups of people. The author uses the concept of detention space to draw a theoretical link between national identity and biopolitics, and demonstrates how the sovereign’s practices of control and differentiation at the camp construct German national identity through defining “nonmembers” of the state.

They stood in the way of fusing rhetoric and dialectic, the goal of sixteenth-century ‘humanistic’ logic: the project of a unified theory of invention depends on the exclusion of loci personarum from the domain of dialectic proper. But still they cannot easily be replaced in the class room. Bartholomaeus Keckermann resolved these difficulties: he proposed to abandon the notion that loci personarum could play a role in finding new arguments concerning persons. So they pose no risks for a unified theory of invention, because they can only be used for the exposition of information that we already have. Since loci personarum are concerned with individuals, the knowledge about individuals that is available to us is inescapably circumstantial and contingent, defying the claim of generality or necessity of dialectic made by Keckermann’s sixteenth-century predecessors. However, our thinking about persons is primarily interested in those aspects that we do not share with other members of our species.

While there is an extensive literature assessing the successes and failures of international sanctions on the economies of both those imposing and targeted by sanctions on a macroeconomic level, we are more interested in trying to understand the corporate response–i.e. which firms evaluate the introduction and increasing scale of economic sanctions as a threat to their corporate strategy, and their possible reactions aimed at adjusting to a changing environment due to the geopolitical shock. Our research, based on a recent survey of manufacturing companies, provides evidence that over the last decade Russian manufacturing firms have become much more integrated into the global economy than is commonly assumed, through foreign direct investment, foreign trade (including imports of both technological equipment and raw materials and components), international partnerships, and by extensively supplying foreign companies that operate in Russia. Considering the self-selection effect of the top-performing firms in terms of foreign trade, we can state that sanctions could prove most harmful not only for the targeted firms, but for the entire population of better-performing and globalized firms involved in foreign trade with the EU and Ukraine. Thus, the impact of the sanctions on the prospects of the Russian manufacturing sector may be very strong over the medium-to-long term. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Economic sanctions; manufacturing firms; perceptions of risks; Russia,environmental change; European Union; geopolitics; global economy; international trade; macroeconomics; manufacturing; risk factor; risk perception; Russian Federation; Ukraine; United States,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974822317

Furthermore, this paper discusses the question whether Moscow has radically changed its Arctic strategies in the context of the Ukrainian crisis or its course basically remained the same? Based on the analysis of Russia’s principal doctrinal documents, this article explores Moscow’s threat perceptions and its strategic priorities in the Arctic. The authors emphasise the inward-, rather than outward-looking nature of Russia’s Arctic strategy which focuses on numerous economic, societal, environmental and socio-cultural problems of the Russian North. In fact, Moscow’s international strategy in the region is subordinated to its domestic needs. On the other hand, Russia’s preoccupation with its internal problems does not preclude the Kremlin from a rather assertive international course when it comes to the protection of Russia’s national interests in the Arctic. In this context, the authors analyse Moscow’s renewed claim on the expansion of the Russian continental shelf and military modernisation programmes.

Traditional family values are central to the church’s rhetoric. The authors of these texts see a presumed decay of traditional values as the main danger that must be opposed. They usually trace the source of this danger directly to the contemporary West. By contrast, they see Russia as a protective shield against these global influences. Either consciously or involuntarily, they translate their religious language of traditional morality into a political rhetoric of solidarity and patriotism. Such ideological rhetoric has direct political implications and analogies in the agenda of Putin’s regime. This Russian appeal to ‘traditional values’, both religious and political, has recently acquired an extraordinary international relevance. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",abortion; juvenile court; morality; Russia; Russian Orthodox Church; solidarity; traditional values; USSR legacy,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009282271

This in particular implies existence of a full exceptional collection, which is a refinement of Kapranov's collection [13], which was constructed over a field of characteristic zero. We also describe the right dual semi-orthogonal decomposition which has a similar form, and its components are full subcategories of the derived category of representations of GLn−k. The resulting equivalences between the components of the two decompositions are given by a version of Koszul duality for strict polynomial functors. We also construct a tilting vector bundle on Gr(k,n). We show that its endomorphism algebra has two natural structures of a split quasi-hereditary algebra over Z, and we identify the objects of Db(Gr(k,n)), which correspond to the standard and costandard modules in both structures.

A ubiquitous information medium used by humans is spoken language, but the neural dynamics of its comprehension is still poorly understood. Here, we scrutinized the earliest electrophysiological activity elicited in the human brain by spoken words and matched meaningless word-like stimuli using a lexical auditory oddball paradigm, an established technique for investigating cortical activation patterns underlying early automatic stages of language processing. We show that the earliest cortical reflection of word comprehension takes place during the electrophysiological P1 evoked response, at about 30 ms following the word disambiguation point, and takes the form of an enhanced brain activation for familiar meaningful words, even when they are presented outside the focus of attention.

We conducted a series of list experiments in early 2015 to estimate support for Putin while allowing respondents to maintain ambiguity about whether they personally do so. Our estimates suggest support for Putin of approximately 80%, which is within 10 percentage points of that implied by direct questioning. We find little evidence that these estimates are positively biased due to the presence of floor effects. In contrast, our analysis of placebo experiments suggests that there may be a small negative bias due to artificial deflation.

Surprisingly, historical ethnography of Nukuria is possible in spite of the fact that the atoll was discovered almost two hundred years ago and in spite of the fact that the population was devastated by post-contact diseases and reduced to 15 persons in the late 1800s.

We consider this factor as an indicator of the professional knowledge capitalization that can be used as a proxy for human capital stock in extended Cobb-Douglas type equation for modeling the economic growth. Identification of the indicator is based on time-series data on countries and regional economies. To divide the objects into groups with respect to the aggregate return to education, we employ the fuzzy classification methodology instead of the traditional clustering procedure. This approach provides more relevant dividing the whole sample into three homogeneous groups. The first group includes the economies with low level of innovation development. These economies have close to zero or negative rate of return to education. The second group is most numerous. It mostly consists of developed economies with moderate aggregate rate of return to education. The third group includes objects with high return to education. It turned out that they are predominantly emerging economies developing on the base of new technologies. Such a typology provides the opportunities to make some suggestions concerning the relation between innovation development and quality of human capital stock. In particular, high rate of return to education in emerging economies we explain by the excess demand on high-qualified staff on the labor market that cannot be fully satisfied by existing educational system in the economies with higher level of innovation potential. Conversely, in developed economies, educational system meets the demand of the labor market, so the aggregate return to education is not so high. So it is necessary to be more specific about the structure of educational system for preparing high qualified staff for the most promising directions of innovation development. Comprehensive research of the considered problem at the regional level requires more elaborated data sources. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

The Russian leadership is well aware of the EU’s “authority orientation” but fails to reliably predict foreign policy at the EU level, whilst the EU realizes Russia’s “coercive orientation” in general, but cannot predict when and where coercive tools will be used next. Russia is gradually realizing the importance of authority, while the EU sees the necessity of coercion tools for coping with certain challenges. The learning process is ongoing but the basic distinction remains unchanged and so their approaches cannot be reconciled as long as both actors exist in their current form.

This section (now chapters III-VI), being the oldest part of the Bull, appeared as contamination of two originally independent edicts. Nevertheless, the main idea of ceremonies described in both of them is the same: establishing of a concordia, political harmony, within the small group of leading princes of the empire. To achieve this harmony, some changes of hierarchical relations were necessary. The authors of the Golden Bull imagined the reformed Empire visualised as a symmetric figure, built by the princes' seats and bodies as if seen from above, by drawing a plan of their collocation at ceremonial acts. At the same time, the authors strongly emphasized parity between the three archbishops, but secured two sorts of inequality via symbolical means. Firstly, the ecclesiastical electors appear to stand higher in the hierarchy than the secular ones. Secondly, the hierarchy within the group of secular electors was substantially transformed for the benefit of the King of Bohemia and to the prejudice of Count Palatine of the Rhine. It seems also that the authors were preparing for a possible «ceremonial confrontation» with the French court in the near future. © 2017 SISMEL Edizioni del Galluzzo.

In Russia, freedom of speech only emerged as a legal concept in 1990 on the eve of the collapse of the USSR. While the public had considerable hopes, in those halcyon days, for generating an open society free from censorship or state pressure, those hopes soon dissolved. Perhaps history now sheds light on why that was the case. In the last few years, scholars and experts have noted increasing attempts by the Russian government to intensify control over speech, particularly online speech. This poses several questions, which this chapter will try to answer: Why is this happening? What is the real meaning of the concept of free speech in Russia? How has it been impacted by Soviet ideology and legislation? How has the Russian concept of free speech been affected by international standards? The chapter begins with an analysis of the Soviet perspective on speech and the press, particularly how Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet Constitutions shaped the concept, and then proceeds to examine glasnost. The chapter then studies concepts related to speech in legislation concerning mass media, followed by the modern Russian constitutional concept of free speech, showing how it has been interpreted and implemented in legislation as well as in the practice of the highest Russian courts. THE SOVIET PERSPECTIVE ON FREE SPEECH Marxism-Leninism is a key theory underpinning the Soviet perspective on speech and the press in the construction of society. It was recognized as the party’s leading ideology in the USSR’s 1936 Constitution and proclaimed as the country’s official ideology in the next USSR Constitution of 1977. It should be noted, however, that Karl Marx was not a Russian author, he was not thinking of Russia when he elaborated his theories and he did not even play a role in the Russian revolutions, unlike Vladimir Lenin. Marxism-Leninism was developed by Lenin to represent his understanding of Marx’s ideas. © Cambridge University Press 2018.",,,English,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048745624

The analysis of the recently introduced innovations reveals that bankruptcy legislation still does not take into account the subtleties of corporate legislation and the specifics of the position of sole executive body (or the ""head of the debtor"" in the terminology of the Bankruptcy Act) in the corporate management system.

Reasons preventing a direct comparison of data on internal migration in Russia and other countries are analyzed. They are related to differences in the size of units of administrative and territorial division and diversity in approaches to the definition of in-country migration. Based on 2013-2014 migration data of it was concluded that Russia and several countries with advanced migration statistics differ substantially. Russia lags behind the leading countries about twice. However, it overpasses other countries, especially of eastern and southern Europe, in terms of migration intensity. Analysis of internal migration flows by age shows that, in general, Russia and other developed countries have similar age migration profiles. In contrast to other comparable countries, the Russian peak at the age of 15-29 years is more clearly defined and biased to the youngest age. It results from a greater briefness of socio-demographic events, which leads to migration movements. Contrary to our expectations the differences between the age profile of migration in Russia and other countries in the rest of the age groups are not great. © 2017 Moskovskij Universitet.

I propose to seek for such an experience in a typical (for the twentieth-century philosophy) form of a philosophical wonder which I would call the ""oddity of the obvious"". Using the example of the Husserl's and Wittgenstein's philosophies, I try to demonstrate how this experience works, showing the important discrepancy between the two philosophers: a differently placed frontier between the sense and the nonsense. The most striking feature that characterizes the types of philosophical wonder established in the analytical and phenomenological traditions is an element that escapes their view: in the first case it is the being-in-itself which is considered absurd (widersinnig); in the second case it is pre-predicative experience which is proclaimed meaningless (unsinnig). I specify what strategies Husserl and Wittgenstein use, dealing with the experience of the ""oddity of the obvious""; namely, they try either to retain the incomprehensibility of the obvious or to dissolve the ""mental cramp"". The philosophical tradition (phenomenological or analytical one) takes one of the possible forms of the philosophical wonder to be the basic form. For the phenomenological philosophy, quite an emblematic feature is the effort to retain the ""oddity of the obvious"", and for the analytical philosophy (of wittgensteinian provenance)-the dissolution of ""mental cramp"", of philosophical bewilderment, the release from vague intellectual disquiet. Concluding the article, I propose to consider the alteration of the philosophical wonder models as a possibility of overcoming intrashop discrepancies between the philosophical traditions. © GEORGY CHERNAVIN, 2017.",?bviousness; Edmund Husserl; Ludwig Wittgenstein.; Nonsense; Philosophical wonder; Sense,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047794208

Based on the paradigm of ‘leading from the periphery’, this groundbreaking analysis offers an explanation for such spontaneity and apparent lack of leadership in contentious collective action. Contrary to existing theories, the author argues that network effects in collective action originating from marginal leaders can benefit from a total lack of communication. Such network effects persist in isolated islands of contention instead of overarching action cascades, and are shown to escalate in globally dispersed, but locally concentrated networks of contention. This is a trait that can empower marginal leaders and set forth social dynamics distinct from those originating in the limelight. Leading from the Periphery and Network Collective Action provides evidence from two Middle Eastern uprisings, as well as behavioral experiments of collective risk-taking in social networks. © Navid Hassanpour 2016.",,,English,Book,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047354784

However, loyalty of which elites is more important to establish high voting for an autocrat and a high turnout? As elections in electoral autocracies are designed to demonstrate superiority of the autocrat over his rivals, Russian subnational elections serve to legitimatize the leadership of a predecided race favorite rather than establish fair competition. Even given that there is no intrigue in the election outcome, do conflicts still influence the result of voting? And which conflicts prove to be the most influential on the elections result? Basing on empirical evidence of gubernatorial election in Russia we explore how conflicts between the governor and the elites at municipal and regional levels affect incumbents' elections results. We collected electoral data for 43 regions and 1402 municipalities and coded qualitative data on conflicts between governor and elites. We find that conflicts between governors and the mayors of regional capitals have the only robust negative effect on both electoral result and turnout. In the regions with this conflict, governors receive up to about 16 percentage points lower support and 15 percentage point lower turnout. The explanation to the finding bases on the logic of mobilization machinery performance. Encouraging loyalty of these mayors secures smoother political machinery in the most electorally significant areas of the region (regional capitals) and thus has the most pronounced impact on the outcome of an electoral campaign. This finding provides another confirmation of the paramount role of covert rather than open inter-elite competition for electoral autocracies maintenance. © 2017, Noncommercial Partnership Editorial Board Polis.",Clientelism; Electoral autocracy; Elites; Gubernatorial elections; Regional politics; Russian politics; Russian regions; United Russia,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047164193

Both periods parallel some cultural developments in the western world: the 1970s–1980s supposedly saw the rise of late modernity whereby individuals, freed from constraints of social structures, engage in ongoing process of self-reflexivity and self-fashioning, through consumption. In this article, drawing on the interviews with 20 middle-aged women from Moscow, I examine the limitations on self-fashioning as a means of achieving and maintaining a position of privilege. I particularly focus on the women’s concerns about failing to engage in normative practices of self-care, including anti-ageing cosmetic procedures, and hence failing to embody feminine dispositions that had value in their middle-class milieu. The analysis of such concerns helps discern the ways different markers of identity (gender, class and age) interplay and act as enablers or constraints in the mundane struggle for power at the interpersonal level. © 2017, The Author(s) 2017.",age; Consumption; femininity; post-Soviet era; Russia,,English,Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046026701

Yet, the specific methodology of such studies is still not clear. Some legal historians hold the opinion that comparative legal history does not or should not have its own methodology other than that of comparative law. Others warn against imposing on legal history the contemporary agenda and toolbox. The author of this article aims to clarify this debate by examining the prospect of applying one of the most popular methods of comparative law – the functional one – in the domain of legal history. On the basis of several examples from European legal past he claims that examining the functions (the social purpose) of legal norms can help legal historians in three ways. First, to determine the objects of comparison and the sources of analysis, despite the variety of verbal shortcuts (the initial stage of research). Second, to analyse legal norms from the perspective of solving social problems in the past, to study the ‘law in action’. Third, to arrange the results of the research according to meaningful criteria at the final stage. © 2017 STS Science Centre Ltd.

Official discourses describing similar expositions update the memory of collective trauma and Soviet colonialism. However, the traumatic experience and ""naked Soviet ideology, which suppressed and hurt the spirit of the nation"" cannot be reproduced in the aesthetic experience of the open-air museum visitor. To prove this thesis, a dual-methodolo-gical framework is employed: a historical reconstruction of the estimated aesthetic impact of the monument in the place for which it was realized; the analysis of subjective experience of the visitor and the technique of its construction. The article argues that monumental sculpture, whatever its material form, artistic merit and ideological significance in the past, is primarily an art object and exhibit that makes it a potentially attractive item for a collection. The relationship between the material form of the monument and its ideological value is historical; it is connected to the space where the people engage in the collective commemorative practices in accordance with group identity discourses. Soviet monumental propaganda is, first of all, an urban project. The resettlement of the monument from the avenue or square modifies the aesthetic and social experience, depriving it of the ideological value that depends on the circumstances of the exposure. To describe the process of appropriation of the Soviet monumental heritage by moving objects from public urban spaces in a natural (park) landscape, the concept of ""naturalization"" is introduced. The method of preserving objects of monumental propaganda in the landscape environment can be positively understood and described as a retrospective of the national school of monumental sculpture. © 2017 Gaidar Institute Press.

In this optic, utopia ceases to be a mere idealistic vision of the future and becomes, first and foremost, a utopian method and standpoint from which Kantian idealism begins. Utopia, in this sense, originates as if at a distance from the real, but in such a way that it remains impossible to reach it from within reality; any such transition would have to remain, at best, an infinite approximation. It is therefore pointless to expect utopia - one can only begin from it. This implies a different, non-Spinozan immanence, which this paper characterizes as utopian and discovers in Kant. On this reading, transcendental idealism, as non-realism, suspends the real and starts from a ""non-place,"" refusing to think the emergence of the ideal from any environment or the in-itself. This non-place is reduplicated as an immanent, non-dualist facticity from which the subject of idealism proceeds to think and act. Idealism thus implies a utopian structure (non-relation), operation (suspension), and temporality (futurity-as-facticity), which, taken together, suggest a different way of looking at the continuity between Kant and post-Kantian idealism, as well as a way to think immanence as non-Spinozistic - and even as deconstructing Spinozism - while also avoiding any dualism, including that of the religious-secular binary. © 2017 Gaidar Institute Press.

A characteristic feature of the bicentennial cult of Austen is its active self-reflection: Austen fans themselves are often described in sequels and parodies. The figure of an Asten fan, ""Janeite,"" and his or her ways of interacting with classical texts is the main focus of the article. First, the paper describes the transformation of the Jane Austen cult: from the literary communities of the 19th century, through the consolidation in the literary canon and in the popular culture during the 20th century, and finally, ""austenmania,"" a boom of popularity from the 1990s. Furthermore, specific subgenres of film adaptations and literary sequels devoted to fans of the writer, are analysed. Special attention is also paid to practices of using accessories thematically based on the novels by Jane Austen. Due to their visibility, these practices have helped create a framework of analysing the literary cult of Jane Austen through the figure of her fan in two emotional modes: nostalgia and irony. For an illustration of nostalgia and irony as key factors of ""austenmania,"" the article reviews the film Austenland, a screen adaptation of the sequel and a series based on the original script, Lost in Austen. To conclude, the article proposes to consider the interaction of the contemporary reader with the novels of Austen as a never-ending shared re-creating of the imagined literary world, a critical description and self-description of the fans, and a nostalgic dreaming about an idealized historical period of the early 19th century. © 2017 Gaidar Institute Press.

This prosimetrum, by its content and form, is linked to the School of Chartres. It develops the Christian cosmogony and cosmology in mytho-poetic terms. Both the introduction of poetry into a philosophical treatise and the use of elastic poetical formulas in order to give subjective emotions - fear, hope, hesitation - an appearance of philosophical objectivity led to great discoveries in literature and thought. In this, Bernard Silvestris is no doubt representative of a great literary and philosophical tradition of the twelfth-century Renaissance. The author uses a literary form that was well known in the Middle Ages: it combines prose and poetry and allows him to represent the most current philosophical categories and problems in the most unrestrained and suggestive form available in his time. Even his prose is rhythmicized, its poetic character gives it the necessary degree of polyvalence. He relies on a large number of ancient and medieval authoritative texts, from the Timaeus and hermetic Asclepius to Macrobius, Martianus Capella, and Arabic astrology. He is well-acquainted with the exegetical approaches towards antique classics developed by the Chartres masters, since he, a teacher of grammar, also commented on the Eneide at school.

The author proves that the reason for Tolstoy's decision was his polemic with ""saninstvo"" as one of the most fashionable ethical trends of the first decade of the 1900s. The key component of Sanin's behavior and hedonistic philosophy in Mikhail Ar tsybashev's novel was incest. Maupassant's novella is based on the same plot. On the basis of Tolstoy's nonfictional texts of the 1890s, including the treatise What Is Art? (1898), the article reconstructs the writer's view on the forms and boundaries of the representation of incest in Richard Wagner's operas and in Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy, with which Tolstoy also polemicized and in connection with which he stated the ethical potential of art and its permissiveness. From this perspective, Tolstoy's reaction to Artsybashev's novel, combining the motives of incest and extreme individualism, turns out to be a new phase of the old dispute. Tolstoy included the story ""Sisters"" in the second edition of The Circle of Reading as a response to the philosophy of ""saninstvo."" Thus, Tolstoy's collection of wise thoughts can be considered not only as didactic, but also as a polemical text, and deeply rooted in the ideological context of the 1890s-1900s. © 2017 Anastasia A.

However, that was the end of his success: the translated novel Red Earth was not published was not published nor were any of his later novels. The only venue for his rare shorter essays and occasional prose excerpts was the magazine International Literature. The paper discusses this curious writer's biography from different perspectives. It analyzes at length the critical article by Anna Elistratova, published in Na literaturnom postu and International Literature, juxtaposing the two versions and the text of Heslop's novel to contextualize the writer and his work in the Soviet literary criticism of the time. It explores archival materials-Heslop's correspondence with different people and institutions as well as institutional papers-to discuss the case as personal as well as institutional history, representative of the situation of the 1930s.

Semyonov contends that Imperial Visions relates to recent developments in the field of global history, provides an impor­tant corrective to the view of global historians that empires are primarily political formations, and strengthens the argument of constructivists in the field of global history, such as that of Sebastian Conrad on global history as an approach and the processes of “world making.” The most innovative contribution by Imperial Visions to the growing literature on empires is its systematic development of a constructivist approach to empire through ideas and ideologies of imperial mission and entanglement of imperial and national power claims. The article engages the findings by Kumar with what Semyonov calls the growing consensus on “imperial pragmatism” (which stresses governing and practices in the experience of empire) and tests Ku­mar’s conclusions against the existing historical studies of subjectivity and functioning of universalist visions in the context of imperial diversity and hybridity. Semyonov also finds a serious tension in the book between the constructivist approach to empire through imperial ideologies and visions and the structuralist and essentialist view of the “imperial people.” © 2017, Ab Imperio.

The author argues that the turn toward classicism in education in the early 1870s by the newly appointed minister of public education, Dmitry Tolstoy, reflected the regime’s determination to embrace and promote Russian nationalism while curtailing its democratic potential.

However it will make possible to use concept mapping as a standardized tool. In the current study some possible indicators are suggested based on concept maps of experts (n = 4) and novices (n = 9) in the field of data analysis. Experts and novices constructed their concept maps individually after receiving standardized instructions and brief training. Formal indicators were based on interpreting concept map as a graph. Specifically, indicators such as generality of concepts used, structure coherence, proportions of singular, complex concepts, etc. were expected to be discriminative for different levels of competence. We found that nearly all indicators actually discriminate between experts and novices. In addition, a few qualitative parameters of concept maps were identified (availability of key concepts, existence of erroneous relationships, procedural/conceptual nature of knowledge) which also differed across groups. As a result, concept mapping look potentially helpful for standardized evaluation of competence levels if we use the formal indicators.

To test these hypotheses we employ contract-level data for the whole population of public contracts on road constructions in Russian regions during 2011-2014, and governor's biographical information. The analysis showed that during the first two terms of a new governor in office, the procurement competition increases and then starts to decrease. Such a non-linear effect is especially prominent for governors-outsiders -The ones without pre-existing local ties. At the same time, this effect is not observable for the governors who came from the regional elite. Moreover, previous work experience in the region leads to a higher procurement competition on average. We also showed that restriction of competition for governors-outsiders could not be explained by the increase of contract execution quality: Execution delays the increase linearly and the probability of execution terminating is not decreasing with the increase of the governor's tenure. © 2017 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

The research shows that in the Post-Soviet era the importance of ""vertical"" conflicts to the federal centre confronting Russian republics has significantly decreased, while that of ""horizontal"", i.e. inter-group, confl icts has gradually increased. However, this new situation has not been fully reflected in theory and practice of governance. Th e present article is aimed to fi ll this gap, based on the results of the above-mentioned research, and provides some propositions in order to improve the methodological grounds of national policy. © 2017 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

In the course of the analysis, practice of interaction between state structures and the expert community in the regulatory activities of the state was studied and basic criteria for the need for and adequacy of involving experts in regulatory activities of the state were outlined. Also various scenarios for regulating activities depending on the characteristics of the regulatory functions, some key trends and problems of interaction were determined and described. It turned out that the dialogue between public structures and the expert community is complicated by high costs of contracting and a signifi cant risk of opportunistic behavior of each side. As a result, an expedient decision seems to increase the responsibility of each of the parties for the quality of state decisions taken within the regulatory framework and to ensure wide involvement of representatives of civil society in the development of state regulatory policies. © 2017 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

However, reform had antecedents that pre-dated the war and the ensuing revolution.

Although Koyré‘s affiliation to the phenomenological movement is debatable, his thought owes much to Husserl’s phenomenological method. In his books on St. Anselm and Descartes, Koyré focuses on the idea of God and the idea of the infinite. I trace the influence of Koyré‘s analysis of the infinite in its relation to the finite on the development of the idea of the infinite in Levinas. I also show that Levinassian approach to the idea of God as “the idea of the Infinite in me” goes back to Koyré‘s interpretation of the ontological proof of St. Anselm. Next, I explore the influence of Koyré‘s book on Böhme on the philosophy of Michel Henry. Koyré‘s reading of Böhme makes Böhme essentially a precursor of German idealism describing the Absolute that wishes to manifest itself and distinguishing between the manifestation and what is made manifest in this manifestation. Henry applies this approach to phenomena in general, which leads him to a criticism of intentionality loss of a cosmological dimension. I would like to argue in favour of a more balanced phenomenology that wants to be not only prescriptive but also descriptive and sensitive to a certain scientific dimension. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Anselm; Böhme; Cosmological dimension of human experience; Descartes; History of phenomenological movement; Husserl; Idea of the infinite; Levinas; Michel henry; Ontological argument,,English,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042426904

His most famous description of the Scientific Revolution (the dual characterization) indicates two aspects of the process that led to the emergence of classical physics: “destruction of the Cosmos” and “geometrization of space”. However, Koyré frequently used other expressions for characterization of the period, such as “mathematization of nature” or transition “from the world of more or less to the universe of precision” and “from the closed world to the open universe”. One could expect that Koyré would try to reduce his initial dual characterization to one single formula. I argue here that, on the contrary, the duality of description had a special meaning which permits us to keep in focus the complexity of the intellectual change that occurred during the seventeenth century, when a new science was rising from a new conception of reality and a new world-view was emerging from the new science. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Destruction of the cosmos; Dual characterization; Geometrization of space; Intellectual revolution; Mathematization; Scientific revolution; World-views,,English,Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042418608

Both papers are integrated in institutional theoretical and methodological approach to the scientific analysis of social transformations. We underline the conceptualization of social institute as a system of social actors' interactions. This system provides the sustained setf-perpetuating satisfaction of the most important needs and interests of the actors. We differentiate institute as a social phenomenon, superindividual in its nature, from Institutionalization as a process providing sustainability of social interactions. We give particular attention to the fact that human behavior is based on the Institutionally determined logic thus being shaped by institutional demands, compelled, instead of voluntary, motives, and control. The basic condition of institutes' efficient functioning is their guaranteed ability to enforce desirable behaviors. Taken together, social institutes regulate basic interactions in the most important spheres of life such as exchange and distribution of economic resources as well as power relations thus composing social organization of the society as a whole. The purpose of this paper is to take a more nuanced view of social institutions while highlighting inconsistencies and contradictions in the process of their change. An empirical observation of the transitional institutions' development is presented, ft is argued that these institutions are internally inconsistent and contradictory. Transitional institutions' inconsistencies are manifested, first in oppositions between ""old"" (traditionalistic and paternalistic) and ""new"" (competitive and achievement-oriented) social practices. Second, confrontation between ""positive"" (independence and personal responsibility) and ""negative"" (moral and legal nihilism) social norms underlying these practices is observed. We conclude by suggesting a theoretical model and propositions that will address unanswered questions and should provide a more complete understanding of transformative social institutions and their development. © 2017 Russian Academy of Sciences.

In this study we analyzed the influence of stereotypes about psychologists (""Psychologists are not good at math"") on the attitudes of students-psychologists to a statistics course and the quality of their solutions of mathematical tasks. We have suggested that the actualization of the students’ stereotype threat could worsen their attitudes to the statistics course and reduce the quality of solutions of mathematical tasks. However, this influence depends on the personal resources possessed by students: a person with higher self-efficacy and resilience (hardiness) could be less exposed to negative stereotypes. The study involved 94 psychology students, who had recently started a study of statistics. Members of one experimental group were exposed to a stereotype threat, and the other group was not. We actualized the negative stereotypes of the members of the first group: they were told that according to different studies psychologists solve mathematical problems worse than people of other professions. At the same time we didn’t actualize the stereotype threat for the members of the second group. After that, all participants filled in the questionnaire for measuring self-efficacy, resilience, attitude toward statistics and solved some math tasks. According to the hypothesis, the study results showed that the stereotype threat actually reduces the efficiency of solution of mathematical tasks and worsens the attitudes to statistics.

Yik, J.A. Russell and J.H. Steiger. This methodology allows the assessment of core affect – an elementary emotion state which lies in the core of every emotion and represents an integral unit consisting of two factors which every person feels permanently – valence (pleasure-displeasure) and arousal (activation-deactivation). The adaptation of the test was conducted on a sample of 200 individuals. In order to evaluate the construct validity, regression analysis was performed with the factors of two other tests as dependent variables: C. Izard's Differential Emotion Scale and Self-assessment of the Emotional State by A. Wessman and D. Ricks. Cronbach's alpha for each scale was estimated. Out of 12, the reliability of 11 scales turned out to be either high or very high. The results of multidimensional unfolding have demonstrated that the adapted model fits a circumplex with two main axes, namely “Arousal” and “Pleasure”. Regression analysis, in which dependent variables were the factors of two other instruments and the independent ones were the two dimensions of core affect, showed that “Pleasure” was present in a larger number of emotions than “Arousal”. Nevertheless, “Arousal” was dominant in “Interest” and “Surprise” of the Differential Emotion Scale. The results of the regression analysis are commensurate with the essence of emotions it was conducted for. The results of the psychometric check of the instrument enable the conclusion of high levels of reliability and construct validity. Practical importance of the instrument is comprised by its applicability for the assessment of human's emotional state even when the object of the feeling is not obvious. The instrument is likely to be more accurate in conducting cross-cultural comparisons, as it is less dependent on different emotional concepts across different languages.",Core affect; Emotion; Instrument; Method; Psychological construction theory,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041027521

Researchers keep offering new conceptions of vocation and assessment instruments, but the main challenge today is achieving a uniform understanding of the phenomenon. Research demonstrates that all approaches deal with one basic construct, the nucleus of which is a new dimension which a sense of vocation adds to professional activity and other spheres of life. Problems to be dealt with include the source of vocation, its pro-social direction, the role of religion and others. On one hand, vocation has a positive effect on satisfaction with work and life, smoothes effects of stress and emotional burning-out and helps to choose a career and a way of life. On the other hand, there is a risk of being overexploited by the employer, of having to sadiice other life activities and of regretting missed opportunities if the vocation has not been realized.

The article provides the results of a decomposition of the historical GDP trend in Russia in 2000-2016, and of two long-term forecasts of economic growth, along with the contribution of the individual components.

It assesses the sensitivity of the parameters of the pension system to changing scenarios of the population forecast. It is shown that the scenario with low birth rate, life expectancy and migration leads to the smallest increase in the number of pensioners, but at the same time to the greatest reduction in the number of contributors, which may have negative consequences for the situation on the labor market and economic development in general. On the contrary, the scenario with a high birth rate, high migration and the greatest increase in life expectancy gives the least reduction in the number of contributors, but dramatically increases the number of ""insurance"" pensioners. From the perspective of fiscal sustainability of the pension system, the ""low"" scenario is the best, but even there the number of pensioners begins to exceed the number of contributors already in 2024, and the gap between pension contributory incomes and the expenditures on ""insurance"" pensions increases from 2,4% of GDP in 2017 to 4,6% in 2050. Furthermore, the dynamics of life expectancy in the ""low"" scenario leaves no room for raising the retirement age. On the basis of statistics and population surveys, the article discusses whether there are socio-demographic reasons for raising the retirement age in Russia and concludes that the significance of the ill health is weakening as an argument against this measure. The article also presents the results of pension forecast performed for one of the possible options for raising the retirement age, which show that this measure significantly reduces the negative consequences of aging, even under the assumptions about a possible increase in unemployment and disability. By 2050, the gap between the pension incomes and expenditures is almost equal to the level of 2017 under the ""high"" scenario of the population forecast and still remains 1,3-1,5 times lower for ""medium"" and ""low"" scenarios.",Demographic old-age support ratio; Life expectancy; Old age system support ratio; Pension age; Population ageing; Russian pension system,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040461585

The combination of short periods of working life and economic inactivity, as well as low gender differentiation in the duration of working life, distinguishes Russia from other countries. We found that a significant part of the losses and the lag of Russia from other countries are determined by the high mortality rate in working ages, especially the male population.

The importance of this problem increases with the enlargement of this group in the total population. This article aims to analyze the dynamics and cross-country differences in the labour market situation of older workers in OECD countries, developed and transition. Particular attention is paid to the factors under which older workers' participation in labour market is formed. The methodology of this work is based on institutional analysis of the labour market. The results of the study contribute to the understanding of the participation of certain groups of labour in employment. At the same time, this work is practically oriented, and its results can be used for formulating the population and labour market policy in the Russian Federation. We use the OECD Employment and Labor Market Statistics Database as the main source of statistical information. As results of the study, we state that in the OECD countries, since mid-1990s the older groups has significantly improved their position in the labour market, which is reflected in the growing level of economic activity and employment, lower, in comparison with other age cohorts, unemployment. Thus, the stable trend of the previous three decades was interrupted. At the same time there was a convergence of labour market indicators for male and female older age groups and convergence of official and effective retirement ages, including between gender groups. Improvement of older workers employment is largely determined by their personal characteristics. Improving the health of elderly cohorts and lengthening the active period of life create conditions for longer working career. Structural changes in the branch and occupational composition of the employed also create favorable conditions for retaining and attracting older workers to the labour market. It would be wrong to link the ""successes"" of older workers in the labour market with the expansion of part-time employment - most of them work in full-time workplaces. The current policy of the OECD countries is mainly aimed at ""pushing away"" the employee's retirement age by legislative measures, including rising the retirement age. Still little is being done to create better employment conditions for these groups of labour, including retraining. Increasing the flexibility of the labour market could also contribute to a more active participation of older workers in the economic activity.",Cross-country comparisons; Economic activity; Employment; Labour market; Pension system; Population ageing; Unemployment,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040448777

In reality, however, this tiny issue could play an important role in discussions of how Russia was transformed in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Oddly enough, there is no consensus on the date when Peter ordered his subjects to shave their beards in scholarly literature. The author of this article summarises all the available sources on this subject, both those previously used by historians and those he has uncovered, including documents from Peter's personal chancellery, the Privy Chancellery, the Moscow chancelleries and local authorities, as well as testimonies of contemporaries (Zhelyabuzhskii's diary, the autobiography of Prince Boris Kurakin, the diary of Johann Georg Korb, etc.). The author concludes that, on the one hand, the introduction of beard shaving was apparently conceived by Peter the Great during his Grand Embassy or immediately afterwards. On the other hand, considerable tangential evidence and financial accounts of the Moscow chancelleries confirm that a formal prohibition on wearing beards apparently had not existed before the decree of January 1705. Consequently, the author assumes that beard shaving was gradually introduced in Russia. Peter first planted the idea in the minds of members of the elite through playful shaving spectacles and personalised oral decrees, allowing its diffusion among ever widening circles of people. By the end of 1704, Peter might have concluded that his subjects were prepared for a legislative ban on maintaining a beard. Indeed, by the time Peter's famous 1705 decree was announced in Russian cities, many of his subjects had already parted with their facial hair, and they did so voluntarily. © Akelev E., 2017.",Beard shaving; Cultural reforms; Everyday practices; Peter the Great; Power and society; The Petrine epoch,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040052020

In this paper we give an extension of this result to another class of functions. In particular, we study a class of cost functions for which the corresponding optimal embeddings are not Azéma-Yor. The suggested approach is quite straightforward modulo basic facts of the Monge-Kantorovich mass transportation theory. Loosely speaking, the joint distribution of the running maximum and the terminal value in the Azéma-Yor embedding is concentrated on the graph of a monotone function, and we show that this fact follows from the cyclical monotonicity criterion for solutions to the Monge-Kantorovich problem. © 2017, Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences.

The paper focuses mainly on identifying the influence of a firm’s innovative activity, technological capacity for manufacturing and product market competition on its likelihood of having a training program and on training intensity. Design/methodology/approach: The authors administered a firm-level survey to a sample of 2,000 Russian enterprises. This survey includes questions about on-the-job training and key information about the companies’ activities. Probit and ordered probit estimates are used in the statistical analyses. Findings: The results indicate that an enterprise’s provision of training is determined largely by firm-specific factors, such as its innovative activity, technical and technological state of manufacturing and product market competition. The authors adopt two widely used measures of training: incidence and intensity. Innovative activity and the technical and technological state of manufacturing are decisive factors in explaining a firm’s provision of training, as they have a strictly positive effect on both the incidence and the intensity of training. Product market competition has a positive effect on the incidence of training and a negative effect on the intensity of training. Originality/value: This paper is original because it assumes that the process of deciding whether to implement a training program at an enterprise and the corresponding proportion of employees involved in training is built on the presupposition that the training intensity decision is made in two stages. This paper is the first to present estimates of on-the-job training intensity based on data from Russian enterprises. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Innovative activity; Investment in human capital; On-the-job training; Product market competition; Russian business; Training intensity,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037651133

The depth of Leksin's analysis is remarkable: nearly 1000 relevant publications were reviewed in addition to the authors' personal research contributions in this field. Leksin's approach is based on thefollowing three provisions: (1) civilizations must be understood as real historical phenomena with distinct characteristics and unique life cycles, (2) Russia is a multicivilizational structure (the author himself applies the notions of 'a confederacy of civilizations' and 'a civilization conglomerate'): even though Russian civilization forms the core and plays the role of a binding entity in this conglomerate, other civilizational components are recognized not as subordinates, but as complementary civilizations, regardless of their size and passionarity; (3) Russian civilization is characterised as currently undergoing a major crisis and, perhaps, the most powerful transformation in its history. The book presents the results of a systemic analysis of multiple aspects of Russian civilization, including the national mentality, the demographic and spatial characteristics of the 'Russian world', the state of the Russian language, Russian culture and religiosity. Leksin masterfully examines the possible causes and effects of the currently extremely weak national identity of the Russian people, the paradoxes of their addiction to disparaging self-assessments, and the puzzlingly painful attitudes toward the 'grim' pages of the past (which the author characterizes as 'ethno-masochism'). One of the key sections of the book discusses the conditions which maintain the existence of civilizations and cause their demise. By analysing an impressive set of historical facts Leksin argues that civilizations do not cease simply because they fall prey to stronger opponents. Rather civilizations become victims of their own weaknesses, they retreat from the founding civilizational values and the distinctive features which distinguish them from other civilizations. The current weakness of Russian civilization is the disdain and scepticism of many Russians towards their core civilizational values which took centuries to shape, i.e. their neglect of the Russian language, their indifference to the expansionist attitudes of other civilizations, and the strange sense of shame towards their own national mentality.",Civilizations; Culture; Mentality; National identity; Religion; Russian civilization; Russian language; Variability,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037603089

The federal law which set the more general legislative framework in 1996 did not solve the issue of legalizing existing cemeteries. As a result, the incompleteness and inconsistency of the formal aspect surrounding cemetery businesses left a lot of room for corruption, especially in urban areas, and led to a significant deterioration in services in rural areas. This article highlights the main remaining problems in this regard. It is based on an analysis of local media content (published in 2015). The analyses identify the following difficulties and disfunctions: (1) the absence of the legal registration of cemeteries and allocated land plots; (2) the lack of sufficient land for expanding cemeteries; (3) the lack of finances to maintain cemetery services; (4) the uncertain legal status of specialized services; (5) corruption and contractor opportunism; (6) the generally poor level of services and condition of the infrastructure surrounding cemetery businesses.

Although a lot have been made towards improving global financial stability after the recent crisis, the risks remain high as new threats and challenges emerge, and the global financial system is still unable to respond to them adequately. Having considered the banking regulation innovations from the perspective of financial security and inclusiveness, we come to conclusion that the global financial reforms are being conducted in the right direction, and the system became more secure, however, not yet sufficiently sustainable. The other idea we come up with is that implementation of financial transaction tax as a tool to discourage excessive speculation without impeding other economic activities, which is the argument opponents of the tax appeal to, seems to be socially responsible measure working for financial stability at the same time. Finally, we also assume that steadily increasing nonfinancial sector debt of the leading economies presents a serious challenge to global financial stability and to sustainable growth. Estimates of the threats to the world economy from unprecedented debt at all levels of economic system are largely inadequate. Effective and inclusive measures to reduce it have not been yet developed. Therefore, the issue of increasing indebtedness should be tackled accordingly.

Occupational structure forecasts allow researchers to evaluate the quality of job openings and, consequently, overall future labour market performance. Identification of demand for certain occupations in Europe can facilitate assessment of whether processes occurring in the Russian labour market are consistent with global trends. The paper discusses the methodology of labour force forecasting and basic research approaches to the prediction of occupational structure changes. It emphasizes the dynamics of demand for representatives of certain occupations in Europe by identifying the fastest growing and declining occupations and suggests possible reasons for changing demand. The paper demonstrates that the main occupational trend over the next decade will consist in the increasing importance of professionals, as well as technicians and associate professionals. The increase in demand for health professionals and representatives of occupations providing scientific and technological innovation will be most significant. At the same time, it is expected that demand for elementary occupations will also rise. This process will evolve simultaneously with the decrease in the total number of skilled and semi-skilled blue-collar occupations due to globalization and the reduction of industrial production in developed economies. The ongoing ""mechanization"" of many job functions will not eliminate the need for occupations such as cleaners, labourers, domestic servants or personal workers. The need for these jobs allow employees with low levels of education to enter the labour market rather than depending on the social benefit system. Another tendency for all countries with developed economies will be reduced demand for many white-collar occupations as modern computer technologies and the automation of many routine functions previously performed by office workers becomes more prevalent.",Europe; Forecasting; Job quality; Labour demand; Labour market; Occupational structure; OECD,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037348962

Längle (2003; 2016). Based on phenomenological descriptions and focus groups, we created a set of 93 items. The first study used two online samples (N = 818 and N = 215, respectively). Using hierarchical cluster analysis, expert-rating procedure and confirmatory factor analysis with cross-validation we generated a hierarchically structured set of 36 items grouped into 4 fundamental motivation scales forming a general index of existential fulfilment, each comprised by 3 subscales corresponding to the prerequisites of respective fundamental motivation. The scales demonstrated acceptable reliability: Cronbach's α was in the .79-.88 range for the fundamental motivation scales and .93 for the general existential fulfilment score. In the same study we explored evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of the new TEM by examining its associations with measures of subjective well-being, basic psychological need satisfaction, and self-esteem. TEM showed moderate to strong associations with other measures of positive functioning. The second study using a large online sample (N = 3766) found weak associations of TEM scores with gender and age and moderate positive associations with measures of self-control and systemic reflection. The third study (N = 658) explored the associations of TEM scores with the Big Five and measures of anxiety and depression. Existential fulfilment was positively associated with extraversion and emotional stability and showed incremental validity over the Big Five traits in predicting state anxiety and depression.

Dynamical variables of the model are the variation of ask and bid price relative to equilibrium values and difference between numbers of market agents in a-state and p-state. A particular market agent being in a-state has maximum amount of valuable information about financial asset and has minimum information being in p-state. This model explains the impossibility of existence of an equilibrium state of the market, shows the presence of deterministic chaos in a stock market and fractal financial time series. The results of the nonlinear dynamical analysis and statistical analysis of the empirical financial time series are presented.

Satellite data have inspired the development of “array” DBMS. An array DBMS processes N-dimensional (N-d) arrays utilizing a declarative query style to simplify raster data management and processing. However, raster data are traditionally stored in files, not in databases. Respective command line tools have long been developed to process these files. Most tools are feature-rich and free but optimized for a single machine. The approach of partially delegating in situ raster data processing to such tools has been recently proposed. The approach includes a new formal N-d array data model to abstract from the files and the tools as well as new distributed algorithms based on the model. This paper extends the approach with a new algorithm for the reshaping (tiling) of N-d arrays. The algorithm physically reorganizes the storage layout of N-d arrays to obtain an order of magnitude speedup. The extended approach outperforms SciDB up to 28 × on retrospective Landsat data – one of the most typical and popular kind of satellite imagery.

This type of political and socioeconomic development of states cannot always be characterized as temporary or transitional, in fact it turns out to be extremely stable. This is particularly true of eastern societies which have retained clannish traditions and patron-client relations permeating the entire hierarchy of the civil service. The article uses the examples of two Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, to show that this type of relations breeds corruption, but also fulfils a number of important functions in the social field and in daily life, and is sometimes used by the authorities as the capital of modernization. Similarly, the evolution of the systems of public administration in eastern societies is also far removed from unilinear theories of modernization and the liberal democratic public administration theories associated with them. The authors build a case for adopting a new paradigm of “multiple modernities” and a “convergence approach” to the theory of public administration based on this paradigm. © 2017, Russian Academy of Sciences.

For this reason, the efficiency of IC is crucial for all stakeholders. Evaluating efficiency is difficult, because IC is partly unobservable and its efficiency varies across time. The aim of this study is to suggest a methodology for estimating the dynamic efficiency of a company’s intellectual resources. Design/methodology/approach: The panel data model suggested by Kneip et al. (2012) is used to estimate dynamic efficiency. The main feature of this model is that the unobservable component has a multi-dimensional factor structure. Taking advantage of the ability of this model to control for unobserved complex heterogeneity, the authors use the results in further stochastic frontier analysis. A data set containing information about Russian companies for the period from 2001 to 2010 is used. Findings: In this paper, the dynamic efficiency of Russian companies is estimated. It is shown that, using the traditional efficiency estimate, companies can be overestimated. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation of the suggested methodology is that it is necessary to have a long panel data structure. Practical implications: Taking advantage of time-varying efficiency, one can estimate the efficiency growth rate as a measure of performance, standard deviation as a measure of risk and autocorrelation as a measure of stability. Originality/value: This is the first study to present clear evidence of the time-varying nature of IC efficiency. On the methodological side, the paper presents a fairly simple method capable of estimating various indicators of a company’s efficiency. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Intellectual capital; Performance; Time-varying efficiency,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035085406

However, the usage of genetic algorithms requires considerable time for computing, so the proposed system is implemented in a parallel environment. Testing on real data confirmed that the proposed approach allows to build a decision-making system, the results of which significantly exceed the trading strategies based on indicators of technical analysis and other techniques of machine learning. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Algorithmic trading, trading strategy; Genetic algorithm; Multi-classifier system",Character recognition; Decision making; Electronic trading; Genetic algorithms; Learning systems; Time series analysis; Algorithmic trading; Base classifiers; Decision-making systems; Multiclassifier system; Optimal feature sets; Parallel environment; Technical analysis; Trading strategies; Commerce,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035082751

We use data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey-Higher School of Economics (RLMS-HSE) for 2005. This round of the RLMS-HSE included a question on the presence of limitations on usual activities. The question allows distinguishing the effect of unobservable differences in productivity from the effect of discrimination on the basis of disability status. Parametric and nonparametric methods of decomposition are used to solve a problem of non-comparability of disabled and able-bodied individuals and to control for unobserved differences in productivity. Our findings show that nonparametric methods are more applicable to disability discrimination studies due to ""lack of common support"" problem. The evidence suggests that individuals with poor health face substantial discrimination on the basis of disability status in Russia. The discrimination explains up to 25 percent points of the total gap in employment probabilities. This effect should be interpreted as an upper bound of the discrimination after control for differences in observed and unobserved productivity characteristics. The effect may still include the impact of cash and non-cash disability benefits, self-selection into disability, environmental barriers, and wage discrimination.

Design/methodology/approach: Empirical tests of multifactor asset pricing models were applied to demonstrate that R&D intensity could be considered as a pricing factor and affect investors’ risk premiums on those markets. To discover the reasons behind the asset pricing R&D anomaly, this study investigated the nature of R&D risk further by looking into the interactions of R&D and currency risks. Findings: This study discovered that investors in stock markets of R&D-intensive countries should require a positive equity risk premium. However, the reduction of R&D intensity may increase firms’ risks and firms with higher R&D-intensity are less exposed to currency risks in R&D-intensive economies. Originality/value: Many researchers have investigated the relationship between a firm’s R&D and stock returns. But nearly all of them focus on the US Stock Market and attempt to determine the reasons for R&D’s impact on firms’ risks and market value. Meanwhile, the role of R&D and related risks for investors could be even more prominent for stock markets in R&D-intensive countries. To bridge this gap, this research studied stock returns on exchanges of three developed countries where the ratio of gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) to GDP is among the highest worldwide. In this study, the methodology of asset pricing empirical studies was adopted and it was further developed to analyze the causes of R&D risks. The new methodology was applied to discover relationship between R&D intensity and currency risk exposure. The interesting findings could be used for development of firms’ corporate strategies in those countries and for elaboration of policy decisions. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Asset pricing; Currency risk; R&D anomaly; R&D intensity; R&D-intensive countries; Stock returns,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034589036

One of the key contributors to the ongoing debate is Yan Xuetong, the professor of Tsinghua University. In 2005 he started a research project, which aim was to enrich international relations with non-Western thought and historical experience. He analyzed Chinese classical texts from the Pre-Qin era and evaluated their applicability to the analysis of modern international relations. In 2014 he formulated the theory of moral realism, which combined main assumptions of realism with new concepts derived from the ancient Chinese thought. The main goal of the theory and related research questions is to provide an alternative explanation of China's rise and the future of the world order. In this article, the authors analyse the key concepts of the theory presented in different publications of Yan Xuetong: morality, political strength, power, types of leadership and types of major power. The key concept of the theory is morality, which is borrowed from the ancient Chinese philosophy. Moral behaviour in domestic and international politics increases strength and comprehensive power of a state on the international arena, while moral qualities of the major power shape the world order and determine international stability. The authors examine practical recommendations built upon the moral realism theory that Yan Xuetong gives to the Chinese leadership. From a scientific point of view, the theory is criticized for the lack of clear definitions, for contradictions and biases, but it is valuable because it reflects the thinking of major Chinese intellectuals.",Chinese foreign policy; International relations theory; Moral realism; Yan xuetong,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034583202

In this aç erword on fols. 294r and 294v, one of scribes (deacon Gregory by name) twice asked for a blessing for Ostromir the ""Posadnik,"" who had paid for the creation of this outstanding manuscript. The first blessing requested is the blessing of the Holy Evangelists. Although it is perfectly appropriate for someone who ordered such an expensive Gospel book to ask for blessings from the evangelists, the names of the evangelists were listed in an unusual sequence. The order of names corresponds to the order in which selected fragments of the Gospels (Peri copes) are read in ""aprakos"" Gospels: John, Matthew, Luke, Mark. The second blessing is quite uncommon. Gregory asks the three biblical patriarchs-Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob-to bless Ostromir. The most reliable explanation of this request is the Christian name of Ostromir, which is mentioned in the scribe's note-Joseph. In Old Rus' people considered everyone named Joseph as a bearer of the name of Joseph the All-Comely (Genesis). So Gregory appears to flatter Ostromir implicitly by calling him the all-comely son of Jacob, grandson of Isaac, and great-grandson of Abraham. But to stress the desirable and hoped-for similarity, Deacon Gregory mentions Ostromir-Joseph twice as the first aç er the Great Duke of Kiev, just as the biblical Joseph was named the first after Pharaoh. This shows that in pre-Mongol Rus' there was a thorough knowledge of the texts of the Old Testament and that there was a readiness to include these skills in a complicated intellectual game.",Aprakos Gospel; Christianity in Pre-Mongol Rus'; Her meneutics; Joseph the All-Comely; Note of the scribe; Ostromir Gospels,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034217201

It was done by Wittgenstein in ""Tractatus"", however results of his activity still remain in some way confidential, leaving a scope to various versions in this respect. This paper represents one of the possible approaches to this problem. It consists in the ultimate radicalization of characteristics of the logical structure showing that the facts within only the logical structure cannot be understood and described in comprehensible propositions. Thereby, it is possible to highlight the logical level of language and to show some non-logical meanings and values that contribute to the understanding of the world.

And the very fact of existence of such gaps is compatible with physicalism. I also aim to show that resistance of consciousness's reduction to the physical processes is compatible with the doctrine of physicalism. The well-known argument in the defense of dualism belongs to the philosopher David Chalmers which is often also called ""the zombie-argument"". This argument tries to demonstrate that consciousness is irreducible to the physical facts. Zombie-argument grounds on the two premises: 1) reducibility of physical facts and 2) the possibility of complete physics. The former means that conjunction of all microphysical facts is sufficient for inference of the only one conjunction of macrophysical facts. I will try to show that we can infer from the very same conjunction of microphysical facts to different conjunctions of macrophysical facts even if the whole system would be identical in its own behaviour.

Newman is an outstanding English theologian, writer and philosopher, who had a great influence on the development of the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches in the 19th and 20th centuries. Newman became one of the leaders of the so-called Tractarian Movement. Tractarians offered a radically new understanding of the relation between the Anglican Church and other ecumenical churches. The most famous expression of this rethinking was the branch theory. According to this theory, the Anglican Church is one of the three branches of a single universal Church alongside the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches. According to the Newman's doctrine of via media, Anglican Church represents the middle way between Roman Catholic Church and Protestant Churches. In the ""Lectures on Justification"" published in 1838, Newman applies the doctrine of via media to the set of problems that concern the Christian idea of justification. The lecture ""The Office of Justifying Faith"" is in this sense a very characteristic example of the doctrine of via media. Here Newman demonstrates the difference between the doctrines of the Anglican Church about the relationship between justification and faith and the doctrine of the Protestants about justification by faith only.",Faith; Justification; Newman; Tractarian movement; Via media,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033601771

Our goal was to evaluate the effect of active learning compared to passive way (reading only) and action instructions: to compare two similar tasks. Based on theoretical and empirical work, we expected that self-active deducing a general principle of the solution will improve the transport system. On a sample of university students (n = 201) it was found that self-elimination of the principle, in fact, decreased the frequency of the shift as compared to the comparison and that was the main result of relatively ""passive"" conditions. Qualitative analysis of the protocols showed that the main reason for the failure of the transfer was the aspect of learning tasks. At the moment of the verbal formulation of the principle in relation to any one aspect of learning objectives a fixation of this aspect of memory might occur. This dominant interpretation has hampered access to other aspects of the task, and the transfer depending on the relevant for a specific new task, aspect dominated or not. Hence a significantly higher frequency of transfer in a passive condition: in the absence of the dominant interpretation, access to all aspects of the learning objectives remained open at the time of solving new tasks. The results are consistent with some empirical evidence about the ambivalence of the role of the active working through learning tasks compared with passive study and with cultural-historical theory, which emphasizes the guiding role of the adult in learning.",Complexity of tasks; Extension by analogy; Independent learning,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033236341

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a survey of heads of MNCs’ manufacturing subsidiaries in Russia. Findings: The authors found that the intensity of most inter-unit communication channels depends on the speed and magnitude of the changes experienced by manufacturing subsidiaries in products and production technologies. The assessment of the efficiency of a communication channel with high media richness strongly correlates to the intensity of its use. Practical implications: Subsidiary managers are quickly mastering most easy-to-use channels (i.e. e-mail exchange, talking on the phone, reading corporate magazines) by themselves, but are minimizing their participation in time-consuming activities (i.e. corporate-wide and special conferences, arranging informal meetings with foreign peers) unless they have to manage rapid changes in products and production technologies. Thus, to intensify the voluntary use of inter-unit channels with high media richness, headquarters should instill in subsidiary managers the value of cooperation between manufacturing units. Moreover, the effectiveness of inter-unit channels with high media richness should be properly demonstrated to subsidiary managers to assuage their initial reluctance.

These requirements/limitations require to establish the necessary and sufficient condition for single product and multiproduct models, where the condition provides an opportunity to pay required costs from revenue of the previous reorder interval. The corresponding estimation of the profitability of working capital of such models is given in this article. It can be used when optimising supply chains with the deferred payment of the order, and taking into account the TVM. The EOQ-formula modification for determining optimal parameters of inventory management strategy taking into account the mentioned features is presented in this research. It is also shown that taking the TVM into account for such models refers to the phenomenon of reducing the profitability of working capital. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Economic order quantity; EOQ-models; Inventory management; Multiproduct models; Order payment deferrals; Order payments from revenue; Single product models; Supply chain management; Time value of money; Total costs; TVM,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033219847

Even though corruption plays an important role in Communist regimes, post-colonial dictatorships and authoritarian monarchies, coercion, which is a traditional tool used by authoritarian rulers, remains the basis of these regimes. However, a new type of non-democratic regimes, which we call neo-authoritarian, has emerged since the last quarter of the 20th century. The new regimes are based on a dynamic interplay between coercion and corruption. That interplay allows authoritarian rulers to bring either coercion or corruption to the forefront, depending on the current political situation in the country as well as political, economic and social issues on the political agenda. In this type of regimes, ruling political-economic groups capture the state and the public authority in the country, use all their instruments and resources to achieve their private goals. This paper presents empirical results showing that the Communist regimes, dictatorships and authoritarian monarchies exist in 33 modern non-democratic states, while neo-authoritarian regimes can be found in 19 states. The author shows that high levels of corruption are typical of all of these regimes, especially of dictatorships and neo-authoritarian ones. A relatively lower level of corruption in authoritarian monarchies is explained using Olson's theory of stationary bandit. In particular, the author speculates that the ruling monarchs fight corruption among bureaucrats since they perceive it as stealing their own property that damages the sources of their administrative rent and revenues. At the same time, a high-level political corruption persists. Finally, it is demonstrated that dictatorships are on average more fragile than economically elastic neo-authoritarian regimes, although it might be challenging to differentiate between them. All authoritarian and neo-authoritarian regimes, except for a few monarchies, are non-stable regimes, allowing to hypothesize their coming transformations or collapse.",Authoritarianism; Coercion; Corruption; Fragile state; Neo-authoritarian regime,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032992185

The National Party soon stopped praising the Bolsheviks, but the effect of the Revolution on the nascent Communist Party was important and lasting. South African communists closely watched developments in Soviet Russia and established relations with the Communist International (Comintern) even before the Communist Party of South Africa (CPSA) was born. The Party’s ideology and policy were shaped by the Comintern’s ideas and instructions. In the 1920s and 1930s the struggle around the Comintern-imposed slogan of the independent native republic and the Comintern’s campaigns for ‘bolshevization’ nearly brought the party to its demise. But it survived, and its leadership took the Comintern’s ideals and ideas into the postwar era. The Comintern’s theoretical legacy, particularly its idea of a two-stage (national and socialist) revolution proved long-lasting. This idea became entrenched in the programs of the African National Congress, the party of national liberation and since 1994, the party of government.

The vast experiences and deep investigations in the roots of banking risks and banks' behavior patterns are provided on the basis of thorough analysis in the sphere of the world economic literature. The specificity of credit institution business leads banks to high risk exposure, usually systemic one; the banking crises being good examples. The latest global financial and economic crisis of 2007-2009 showed weak aspects both in banking regulation and monitoring and in banking management itself. Risk transformation and risk management are the key functions of banking management in general. The more precise the risk estimation is, the more adequate decision the bank managers take, the more efficient banking management would be and the less is the possibility of the bank's bankruptcy. The world experience has clearly demonstrated that the leading global banks have been discovering, step by step, an adequate answer to contemporary challenges in risk business environment. A brand-new business model of banking risk management would soon arise with the possible following features: a wise balance between stability, profitability and flexibility; more conservative business operations; clear transparency and simplification in inner structure. In this model the crucial role would be given to risk-managers, whose position within banks would transform from simple tool-makers into valuable and authoritative decision-makers. These trends signify that the world banking is at the edge of new understanding and new implementation of risk culture as a fundamental driver of its business. This lesson should also be learnt by Russian banking organizations.",Banks; Business model; Competition; Market structures; Risk culture; Risk management,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032938230

It was organised as a complex project involving dozens of organizations performing particular tasks under the overall coordination by the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and more than 2,000 experts in various S&T fields. Design/methodology/approach: Its methodology embraced a set of qualitative and quantitative methods and combined technology push and market pool approaches. For seven S&T areas (information and communication technologies, biotechnologies, medicine and health, new materials and nanotechnologies, rational use of nature, transportation and space systems, energy efficiency and energy saving), the following types of results have been obtained: global trends, national challenges and windows of opportunities; new markets and niches; innovation products and services; prospective technologies and R&D fields (50 thematic groups, over 1,000 items for all areas); assessment of the country’s positions vis-à-vis global leaders; recommendations for S&T and innovation policies. Findings: The paper covers prospective drivers of economic growth and relevant implications for anticipatory evidence-based policy; discussions of national challenges and building a common vision of the future among key stakeholders; the role of Foresight in particular as a communication platform that helps integrating stakeholder interests; strengthening existing and developing new capacities to increase national competitiveness; and to move up along existing and emerging global value chains. Originality/value: The Russian S&T Foresight, being deeply integrated in the national policy, can be considered as an exemplar tool for “wiring up” the national innovation system (NIS) of an emerging economy with its specific features and problems facing large-scale challenges. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Foresight; Grand challenges; Russia; Science and technology,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029888439

Design/methodology/approach: Research priorities were identified through consistent integrated expert analysis and evaluation of the subject area, i.e. biomedical research preceding development of medical technologies. Findings: Key global and national trends in the biomedical R&D sector and related areas (medicine and health) were identified. According to the experts, the following markets have the best prospects for Russia: regenerative medicine, biodegradable and other biocompatible materials, diagnostic systems, implants, surgical equipment, targeted delivery systems and non-invasive visualisation systems. Entering these markets requires providing support to R&D in the following areas: promising drug candidates, molecular diagnostics, molecular profiling and mechanisms of human diseases, cell technologies (therapies), new materials (biomimetics and other), bioelectronic, bioimaging and biosensors and human genome databases. Practical implications: Regularly updating research priorities is a necessary prerequisite of successful science and technology development of countries, innovative companies and academic institutions. Allocation of (always limited) financial resources on the basis of such priority-setting exercises’ results is evidence of adherence to scientific planning principles. Combined with monitoring and evaluation tools, priority setting for biomedical R&D must become an integral component of Russia’s innovation policy. Originality/value: This is a first-ever presentation of Russian experience in setting research priorities for the health-related sphere.

As a follow-up to the concept proposed in his book ""Realeconomik"", he notes that what is happening now is far from being accidental. The current tremendous amount of events derive from the factors that have gained strength in the last quarter of the twentieth century. Among them were the following: a) the growth of global inequality in its various manifestations combined with a sense of inability to surmount them; b) the disorganization of the world order that emerged after the World War 2; c) the transformation in the sphere of information and communication technologies that outstrip the development of human consciousness; d) the change in the laws governing the functioning of the world economy. The author critically examines the urge for a political ""U-turn"", which has become a spontaneous response to a severe contemporary issues. He believes that the thoughtful attitude of global and national elites toward the factors he suggested for consideration, the awareness of political leaders of the world of their responsibility for its development can prevent an inaccurate reaction that inevitably will result in the growth of chaos. In the second part of the article, the author provides us with a short, but an in-depth analysis of serious changes in the global ratio of centers of political and economic power. He considers the large-scale changes in the world order, called differently (""change of leadership"", the formation of a ""multipolar"" (polycentric) world, ""new normality"" in international relations, etc.). In his opinion, all the above terms express the same essence, i.e. the back-pedaling to the past models of global equilibrium. His special concern is the increasingly diminishing role of Europe, which loses not only political and economic power, but also value-oriented and sense-oriented guidance, which is fraught with negative implications for the civilization based - in one way or another - on the ideals of European modernity. The author expresses and substantiates doubts about the existence in the modern world of an integral alternative concept that could replace them, and sees the eventual starting point for overcoming the global crisis in a qualitatively new comprehension of the current situation on the basis of European values.","""again policy""; Chronotope; Consciousness of postmodernity; Global inequality; Globalization; Russia; Technology of consciousness; The Fourth industrial revolution; The West; World order",,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029571836

We analyze a unique dataset that contains texts posted by 942, 336 users from a large European city across nine years. We show that the chosen complexity measure is correlated with the academic performance of users: users from high-performing schools produce more complex texts than users from low-performing schools. We also find that complexity of posts increases with age. Finally, we demonstrate that overall language complexity of posts on the social networking site is constantly increasing.

Simultaneously, differences in availability and the practices of use of social network sites (SNS) may be considered as major manifestations of such digital divide. While SNS are in principle highly convenient spaces for public discussion, lack of access or domination by socially insignificant small talk may indicate underdevelopment of the public sphere. At the same time, agenda differences between regions may signal about local problems. In this study we seek to find out whether regional digital divide exists in such a large country as Russia. We start from a theory of uneven modernization of Russia and use the data from its most popular SNS “VK.com” as a proxy for measuring digital inequality. By analyzing user activity data from a sample of 77,000 users and texts from a carefully selected sub-sample of 36,000 users we conclude that regional level explains an extremely small share of variance in the overall variation of behavioral user data. A notable exception is attention to the topics of Islam and Ukraine. However, our data reveal that historically geographical penetration of “VK.com” proceeded from the regions considered the most modernized to those considered the most traditional. This finding supports the theory of uneven modernization, but it also shows that digital inequality is subject to change with time. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Digital inequality; Online user behavior; Russian regions; Social network site use; Topic modeling; VK.com,Behavioral research; Geographical regions; Digital inequalities; Online users; Russian regions; Social Network Sites; Topic Modeling; VK.com; Social networking (online),English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029392926

Political Logic and the Post-Nietzschean Overcoming of Platonism"" (Moscow, 2014). In contrast to the reviewer's opinion, my reasoning behind discussing Plato's legacy was not that I wanted to rehabilitate his name in the history of philosophy. Rather, I aimed to overcome the dogmatism of the two dominant schools in contemporary philosophy, i.e. the continental (""post-Nietzschean"") and the analytical schools. My typological method of approaching the history of philosophy allows us to see the implicit possibilities and the limits of the post-Nietzschean intellectual wave, its obsession with the problem of freedom, and its ignorance of the problem of justice. Unlike the reviewer, I consider the shift in key terminology from the notion of freedom to the notion of difference not as an independent development within poststructuralism, but rather as a part of a global philosophic trend, whereby any exceptional speech of positive freedom is bound to inflate the old vocabulary and give incentives to the emergence of fresh metaphors. My interpretation of Plato's political philosophy is not the same as my argument about the invariant problem of political reality, which is the problem of the mutual untranslatability between the language of anomic freedom and the language of communal justice. As we focus of the latter issue, this problem has become invisible today due to the dominance of the two philosophical schools. This diagnosis of the contemporary situation in philosophy is independent from my historical studies. Limiting the ramifications to Russia, it is safe to say that it would be nonsense for us to await salvation from a direct import of either continental or analytical political theories.

The key step toward implementing this decision was eliminating the autonomy of local political elites, who supported the mayor. The regional authorities replaced popular mayoral elections in the city with the appointment of a city manager in order to assure their political control in the future.

As the theory progresses, its basic assumptions become the subject of further investigation and thus new directions emerge. Microeconomics in general and auction theory in particular too often assume away aftermarket interactions, which are a common feature of real markets and have a powerful impact on strategies and incentives. Lately, however, a body of literature emerged that incorporates the possibility of resale into game-theoretic analysis of auctions. This paper reviews this literature. It highlights the role of bargaining power on the aftermarket as one of the main issues in this literature. It then reports how standard auction formats - first and second price auctions in particular - compare in terms of the seller's revenues they generate. Then, this paper shows generalizations of Myerson's approach to constructing optimal auctions when resale is possible; the discussed models require delicate assumptions. Next, the survey covers more specific issues: different approaches to modelling the aftermarket, decisions to enter the primary auction, effects of disclosing information from the primary auction and the role of speculators.

Therapeutic vocalization is described as a means of self-expression and self-research. The authors concentrate on man-focused variations of therapy (free associative singing, vocal improvisations, authentic singing) which help to release the client's authentic vocalizations and his authentic voice (the voice of the inner self). According to the man-focused approach, the therapist's peisonal sets, such as congruence, unconditional positive acceptance and empathic understanding as essential conditions of positive changes in the client, are realized not only in client-centered therapy, but in any other communication aimed at the client's development. The authors believe that such conditions are realized in authentic vocalizations which are viewed as vocalizations of one's congruent (undistorted) experiences. With the help of a three-part model of congruence of experiences the authors classify potential manifestations of the client's subjective experience, identify the congiuent experience and six types of incongruent experiences. The congruent experience is defined as expressed outwardly and undistorted. According to the author's hypothesis, unauthentic vocalizations express the client's incongraent experiences and can be described as the voice of his personality or the outward self, while authentic vocalizations can be viewed as expressions of his congruent (undistorted) experiences, as the voice of his nature, his inner self.

Telecommunication maturity is the core part of the EGovernment Development Index which is widely used in international comparison. Using information and telecommunication technologies by the authorities and population are becoming important determinants of information inequality because of the difference in the level of regional development. Nowadays this reveals itself in different levels of innovation activity. That is why we examine the regional structure of Russia on costs and results of innovation activity and show that it is significantly heterogeneous. At first glance, it is not obvious, but preliminary kernel density estimation and the advanced parametric decomposition of probability density function makes it clear. We proved the presence of three homogeneous groups of regions, and they substantially intersect. To avoid bias in creating the profiles of the groups it was reasonable to use soft classification rather than the traditional crisp separation. For each group we estimate the communication services consumption per capita and the transmitted information content in bytes. The more developed the regions, the higher their level of informatization, but the difference is not so great when we use the relevant fuzzy classification instead of the crisp one. It helps the adequate estimating of the information divide in society and forming corresponding measures to improve e-government efficiency. © The Authors, 2017.",Decomposition of distribution; Fuzzy approach; Innovation activity; Parametric modelling; Soft classification,Government data processing; Probability density function; Regional planning; Fuzzy approach; Innovation activity; International comparison; Kernel Density Estimation; Parametric decomposition; Parametric modelling; Soft classification; Telecommunication technologies; Telecommunication services,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028460794

Russian competition enforcement is an exception in this regard. During the last ten years the Russian competition authority, the Federal Antirust Service (FAS), made several hundred decisions on the violation of rules prohibiting excessive pricing. The question remains whether Russian enforcement is consistent with international experiences, and which part of enforcement limits a positive welfare effect. To achieve this objective the article explains the targets of excessive price enforcement, the legal standard for excessive pricing, and remedies applied in Russian competition law. The main conclusion is that the selection of targets does not generally contradict the objectives of competition enforcement. There are clear theories of harm specific to two of the main target groups: dominant exporting companies that apply third-price discrimination in the domestic market vis-à-vis export markets, and dominant companies that increase prices after deregulation, in case there is no new entry. Standards for proving price excessiveness represent a questionable part of enforcement, and they often turn out to be weak under judicial review. The application of either lower or higher standards for establishing price excessiveness results in decreasing the deterrence effect. A fear of decreasing deterrence explains the recent shift from ex-post intervention to ex-ante price remedies.",Comparable markets; Competition law; Enforcement; Excessive price; Price-cost margin; Remedies.,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028362365

First, the article examines the speeches delivered by the participants in the 1910 jubilee celebrations and concludes that they could not have provided the basis for the Humboldt myth because they mention Humboldt no more frequently than the names of other prominent scientists, and the brief assessments of his activities are too vague to warrant judgements about his contribution to the development of higher education. Second, the article analyzes the works of German philosophers and educators of the early twentieth century and stresses that the sources of the Humboldt myth go back mainly to works written before 1910, had nothing to do with the centenary of Berlin University and were influenced by Humboldt's note On the Internal and External Organization of the Higher Scientific Institutions in Berlin published in 1903. The article concludes that the traditional view of the origin of the Humboldt myth needs to be re-examined: the myth was born before 1910 and the centenary of Berlin University was only one channel for asserting and spreading it.","Academic community; Berlin University; Higher education; History of universities; Humboldt myth; Jubilee, 1910; Wilhelm von Humboldt",,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027963423

Crisis touched the economy of most European countries but to a different extent. Special focus is given to the perceptions of gender equality of vulnerable groups (female, lesser-educated, one-adult households with children). The data is Eurobarometer 2011. The sample is limited to respondents aged 18-65. According to the results of multilevel regression analysis, those who have suffered from crisis assess lower the current level of gender equality whereas perceptions of gender equality do not differ depending on the effect of crisis upon the country. Women assess gender equality more positively compared to men. Those who live in one-adult households with children have higher perceptions of gender equality compared to those who live in other types of households. The discrepancy between lesser-educated and higher educated is larger in countries that suffered less from crisis. However, when the change in GDP per capita is taken as a measure of crisis the effects for family structure and education are not robust. © 2017, Europa Grande.

The author demonstrates that in the past few decades standards of the stern scientific approach established in 1960s by the new scientific history considerably deteriorated while the subject area has broadened enormously. The attitude of historians towards theoretical models has changed. The requirement for accuracy of scientific statements declined and, as a result, the eclectic merging of different theories, concepts and ideas in the same research has become a common practice. The disciplinary language of contemporary historian has changed significantly as well. These changes might be explained by paradigm shifting and influence of new social sciences: cultural studies, memory studies, urban studies, media studies, cinema studies, digital studies, semiotics and others. To sum up, contemporary historical science reflects the state of social sciences.",Globalization of history; Interdisciplinary alliances; Lexicon; New social sciences; Research areas; Scientization; Sociology; Subjects; Theory,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85023766285

At first, the largest piecewise quasi-stationary segments are detected in the speech signal. Every segment is classified using the maximum aposteriori (MAP) method implemented with the Kullback-Leibler minimum information discrimination principle. The three-way decisions are taken for each segment using the multiple comparisons and asymptotical properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. If the non-commitment option is chosen for any segment, it is divided into small subparts, and the decision-making is sequentially repeated by fusing the classification results for each subpart until accept or reject options are chosen or the size of each subpart becomes relatively low. Thus, each segment is associated with a hierarchy of variable-scale subparts (granules in rough set theory). In the experimental study the proposed procedure is used in speech recognition with Russian language. It was shown that our approach makes it possible to achieve high efficiency even in the presence of high level of noise in the observed utterance. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Granular computing; Kullback-Leibler divergence; Sequential analysis; Signal processing; Speech recognition; Three-way decisions,Computation theory; Granular computing; Rough set theory; Signal processing; Speech; Speech communication; Asymptotical properties; Automatic speech recognition; Classification results; Kullback Leibler divergence; Maximum a posteriori; Piecewise stationaries; Sequential analysis; Three-way decisions; Speech recognition,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022324068

Although most of the literature on emigration intentions focuses on economic motives and social advancement objectives, there is a gap in empirical research on the relationship between civic engagement and emigration intentions of Russians. The current research draws on the data from the all-Russia population survey carried out within the framework of the civil society monitoring in 2014. The analysis of the binary logit model revealed that younger and better educated Russians are more likely to declare emigration intentions. The likelihood increases if a person feels resentful about the situation in one's home country, if he/she believes that the prospects for the country and its economy seem increasingly poor, or if being a Russian citizen evokes a feeling of inadequacy and inferiority. The respondents who think that they can make impact through participation in protest movements are much more likely to declare their intention to emigrate. The analysis provides evidence that citizens declaring their intention to emigrate possess fairly strong capacities for civic engagement. The latter can take many forms such as the commitment to collaborate with other people toward public purposes, participation in the work of NPOs, voicing her or his opinion at public hearings, and ranking the right to information as one of the most important civil rights. These citizens can become engaged actors in the country's social transformations if their civic potential is called upon. Hence, we can make recommendations to advance institutional channels for civic engagement, including the developed territorial public self-government widely supported by municipalities, a broad spectrum of NPO activities, efficient mechanisms of public control and independent evaluation of the quality of services provided by federal and municipal agencies.",Civic engagement; Civil society; Emigration intentions; NPOs,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022057904

Building on the legacy of events that conjoin art, critical theory and counterculture, from Nova Convention to documenta X, the new biennial blends the modalities of protest with a neoliberal politics of creativity. This book examines a strained period for these high art institutions, a period when their politics are brought into question and often boycotted in the context of austerity, crisis and the rise of Occupy cultures. Using the 3rd Athens Biennale and the 7th Berlin Biennale as its main case studies, it looks at how the in-built tensions between the domains of art and politics take shape when spectacular displays attempt to operate as immediate activist sites.

With reference to periodicals published in Vorkuta, Norilsk, and Mirny, the author analyses how the official rhetoric that claimed to improve the well-being of the local population and change the social structure of northern cities contributed to a reflection on urban issues both in the former labour camps and in new industrial cities. The abolition of the gulag and the extensive exploitation of natural resources in the USSR's Extreme North caused more people to migrate to the region in the first half of the 1950s. In official narratives of this period, the cities of the Extreme North became symbolic of the conquest of harsh nature: they were used as proof of the homogeneity of inhabited space and the fact that a Soviet reality could be created in any natural conditions. Mass immigration to these cities (and the outflow of workers from central regions) favoured the free circulation of information and the emergence of strong criticism of the living conditions in the cities in question.",Arctic cities; Extreme North; Khrushchev's thaw; Living conditions; Migration,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022019540

The hypotheses we intended to prove was that the parts of the novel describing war (i.e. those where the battlefield or military units are the primary settings), have statistically lower density of interaction between characters, resulting in lower network density, higher network diameters and lesser average node degrees.

The second one is the emergence in computational semantics during 2013-2016 of great interest in the semantic formalism (more exactly, notation) called Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). This formalism was introduced in 2013 in an ACL publication by a group consisting of ten researchers from UK and USA. This paper shows that much broader prospects for creating semantic languages-intermediaries in comparison with AMR are opened by the theory of K-representations (TKR), developed by V. A. Fomichov. The basic mathematical model of TKR describes the regularities of NL structured meanings. The mathematical essence is that this model introduces a system consisting of ten partial operations on conceptual structures. Initial version of this model was published in 1996 in Informatica (Slovenia). The second version of the model (stated in a monograph released by Springer in 2010) defines a class of formal languages called SK-languages (standard knowledge languages). It is demonstrated that SK-languages allow us to simulate all expressive mechanisms of AMR. The advantages in comparison with AMR are, in particular, the possibilities to construct semantic representations of compound infinitive constructions (expressing goals, commitments, etc), of compound descriptions of notions and sets, and of complex discourses and knowledge pieces. .",Abstract meaning representation; Formal representation of semantic content; Semantic parsing; Theory of k-representations,Computation theory; Formal languages; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Computational semantics; Conceptual structures; Intelligent information; Semantic content; Semantic parsing; Semantic representation; Structured meanings; Theory of k-representations; Semantics,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021812285

The aim of this work is to examine the contribution of several structural shocks to the dynamics of investment in 2003-2016. We want to consider the relationship between investment, GDP, domestic loans to non-financial corporations, the interest rate on these loans, external debt of Russian companies and the nominal exchange rate within the framework of sign restricted SVAR. In this work, four shocks are explored: terms of trade shock, shock of foreign funding (access to global capital markets), monetary policy shock and fiscal policy shock (public investment expenditures). The main results are as follows. External shocks dominate the dynamics of the Russian investment, and this applies not only to the terms of trade shock, but also to the shock of foreign funding availability. The sharp decline in access to it after the introduction of sanctions against Russia in 2014 had great negative impact on investments. In addition, the model estimates the role of monetary policy in 2015 as negative-neutral (thus offering an argument in favor of its easing), but at the same time rather insignificant. On the basis of our results we conclude that operational measures of economic policy are unlikely to crucially change the situation for the better. Removal of economic sanctions against Russia could promote investment, but only in the short-term period. In the long run reforms aimed at ridding the economy of such a high dependence on external factors are necessary.",External shocks; Internal shocks; Investments; Sanctions; Sign restricted structural vector autoregression,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021799896

We refer to the adoption of inflation targeting as a treatment, to the IT countries as a treated group and to the non-IT countries as a control group. There are several potential channels through which inflation targeting can stimulate the inflows of the foreign direct investments: reduction and stabilization of inflation level, enhancing the sustainability of the macroeconomic environment, increasing the transparency of the monetary policy, development of market economy institutions. Based on the panel date of more than 130 developing and developed countries over the period since 1980 to 2014, we directly evaluate the effect of inflation targeting by implementing a variety of propensity score matching methods. We find no evidence that the IT adoption enhances foreign direct investments inflows. Indeed, the average treatment effect is small and insufficient. This result is robust to the alternative definitions of the adoption dates and matching methods. This paper has several important differences from previous works. Firstly, we use a wide control group, which can be result in less biased estimates (we can consider the role of unobserved factors more accurately). Secondly, we consider the period from 1980 to 2014, and evaluates trends associated with the global financial crisis.

To this end, we develop a two-factor general equilibrium model of international trade with variable markups and two countries which differ in relative factor endowments. We show that the more developed country (a country with a higher relative capital endowment) is characterized by higher wages and lower capital price while total individual income is higher in this country than in the less developed one. Deeper asymmetries in relative factor endowment between countries lead to more intensive trade. We also show that opening trade between two countries similar in factor endowments results in welfare gains for consumers in both countries. Contrast to that, opening trade is detrimental for residents of developing country if countries have big enough differences in factors endowments while consumers in developed country still gain from trade. This result arises due to high income inequality between two countries' residents. The additional source of welfare losses in the developing country is the high production cost of imported commodities, which reduces their purchasing power for imported goods. Thus, market equilibrium with free trade is optimal only in the case of identical individual incomes between countries. Additional export regulations in the developing country may reduce differences in purchasing power between countries.

We checked the pairwise orders for different semantic classes (e.g. possessive > colour vs. colour > possessive). Our data confirm the claim (suggested in the experimental studies) that the possessive adjectives should be divided into two classes: 'referential' possessives (e.g. adjectives with suffix -in, Petin 'Peter's') and so called 'generic' possessives (e.g. chicken breast). The latter occupy the position closer to the noun. There is one case of significant hierarchy violation. The referential possessive adjectives occupy the intermediate position between gradable adjectives (namely, after 'colour') and ungradable ones ('nationality' class). Hence, the determiner-like possessives occupy not the left-most position as in languages with articles. These findings serve the additional evidence in favor of theoretical claim that determiner-like adjectives in articleless languages acquire determiner function only in the left-most position, otherwise they function as other adjectives. The corpus data confirm the claim that the change of the adjective structural position induces its semantic type coercion.

Statistical data from the Russian National Corpus show that the frequency of past tense forms (e.g., combinations with the form bylo) is much greater for some predicatives than for others. This difference results both from semantic and formal factors. On the one hand, some predicatives denote evaluation (e.g. ploxo 'bad'). Evaluation can be applied to events that have finished or have never been realized. What is relevant is that the evaluation is made at the moment of speech, and this is why the present tense (= the zero copula verb) is used. On the other hand, it is important that the present tense is unmarked with predicatives, while with verbs, it is marked with special verbal affixes. The unmarked present tense form of a predicative can get the temporal meaning from the embedded verb. Interestingly, this phenomenon is in a sense opposite to the well-known phenomenon of relative tense marking. While the latter presupposes that the tense assignment in the embedded event is anchored to the tense meaning of the main event, the tense value of the construction with evaluation predicatives is assigned by 'agreement' with the embedded verb.",Copula verb; Emotion; Evaluation; Predicatives; Tense; The Russian language,,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021762395

We propose a novel recognition algorithm based on the maximum likelihood method for the joint density of dissimilarities between the observed image and available instances in a training set. This likelihood is estimated using the known asymptotically normally distribution of the Jensen-Shannon divergence between image features, if the latter can be treated as probability density estimates. This asymptotic behavior is in agreement with the well known experimental estimates of the distributions of dissimilarity distances between the high dimensional vectors. The experimental study in unconstrained face recognition for the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) and YTF (YouTube Faces) datasets demonstrated that the proposed approach makes it possible to increase the recognition accuracy by 1-5% when compared with conventional classifiers. © 2017, Institution of Russian Academy of Sciences.

The need for a comprehensive metaphor annotation scheme was demonstrated in the comparative study of four state-of-the art automatic metaphor identification systems (Dunn, 2013c), which showed low agreement on a gold standard. The proposed scheme aims to capture a variety of factors involved in metaphoricty, their cumulative effect, and the gradual nature of metaphoricity. The proposed inventory of metaphoricity factors includes nonbasic meanings (the less concrete, body-related and precise meaning(s) of a word); semantic shifts (additional semantic components of the meaning), newly attested meanings; morphologically motivated metaphoricity; different types of personification (a switch in the semantic class of the argument from animate to inanimate); a switch in the semantic class of the argument between concrete and abstract; the use of a metonymic argument, participation in idiomatic expressions; and direct metaphors - the direct use of a word involved in a cross-domain mapping. We also attempt to represent the dynamic interactions between these factors using graph-like visualization. Personifications and direct metaphors are described in terms of conceptual sources and targets. Secondary metaphoricity is attested for words that participate in extended metaphors. Metaphorically related words can be signaled by different types of cues: graphically, or by specific grammatical constructions, or by lexical cues.

They are also more likely to use a compensation strategy if their children do not attend a kindergarten. Lower-educated parents support their child's reading more actively in the fourth grade.

It evaluates the share of national expenditures spent on education, analyzes loan structures by stage of education, and highlights key measures and instruments. In the context of the global economic slowdown, expected to continue for the long term, the most important objective is to identify new drivers of economic growth as traditional sources are exhausted. One of the main sources of economic growth is human capital, especially with regard to the gradual transition from an industrial economy to a service and knowledge economy. Human capital accumulation is particularly important in developing countries. Most developing countries face insuperable obstacles in building human capital accumulation particularly with regard to education development. The potential contribution of MDBs to human capital accumulation has been underestimated and there is a lack of empirical research on this issue. An evaluation of current experience will help identify opportunities for MDBs to increase their role in education performance, which in turn could have a positive impact on economic growth in developing countries. This article addresses this issue by studying MDBs' financing of education projects in emerging economies. The authors collected a database that includes information on the volume and structure of financing with a breakdown by education stage. It was based on more than 500 projects funded by key MDBs. Sources included loan and grant agreements, project interim reports and project completion reports. The authors calculated an average annual ratio of MDB education financing to public expenditure for each country in the final selection. Results showed that the ratio of average annual MDBs allocations to average government expenditures on education is relatively low - between 1.5% and 4.0% for most countries. The largest share can be seen in relatively small countries, where government expenditures stay at low levels. Large developing countries such as Brazil, India, Indonesia and Mexico are leading in terms of absolute volumes of financing from MDBs. The authors also show that most projects during period researched aimed at reducing inequality, developing infrastructure, improving teacher qualifications and reforming the management of education system.

The author directly connects the recent rise of corporate foresight with MNCs' growing need to fill the gaps in traditional corporate strategic management, which struggles with the challenges of today's global turbulent business-environment (known as VUCA world characterised by unprecedented volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity). From this perspective, corporate foresight is capable of providing a number of viable responses. They include the significant expansion of the horizon of MNCs' long-term future vision, enhanced capabilities of business-environment scanning (identifying not only clearly visible trends but the so-called weak signals as well) and strengthening intra-firm communications over the course of the strategy development process, thus contributing to the implementation capacity of the multinational corporate team. Within the analysis of the actual corporate foresight practices of major multinationals, special attention is paid to the common features of foresight organisation (standard process phases, the typical set of methods used) and peculiarities related mainly to different MNCs' sector-specific environment characteristics, including the complexity and dynamics of change. An attempt is also made to describe the actual impact of corporate foresight activities on the effectiveness of the key functions of MNCs' strategic management. The author draws the conclusion that corporate foresight is becoming a core element of the strategic management architecture of multinational businesses, striving to protect and strengthen its global market positioning in an increasingly turbulent and unpredictable environment. For MNCs' top management, trying to find the right strategic course in a radically changing competitive landscape, this powerful tool is increasingly playing the same role as a GPS navigator for drivers lost in an unfamiliar city.",Corporate foresight; Corporate strategic management; Multinational corporations; Strategic positioning in global markets; Turbulent global environment,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020112196

The main conclusion drawn from the study is that the international sanctions have radically changed the structure of Russia's media in a manner contrary to their intention. The sanctions unwittingly favored the biggest players to the detriment of the smaller, protecting state-aligned media and their financial incomes. In the climate of sanctions, media tycoons close to the Kremlin used their lobbying capacity in parliament to acquire advantages, primarily in terms of advertisement.

The development of the domestic segment of the internet economy - the economy of the Runet - is of particular importance due to the size of the country, the significant socioeconomic heterogeneity and the underdevelopment of the transportation networks in the Russian regions. A study of the phenomenon of the internet economy requires a reliable information base. It is hard to provide an adequate quantitative estimate of the size of the internet economy for the following reasons. First, the existing statistical indicator system was created before the internet and internet businesses were widespread. Secondly, this new segment of economy is much more heterogeneous than traditional sectors and industries and thus difficult to measure.

The model is estimated on the Russian data of 2001-2014 for revealing two-dimensional monetary policy shocks: foreign exchange rate shocks and interest rate shocks. The estimation takes into account structural break in parameters of monetary policy rules happened at the end of 2008. Decomposing key macroeconomic variables on structural shocks allows to conclude that Bank of Russia had used its discretionary monetary power to struggle inflation and Ruble devaluation at the expense of recession deepening in the period of world financial crises of 2008-2009. Analyzing transmission mechanisms for two monetary policy instruments the conclusion was made that discretionary foreign exchange market interventions should be used in a situation of stagflation caused by strong negative balance of payments shocks.,Balance of payments shocks; Discretionary monetary power; DSGE; Foreign exchange market interventions; Inflation stabilization; Monetary policy shocks; Russia; Two monetary policy instruments,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019886786

Conrad is known for his publications on the history of German nationalism and colonialism and on Japanese historiography, as well as for his studies of the emerging field of global history. The interview focused on Conrad’s recent book, which offers an overview of the rapidly evolving field of global history and attempts to avoid equating global history with all-encompassing research. To this end, Conrad explores the specificity of global history as an approach aimed at restoring the context of historical processes. The cognitive or constructivist turn in global history announced by the author allows for meaningful comparisons between the logic of this field’s evolution and the development of New Imperial History. Conrad discusses the intellectual genealogy of the book, the problem of supplementing his “constructivist” orientation with a focus on structures, and he answers questions about the problem of historical subjectivity as perceived by different currents within global history. He also reflects on the first responses to the book by colleagues from different countries. © 2017, Ab Imperio. All rights reserved.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019880322

The task is to subdivide efficiently the city into n districts Di, and open a centre at the geometric median m (Di) of each district. We assume that the density of the population p in the city is constant ρ =1. If each inhabitant of district Di living at point x follows the prescriptions of the government and visits the centre m(Di), his profit is λi/area(Di) - d(x,m(Di)), where area(Di) - is the area of Di, that coincides with its population, and λi is a positive weight representing the utility of the centre. We show that the government can subdivide the city into a prescribed number of districts so that the optimal strategy of each inhabitant is to visit the centre of his own district. Such a subdivision is called balanced. It turns out that the borders shared by neighbouring districts of a balanced subdivision are pieces of hyperbolae. In order to find a balanced partition we use the potential techniques. Namely, we introduce a functional on all length n partitions that attains it minimum on a balanced partition. The proof of existence of the minimum is quite involved and is attained by a reduction of the continuous problem to a discreet one. The continuous domain is replaced by a discreet subset formed by an ϵ -net and the continuous functional is replaced by a functional defined on partitions of the discreet set. To get back to the continuous case one takes the limit ϵ → 0. In the process of the proof we investigate properties of the geometric median of finite subset Sϵ contained in the unit disk.

Design/methodology/approach: Analysis takes into account the underwriting process and the choice of contract terms of all loans originated from 2008 to 2012. The data set contains demographic and financial characteristics for all applications, loan terms and the performance information for all issued loans by one regional bank which operates government mortgage programs. The paper uses a multistep semiparametric approach to estimate the determinants of bank and borrower choice controlling for possible heterogeneity of preferences, sample selection and endogeneity of contract terms. Findings: The study found that the demand of low-income households who are unable to afford to improve the housing conditions by other instruments than government mortgage is less elastic according to the change both in interest rate and maturity compared with higher-income households. Social implications: Given lower elasticities of the demand, the low-income group of borrowers has higher potential cost of loan and is usually rejected by commercial banks. The presence of the Agency of Housing Mortgage Lending special programs with subsidized interest rate for special constrained categories (young families, teachers, researchers etc.) widens the access for housing conditions’ improvements as a part of housing affordability government program.

Discourse theory, informed by critical discourse analysis, is deployed to analyze these discursive constructions. The analysis shows that Greece's economic/social/political problems are constructed as symptoms that underline Greece's fundamental deficit, which is the country's alleged 'lack of 'Enlightenment', as perceived by 'liberal' voices in Greece and elsewhere. The article concludes that such discourses are part of a biopolitical, disciplinary framework producing the object to be reformed by austerity: an 'un-Enlightened' 'Greek character', 'guilty' for 'self-inflicting' Greece's crisis. This 'reform of character' envisioned by liberals in Greece and elsewhere, is supposed to emerge through the institutional advance of neoliberal restructuring processes that include austerity reforms, privatizations, and loss of labor and civic rights, conditions to foster the neoliberal, entrepreneurial, mobile and austere subject, to potentially meet the socio-political requirements of late capitalist growth. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.",Biopolitics; Crisis; Enlightenment; Europe; Greece; Liberals; Modernity,,English,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019124904

This examination focuses on administrative social workers; a particular group of largely office-bound social workers within the profession whose central job is to help people process the required documents needed to receive social assistance and benefits. Firstly, the article offers an overview of existing research on the sociology of emotions and professions, with a special focus on those studies exploring emotion management. The conclusion emerging from this review is that analysing emotion work in the field of social care can lead to a deeper and more complete understanding of its specific character and the ethical rules operating within it. Secondly, an analysis of administrative social worker interview transcripts was conducted as part of a larger research project on the professional culture of this occupation. This analysis was completed with help of NVivo software and reveals that although interviewees are not only clearly aware of emotion work, they do all the same try to reduce emotional expenditure in their communication with clients and strive to standardise how they work with their emotions. Carrying out emotion work has a key function in supporting professional identity among administrative social workers and furthering the development of a professional culture. On the other hand, the emotional expenditures involved and the challenge of 'making the profession worth it' are alleviated by the sense that one's work fulfils an important 'moral mission' in providing social care and assistance. © 2017 The Journal of Social Policy Studies.",Administrative social workers; Emotion work; Emotional culture; Professional culture; Professional emotional ideology,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019048748

There are a number of social and professional reasons behind the need to verify the work of civil servants. Among the key Social reasons include the importance of understanding the structure and essence of civil servant activity in society, which can act as a factor of social interaction and build confidence within this social group. Professional reasons revolve around the need to re-legitimatize the bureaucratic professions in the social state, which is achieved by launching a raft of new principles, norms and understanding of professionalism. The study is based on a representative survey of civil servants (n = 401) and municipal officials (n = 333) in St. Petersburg. The unique methodology, which helps to formulate competency models for civil servants, was developed and tried out. This methodology includes an action analysis of competences that was derived from the educational standards of Masters of Public Administration. These standards were transformed into descriptors of civil servant activities and helped create a survey of Saint-Petersburg civil servants analyses with the use of SPSS analysis. As a result, we identified which knowledge and skills are vital to currently employed civil servants and highlighted those deemed to be unimportant in their daily activities. We found there were significant correlations between skills and job positions, age and sex. We also constructed competency profiles for different levels of government, which included ranking 54 kinds of professional activities. The analysis reached the following conclusions. Firstly, the nature of a civil servant's professional activity is not only determined by their competence; one's the position in the vertical of power is also vital. Secondly, the request for specific professional competence of the civil servants on the federal, regional and municipal levels should precede detailed analysis of competency profiles of the officials of various levels of government, as well as those meanings and preferences that invest themselves state and municipal officials in their routine professional practice. The building of competency among civil servants reflects contradictions between achieving the routinization of professional activity and the need to improve the professionalism of officials considering the global trends. © 2017 The Journal of Social Policy Studies.",Activity approach in social sciences; Bureaucracy; Competence; Professionalism,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019048620

Design/methodology/approach: The authors consider 78 Russian regions for the period from 2008 to 2012. Data were collected from the Federal State Statistics Service of Russia. The authors investigate differences in the volume and structure of consuming absolute alcohol in aggregate, vodka, beer, and wine. Estimating fixed effect panel models enables us to reveal the relationship between alcohol consumption and the set of macroeconomic factors that include economic development of regions and living standards, the effect of unemployment, and the degree of urbanization. Findings: Alcohol consumption is procyclical in Russia. Two main alcoholic beverages in Russia are vodka and beer. Economic development and urbanization of regions are positively related to consuming alcohol. Unemployment rate affects consumption of different types of alcoholic drinks in a different way. For absolute alcohol, vodka and beer, this relationship is negative. However, it is positive for wine. The effect of unemployment on absolute alcohol and vodka increases over time. For beer, it is remained unchanged. For wine, this effect weakens over time. Originality/value: To the authors knowledge, the paper is the first one to analyze macro-level factors of consumption of different alcoholic beverages in Russia. Conclusions made on aggregate macroeconomic data add to understanding of drinking patterns in Russia as a country with the large territory and great regional variations.

The analysis leads to a discussion on the present state of the Russian agroindustry and possible future strategies for adaptation in the context of the rapidly changing global environment. Design/methodology/approach: The design of this study is based on the application of the core methods of Foresight. First, a trend analysis is undertaken using reviews and expert methods. Trends identified are mapped using a social, technological, economic, environmental, political and value (STEEPV) framework to ensure that a broad range of trends are covered, which may be stemming from various factors affecting the agriculture sector. The analysis of the big picture of global trends and challenges, interacting with country-specific structural factors, translates are translated into the opportunities and threats, which will in turn help to develop possible strategies for adaptation. Findings: This study develops two adaptive strategies for the development of the Russian agroindustry that are feasible in different short- and long–term time horizons. The first strategy is considered to be the most likely choice for the period before 2020. It includes radical imports’ substitution (of commodities as well as machinery and high-tech components) for ensuring national food security with inevitable temporary setbacks in efficiency and labour productivity. The second strategy, which becomes feasible after 2020, considers re-integrating Russia into global supply chains and expanding commodities exports (volumes and nomenclature) based on full-scale technological modernization with the use of international capital. Research limitations/implications: The study design is based on the assumption that Russia’s position as a country, which is highly self-sufficient on basic agricultural products and large exporter of crop commodities and fertilizers, will remain unchanged in the horizon of at least 20 years. However, long-term forecasts should also scrutinize the possibility of radical structural changes. Therefore, future research should concentrate on wild cards that can completely disrupt and transform the Russian agriculture industry and as well as the whole economy. Practical implications: This paper suggests a number of recommendations on national science and technology policy for the three main industries of the Russian agricultural sector: crop husbandry, animal breeding and food processing (the fisheries sector is excluded from the scope of this paper). In addition, this paper proposes a number of measures towards alleviating the institutional barriers to raise the investment attractiveness of the sector. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper lies in the originality of the research topic and methodology. The Russian agricultural sector has rarely been studied in the context of global agricultural challenges and threats taken on the highest level of aggregation beyond commodity market analysis or agro-climatic and logistics factors.

Design/methodology/approach: Having reviewed existing global energy forecasts made by reputable multilateral and national government agencies, major energy corporations and specialised consulting firms, the authors noticed that most of them are by and large based on the extrapolation of conventional long-term trends depicting gradual growth of fossil fuels’ demand and catching-up supply. Unlike this approach, the paper focuses on the possible cases when conventional trends are broken, supply–demand imbalances become huge and the situation in the global energy markets is rapidly and dramatically changing with severe consequences for the Russian economy, seriously dependent on fossil fuels exports. Revealing these stress scenarios and major drivers leading to their realisation are in the focus of the research. Based on the Social, Technological, Economic, Environmental, Political, Values (analytical framework) (STEEPV) approach, the authors start from analysing various combinations of factors capable to launch stress scenarios for the Russian economy. Formulating concrete stress scenarios and assessing their negative impact on the Russian economy constitute the next step of the analysis. In conclusion, the paper underlines the urgency to integrate stress analysis related to global energy trends into the Russian national systems of technology foresight and strategic planning, which are now in the early stages of development. Findings: The analysis of global energy market trends and various combinations of related economic, political, technological and ecological factors allowed to formulate four stress scenarios particularly painful for the Russian economy. They include the currently developing scenario “Collapse of oil prices”, and three potential ones: “Gas abundance”, “Radical de-carbonisation” and “Hydrogen economy”. One of the most important conclusions of the paper is that technology-related drivers are playing the leading role in stress scenario realisation, but it is usually a specific combination of other drivers (interlacing with technology-related factors) that could trigger the launch a particular scenario. Research limitations/implications: This study’s approach is based on the assumption that Russia’s dependence on hydrocarbons exports as one of the main structural characteristics of the Russian economy will remain intact. However, for the long-term perspective, this assumption might not hold true. So, new research will be needed to review the stress scenarios within the context of radical diversification of the Russian economy. Practical implications: This paper suggests a number of practical steps aimed at introducing stress analysis as one of the key functions within the energy-related sectoral components of the Russian national systems of technology forecasting and strategic planning. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper is determined both by the subject of the analysis and approach taken to reveal it. In contrast to most of research in this area, the main focus has been moved from the opportunities and potential benefits of contemporary technology-related global energy shifts to their possible negative impact on the national economy. Another important original feature of the approach is that existing global energy forecasts are used only as a background for core analysis centred around the cases when conventional energy trends are broken. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Energy; Energy market forecasting; Global energy trends; Scenario; Stress scenarios; Technological shifts,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018777290

This paper aims to present the results of research into the evolution of Russia’s S&T priorities in information and communication technologies (ICTs) based on a system founded on detailed profiles for sectoral critical technologies (CTs) supplemented by quantitative statistics on the development of the information society in Russia. Design/methodology/approach: This analysis of Russia’s ICT S&T priorities was broken down into three periods which tie in with milestones when large-scale changes in ICT were observed: 2002-2006; 2007-2010; 2011-2015. Findings: This paper presents the results of research into the evolution of Russia’s S&T priorities in ICTs based on a system founded on detailed and carefully studied profiles for sectoral CTs supplemented by quantitative statistics on the development of the information society in Russia. An important aspect in support of this approach is regular large-scale processes to update the profiles of sectoral CTs (on average once every five years) and to conduct statistical observations in ICT (once every year). The involvement in this process of updating CTs of large (500 or more) numbers of sectoral experts representing industry leaders, research and educational institutions, core ministries and regulatory bodies guarantees a comprehensive cross-section in researching and profiling CTs in different important areas: science, production and government administration. Originality/value: For more than 15 years, the Higher School of Economics has been conducting a range of statistical studies on ICT: the amount of goods and services output in the ICT sector and the level of diffusion and use of ICT in the economy, social sphere and public and private life.

Design/methodology/approach: Hypotheses’ testing was carried out by a series of calculations comparing the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of cluster initiatives; the number of new cluster initiatives to the number of neighbouring regions, where cluster initiatives had begun to develop earlier; and ranks of regions within the Russian regional innovation scoreboard to the quantity and quality characteristics of cluster initiatives therein. Findings: The results of the study empirically confirm that the national cluster policy significantly influenced the emergence and advancement of cluster initiatives in Russia. The proximity to the regions, having previously launched cluster support programmes, also had an impact on the emergence of new cluster initiatives. The cluster initiatives’ age had an ambiguous effect on their performance. Finally, the level of regional innovative capacity was correlated only with the number of cluster initiatives localised therein. Practical implications: The findings show that along with the direct effects of the national cluster policy for the government-supported clusters, there are positive externalities, e.g. the emergence of new cluster initiatives throughout the country.

The authors attribute particular attention to implication for Russia, which is relatively better positioned regarding the availability of water resources. However, the country still faces challenges related to the protection of water resources, drinking water supply, water networks, consumption patterns, water discharge, treatment and re-use. The present study aims at identification and analysis of trends, factors and uncertainties in water supply, demand, use and re-use with a particular focus on sustainability of water systems; water use by households and industry; and new water services and products. Design/methodology/approach: Research methodology in this paper involves a horizon scanning exercise for the identification of the key trends, factors and uncertainties along with the identification of weak signals of future emerging trends and wild cards in the form of future surprises, shocks and other unexpected events that may disrupt the preservation of water resources and the future of the water sector. Trends characterize broad parameters for shifts in attitudes, climate, policies and business focus over periods of several years that usually have global reach. These are usually experienced by everyone and often in similar contexts. Trends may represent threats, opportunities or a mixture of them, identified through underlying processes, possible events and other future developments. Findings: A key systemic restriction of water use for the next decades both globally and in Russia relates to competition between agriculture, energy, manufacturing and household water use. Given that the amount of renewable water resources is almost fixed and even decreases because of pollution, circular economy solutions for water use will be required. Implications of the global trends identified in the study for Russia are dependent on the overall situation with water resources in the country. Russia has sufficient water supply: the overall intake of water for drinking and economic purposes in Russia amounts to 3 per cent of the total water resources, two-thirds of which are discarded back to water bodies. At the same time, there are substantial problems associated with the extremely uneven distribution of water resources across the country, as well as high “water intensity” of the Russian GDP. The Russian water sector is currently not very attractive for investors. Moreover, it has significantly less lobbying opportunities than other infrastructure sectors, and this complicates its institutional and financial positions. Meanwhile, there have been some positive changes with regard to activities with a short pay-off period. Originality/value: The paper offers one of the first studies on the future of Russian water resources with a focus on the water supply and sanitation sector. A comprehensive approach to trends identification (not found in other studies on Russian water resources) allowed authors to identify social, technological, environmental, economic, policy and value-related global trends and uncertainties. Moreover, implications of these trends and uncertainties, as well as Russia-specific trends, were outlined. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Horizon scanning; Russia; Sustainable water systems; Water goods and services; Water resources; Water use,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018730520

Academic staffof universities consists of highly qualified specialists, whose characteristics are believed to include open-mindedness.

Some researchers divide university teachers into two groups based on the fundamental self-identification parameters: (i) those identifying themselves with the organization, and (ii) those committed to the profession. It is generally believed that teachers committed to the profession are more likely to support innovation. The article argues that both types of self-identification may be a factor of either active promotion of innovations or resistance to them. Resistance to innovation may be caused not so much by faculty characteristics as by the scale and pace of change. Permanent large-scale changes destroy the environment required for professional activities, forcing the academic staffto choose between organizational and professional identity and exciting resistance to innovation in them. The innovation process confronts the university with a crucial problem of retaining professionals, since they first of all identify themselves with the professional community.

The main strengths of the approach are 1) possibility of falsification tests, 2) rigor of analytical procedure, based on Bayesian logic and related empirical tests, 3) getting the most of in-depth knowledge of the case, 4) compatibility with quantitative research as the auxiliary method. Apart from that, process tracing serves as a powerful remedy against a-theoretical narratives and turns the case study into a genuinely captivating detective storyline. Among the weak points one should mention 1) lack of parsimonial explanations, 2) lack of generalizability, 3) time-consuming process of data collection. To demonstrate how process tracing can be used in real-world research the article provides one example based on study by Ahmed which devoted to electoral reforms in Europe at the end of the 19th century. It is shown how Ahmed based on process tracing falsified the influential theory by Rokkan-Boix and put forward the solid argument for her model of explaining the logic of electoral system reforms in Europe at the time of the franchise expanded.",Bayesian logic; Case study; Causal mechanism; Electoral reform; Political methodology; Process tracing; Qualitative analysis,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016278997

Addressing this problem, we elaborate a comprehension of Russian sociology as a continuing and integrative tradition of social thought development, unified by a set of underlying common features: (1) publicism; (2) moral and ethical concern; (3) problem orientation. Contemporary Russian sociologists often tend to see these characteristics as obstacles to integration process in international arenas with their more rigorous methodological standards and more independent academic sphere. However, literature analysis demonstrates that attempts to make sociology an as ""hard"" science as possible, become increasingly questionable. The outlined three features are particularly important, for seeing the opportunities of Russian scholars to make valuable contribution to the global sociology in its response to the issues discussed by the foreign autors.",History of sociology; International sociology; Methodology in sociology; Public sociology; Russian sociology,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015936907

We systematize the literature on the subject and draw conclusions on a number of fundamental premises of the theory. Thus, the circumstances under which this effect takes place must meet the following criteria: relevance to society as a whole, the international level, suddenness of the event, the direct participation of the President in solving the problem and the existence of personified ""other"". The emergence of rally effect is closely connected with characteristics of media coverage of the issues and patriotism of the population. The article also notes that, despite the considerable scale that this effect can reach (up to 35% of approval rating), the duration of its preservation is not so large (up to six months).

Counterfeit alcohol is defined here as the manufacture, distribution, unauthorized placement (forgery) of protected commodity trademarks, and infringement of the exclusive rights of the registered trademark holders of alcoholic beverages. It is often argued that the expansion of the counterfeit product market is due to the steady demand of economically disadvantaged people for low-priced goods. The situation becomes more complicated once deceptive and nondeceptive forms of counterfeiting are taken into account. This study aimed to identify markers of risky behavior associated with the purchase of counterfeit alcohol in Russia. Methods: The analysis relied on consumer self-reports of alcohol use and purchase collected nationwide by the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS-HSE) in 2012 to 2014. I used a generalized linear mixed-model logistic regression to identify predictors of risky behavior by consumers who purchased counterfeit alcohol, either knowingly or unknowingly, during the 30 days preceding the survey. Results: Purchases of counterfeit alcohol declined slightly from 2012 to 2014, mainly due to a decrease in consumers mistakenly purchasing counterfeit products. Predictors of counterfeit alcohol purchases differed between consumers who knowingly and unknowingly purchased counterfeit products. Nondeceptive purchase of counterfeit alcohol was related primarily to an indifference to alcohol brands. Consumers with social networks that include drinkers of nonbeverage alcohol and producers of homemade alcohol were highly likely to consume counterfeit alcohol deliberately. Problem drinking was significantly associated with a higher risk of both deceptive and nondeceptive purchases of counterfeit alcohol. Poverty largely contributed to nondeceptive counterfeiting. Conclusions: The literature has overestimated the impact of low prices on counterfeit alcohol consumption. Problem drinking and membership in social networks of consumers of surrogate alcohol (i.e., nonbeverage) are more influential in explaining why people purchase counterfeit alcohol. Further research on these 2 factors is needed to more fully understand the purchase and consumption of counterfeit alcoholic beverages.

The various names given to the sum of money the protagonist, Polikei, loses can be explained by the ruble’s “dual exchange rate”; that is, the differential rates between the silver ruble and assignation ruble (1:3.5) which existed in Russia from 1839 to 1851. Polikei’s misplacement of banknotes (called “devilish” in “Polikushka” drafts) accords with the broader European literary mythology of banknotes as the Devil’s playthings. In addition to European parallels, the article discusses possible Russian plot sources dating back to Nekrasov’s poetry and the prose of Pogodin, Potekhin, and Dostoevsky. In the second section, the article explores the narrative patterns of the story and demonstrates that we cannot blame Polikei’s death on his mistress’ desire to test and rehabilitate him. The narration is organized as a network of mutually exclusive viewpoints, the correlation of which develops into an ugly portrayal of both the elderly landlady and Polikei, shown to be equally guilty in the tragic ending of the story. In the last two sections, the article reveals the ideological underpinnings of Tolstoy’s skeptical attitude, displayed in his pedagogical writings of 1861–62, toward the notion of peasants and the educated elite being able to communicate with each other effectively.

However, there is a lack of researches on students’ experience during learning with mind maps. Nowadays, information technologies are developed and wide spread impetuously. Thus digital mind maps become more and more popular. The process of their creation is strongly supported by different software, but little is known about this software application to educational needs. This paper aims to fill this gap. The comprehension of mind mapping approach adoption is implemented in a form of pedagogical reflection. The data for the pedagogical reflection were gained from the research, which was designed in a mixed methodology. The combination of a survey and a participant observation aimed to get collaborative data on students’ perception and estimations of mind mapping. The survey’s questionnaire was developed based on the technique’s functions and results of participant observation. The analysis highlighted that the Coggle may be confidently use as an educational software in case of supporting in-class and home collaborative activities on mind mapping. As a result, the set of recommendations for teaching with mind maps was developed. The directions for a further work are discussed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Collaborative learning; Computer-supported collaborative learning; Digital mind maps; Mind mapping; Mind mapping software,Application programs; Computer software; Education; Mapping; Schematic diagrams; Students; Surveys; Teaching; Collaborative activities; Collaborative learning; Computer Supported Collaborative Learning; Educational software; Mind maps; Mind-mapping; Participant observations; Software applications; E-learning,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010705142

His practice of ≪defining ≫ a thing with the number of pebbles needed to draw its silhouette is usually regarded as a naive or unworthy version of the number philosophy of his teacher, Philolaus of Croton. Our approach focuses on the concept of the limit, or the boundary (?ρος), used by Aristotle to explain Eurytus' practice, which we analyse in the context of Aristotle's testimonies distinguishing Early Pythagoreanism from its interpretations in the Early Academy. We strive to show that the idea underlying Eurytus' performances deserves more appreciation in the context of Presocratic philosophy, and to lay a basis for an alternative approach to the interpretation of this practice. © Nikola D.

However, few researchers have considered the costs of procurement regulation for public customers and private suppliers. This problem is especially acute for the public procurement system in Russia. In this paper we propose an approach to measuring public customers' procurement costs. We test this approach with the data on a large Russian public customer: Voronezh State University. We show that the proposed approach is universal and can be applied at a micro level by other public customers to measure the efficiency of their procurement and to optimise the costs. This approach can also be used as a basis for a larger inquiry into the costs and effectiveness of procurement at the level of regional authorities or sectoral ministries.

This paper extends tax theory by modeling information reporting as an additional enforcement instrument that allows a tax authority to acquire signals about taxpayers' income. The paper rigorously characterizes the optimal strategy to maximize tax revenue when enforcement resources are limited. It determines the optimal allocation of resources between audits and information reporting, which is governed by how effectively the signals facilitate audit targeting. The model demonstrates that the value of information reporting declines with audit coverage because of the corresponding decline in the value of audit targeting. The optimal level of information reporting is an inverse U-shaped function of the budget allocated to enforcement, while the optimal audit coverage always increases with the budget. This finding implies that at some point it may not be optimal to expand information reporting. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Information reporting; Optimal enforcement; Tax audit,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85000716601

A conventional theoretical rationale for the presence of an outside blockholder is mitigation of the agency problem via monitoring. Our model provides a novel insight: outside blockholders may be attracted by entrepreneurs with low, rather than high, agency problems in order to signal their low propensity to extract private benefits. Our result yields a new interpretation of an often documented positive relationship between outside ownership concentration in a firm and its market valuation: it may be driven by “sorting” rather than by the direct effect of monitoring. We show that the positive correlation may arise even if the blockholder derives private benefits and has no positive impact on the value of small shares.

The estimation of short-term wealth effects at 21 days around the sell off announcement for five BRICS markets and 1247 events shows positive reaction with cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) of 1,2 % for two-day announcement windows (−1;0) and of 1,28% for five-day announcement windows (-3; 1). The method of calculation the normal daily return does not change the testing results. The analysis of completed sell off transactions with a deal value more than US$ 5 million demonstrates that overleverage can be considered as a significant motive for break-ups decisions. The financial and focused hypotheses can not be rejected for BRICS firms. The logit model identifies the divestitures factors for 780 BRICS firms on the period 2000-2016.

We consider a wide range of indicators of the quality of institutional environment: the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom, the Worldwide governance indicators, the World Economic Forum’s indicators of corporate culture, development and regulation of financial markets. Unlike most previous studies, we test not only static regression models (multifactor linear regressions), but also dynamic models based on the generalized method of moments, which allows to solve the problem of endogeneity of variables. The results show that low quality of institutional environment, macroeconomic and financial instability stimulate growth of the share of LCY corporate bonds in the total issuance volume. In the periods of instability LCY corporate bonds become less attractive for foreign investors, and issuers are forced to raise capital in the domestic market. The most significant factors in both static and dynamic model specifications are the World Bank’s indicators of regulatory quality and rule of law. A decline in sovereign credit ratings also gives impetus to the development of LCY corporate bond markets. An original result is that more developed stock markets suppress the growth of LCY corporate bond markets: equity and corporate bonds are competing financing sources for companies from developing countries. A developed banking sector contributes to the growth of the LCY corporate bond market: banks act as dealers and market makers. Devaluation of the national currency has a significant positive influence on the explained variable. © 2017 International Business Information Management Association IBIMA.

The loss function that determines M-estimates was supposed to be convex and twice differentiable. The threshold of the autoregressive model was considered to be known and unique. We proved the asymptotic normality of M-estimates of autoregressive equation parameters. Moreover, we found the asymptotic relative efficiency of M-estimates, the least square and least absolute deviation estimates with respect to each other. First, we calculated the asymptotic relative efficiency values for the normal distribution, as well as the values of the double exponential distribution (Laplace distribution) and contaminated normal distribution (Tukey distribution). Then, we described the dependence of the asymptotic relative efficiency of these estimates on Tukey distribution parameters (the proportion and level of contamination). Next, for all three estimates in the space of Tukey distribution parameters, we built lines of equal efficiency, which made it possible to single out the preference areas for each pair of estimates considered. Findings of the research show that M-estimates are more efficient than the least squares and least absolute deviation estimates if the distribution of the innovation process slightly deviates from the normal distribution. Finally, we give recommendations on the use of these estimates in practical applications. © 2017 BMSTU.",Asymptotic normality; Asymptotic relative efficiency; M-estimates; Threshold autoregression model; Tukey distribution,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048521143

We review here whether volunteering is essentially independent of other leisure activities or is causally associated with some other leisure activities. Volunteering types cluster empirically among themselves in survey data and with other socio-culturally approved leisure activities in a seldom-noticed leisure general activity pattern (LGAP). The existence of the LGAP can be explained mainly by three factors: (1) pressure of social norms (social conformity) regarding approved ways to spend leisure time; (2) social contagion among an individual’s close people, influencing the person to engage in other LGAP activities; and (3) the Active-Effective Character (AE-C), as a combination of personality and attitude factors. People high on LGAP are often the civic core in modern societies, a small proportion of people doing most of the active leisure/civic activities. © David Horton Smith, Robert A.

Dominant status theory (DST) predicts greater participation for individuals with a more dominant (valued and preferred by the socio-cultural system) social status or set of these, such as higher socio-economic status (SES) or involvement in a higher status religion (Smith 1994). The validity of Smith’s revised dominant status theory (RDST), as stated here, is compared with the validity of Wilson’s (2000) resource-capital theory (R-CT), which predicts more volunteering for individuals who have more of various kinds of resources-capital. Although differential validation is difficult, we argue that RDST is superior in giving a more nuanced approach to resources that explains their variations in explanatory/predictive power across contemporary societies and over historical time in any society. Recent research by Smith (2016b) on Russian national sample interview data confirms that the psychology of RDST is far more important than the resources of R-CT. © David Horton Smith, Robert A.

Contrary to the existing tradition which recognizes doubleness only within a single work, the author argues that doubles may be characters from different works connected by their cultural kinship and similarity in their missions. The first part of the article compares the personalities of these two characters and demonstrates the ambiguity of Amleth that is often overlooked by scholars. Having remade the ancient story of Amleth, Shakespeare transformed the personality of the main character. Yet he did not change the basis of the plot without which the narration would make no sense. In the second part of the research, the author analyses the dualism of Amleth, who combines traits of a culture hero and a trickster. While Amleth embodies this most ancient type of doubleness, he, naturally, does not do so in its original form: after all, he is not a caveman but a man of civilization, however primitive it may be. In the third part of the article, Hamlet's inner struggle is presented in the context of a contradiction between his conscious humanistic personality and a subconscious ""shadow"" which requires the Prince of Denmark to follow the norms of archaic heroism. In this connection, the personality of Amleth should be acknowledged not as a mere layer of Hamlet's personality, but as its basis, its ""cultural unconscious."" On the grounds of the ""functional unity"" of the characters, as well as their belonging to the ""world of the heroic"" - though the interpretations of the latter is different - it is concluded that Hamlet and Amleth are ""twin-doubles."". © 2017 Gaidar Institute Press.

The textual variations help us demonstrate that the common view on the history of these texts as directly descending from the only extant set of proof-reads is false. With textual and codicological analysis (including the presentation of three unique copies of the first edition), and using the records of the Academy Chancellery and Typography, we argue that the creation of the unique varying copies of the first edition were caused not only by the fire in the Academy building (December 5, 1747), but also by the lack of paper in the Typography's stock and the fact, that the most part of the book had not yet been written by the time it started to print. For more than a year Lomonosov provided the typography with only small portions of the text, and thus the reprinting the portion of the print run damaged by the fire coincided with the creation of the last chapters. This made it possible for Lomonosov to radically rewrite the first paragraphs of an early chapter ""On fictions,"" turning it into a theoretical text, legitimizing the fiction genres, which became the crucial part of the Academy print in 1747/48 (Volchkov's translation of the Aesop's Fables; the translations of the Fenelons' Telemaque and Barclay's Argenis; Sumarokov's tragedies). The article concludes with a verified stemma of the print sources of the ""Kratkoe rukovodstvo,"" issued during Lomonosov's lifetime; and the Moscow edition (1759-1765) is argued to present the latest authorized text. © 2017 Andrei A.

The Holy Alliance as a vision of international order is often presented to be diametrically opposed to the more radical, republican imagining of global order such as that associated with Immanuel Kant’s Perpetual Peace. This chapter shakes up this view by analysing the importance of Kant’s ideas in the intellectual formation of one of the most influential Russian imperial political thinkers of this period, Sergey Uvarov.

However, to the IS support it is very important to have the latest model that reflects the current system behavior. To correct the model the information from the event log of the system may be used. In this paper, we consider the problem of process model adjustment (correction) using the information from event log. The input data for this task is the initial process model (a Petri net) and an event log. The result of correction should be a new process model, better reflecting the real IS behavior than the initial model. The new model could be also built from scratch, for example, with the help of one of the known algorithms for automatic synthesis of the process model from an event log. However, this may lead to crucial changes in the structure of the original model, and it will be difficult to compare the new model with the initial one, hindering its understanding and analysis. Then it is important to keep the initial structure of the model as much as possible. In this paper we propose a method for process model correction based on the principle of “divide and conquer”. The initial model is decomposed into several fragments. For each of the fragments its conformance to the event log is checked. Fragments, which do not match the log, are replaced by newly synthesized ones. The new model is then assembled from the fragments via transition fusion. The experiments demonstrate that our correction algorithm gives good results when it is used for correcting local discrepancies. The paper presents the description of the algorithm, the formal justification for its correctness, as well as the results of experimental testing on artificial examples. © 2017, Allerton Press, Inc.",divide and conquer; Petri nets; process mining; process model decomposition; process model repair,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042228433

Foucault's approach in biopolitics is analyzed, with man's capital being a key conception. According to the conception, psychological measurement of biopolitics that includes the analysis of roles of institutes of motherhood and family, education, culture in man's capital formation, study of person's migratory activity and inclination to innovations requires special attention. It is stressed that interdisciplinary projects in the sphere of biopolitics cannot claim to be exhaustive in case psychological measurements are excluded from them.

The following factors have a significant impact on bond yields: Indicators of intangible assets, R&D expenses, the composition of a team of managers, the size of the Board of directors. Possession of intangible assets and an increase in the number of patents raises yields of quoted corporate bonds. Existence of R&D for Russian companies is a positive signal for creditors - yields of corporate bonds decline.

The basis of the project is the criminal law doctrine of Russia that includes: 1) specific rules regarding the content of criminal law and thus ensuring its inner quality (social conditioning of specific criminal law solutions, specialization of criminal law norms by branches of law, systemic character of criminal law regulations, ideological orientation of criminal law ensured by the continued observance of the tasks and principles of criminal law, etc); 2) general and special rules of drawing criminal law regulations that ensure the external quality of criminal law (rules of criminal law norms’ wording, construction of corpus delicti, construction of criminal law norms’ sanctions, etc.). The research shows the necessity of introducing a larger system of sections for the Special Part, replacing the existing six sections with eleven, thus almost doubling their number. They introduce one absolutely new section dedicated to the criminal law protection of intellectual property and computer information. Other new sections of the Special Part result from the breaking-up of those already present in the active Criminal Law. The majority of amendments were introduced in the sanctions of the Articles of the Special Part to restore their lost systemic character (in particular, lower limits of punishment were reintroduced in most sanctions of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). To ensure the optimal differentiation of criminal liability, the authors developed a model for the structure of offences that takes into account the most typical circumstances heightening the degree of public danger of a criminal offence. At the same time, the authors consistently apply the principle of widening the limits of criminalization. In quantitative terms, the Special Part of the Criminal Code became smaller due to the decriminalization of many crimes of small gravity. © 2017, Baikal National University of Economics and Law.

However, even with the large number of theoretical and empirical studies focusing on different aspects of university research innovation activities, so far, the problems of the development of military or dual-use technologies by universities has been poorly covered in economic literature. In this article, the specifics of university science participation in defense research and development is examined using the example of the Russian higher education institutes. It is shown that Russian universities are poorly involved in defense-related activities.

The actual problems and obstacles impeding the development of university research activities in the interests of the defense industry are identified, including the traditional focus of industrial companies on their own research divisions and sectoral research institutes and design bureaus, weak information about the current opportunities and achievements of university science, and the inadequate activity of universities in promoting their own research competencies and an image of advanced R&D centers.

Design: The online gaming interface Minecraft was used to construct (on computer screens) complex structures such as buildings from ready-made blocks. Two modes were used: individual and dyadic. Participants (N=49, 29 males and 20 females, 18 to 29 years old, recruited on a snow-ball basis) were required to build staying at a distance two complex structures - a ship and a house; each structure was required to be highly creative, i.e. unusual and never seen before. Creativity was evaluated not by the final structure but by the number of ideas generated by the participants and produced either in practice or verbally. Each participant participated once in an individual and once in a dyadic session; the partners were selected randomly. The participants' verbal activity and digital operations with the Minecraft interface were recorded using the FastStone Capture software package. All the ideas produced by participants were classified in accordance with the following criteria: type (conceptual, functional, selective, corrective, and intentional); level of the structure which the ideas referred to (the whole structure, a particular component of the structure, or an element of the structure); and the status of the verbalized ideas (implemented or unimplemented). Results and Conclusion: The results show that participants produced significantly more ideas and took significantly less time to build the prescribed structure (a house or a ship) within the individual session compared to the dyadic session. The originality of their ideas was measured by two psychologists independently: the two measures turned out to be close (r=0.876); the number of original ideas produced during individual and dyadic sessions do not differ significantly. Analysis of the implementation of the ideas showed that, within the dyadic sessions, participants produced significantly fewer ideas which were subsequently implemented. For the most part they frequently dropped and left unimplemented ideas referring to the levels of either components or elements of the structure. The results also showed that intentions were the only type of ideas which, after being generated equally often in the individual and dyadic sessions, were more often left unimplemented in the group sessions, compared to the individual sessions. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2017.",creativity; Dyadic vs. individual activity; Idea generation; Minecraft; Online gaming,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040460943

It notes an accelerated rise in prices for analogues of goods banned for import and deterioration of their quality. At the same time, a clear majority of Russia’s population support the import bans. The author attributes this fact to the “great power” (derzhavnost) complex as a component of the national mentality that forms the institutional core of the social order. This conclusion is borne out by the results of numerous opinion surveys, national elections and the president’s approval ratings. Proceeding from Bryan Caplan’s model of irrational voter behavior, the author shows that the demand for irrational behavior is limited by the price it exacts (declining well-being). The losses should constantly increase if the demand is to be effectively limited. Otherwise the negative perception of the losses is weakened and the demand for irrational behavior remains high. Thus, stabilization of the damage caused by counter-sanctions ensures popular support for them. © 2017, Russian Academy of Sciences.

The analysis is based on data from the 24th wave of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS-HSE); a representative sample of 12667 individuals, including 1679 workers. Occupational status was identified using ISCO-08. We show that Russian workers are divided into two groups at a roughly 3:1 ratio. The smaller group possesses high-quality human capital, including advanced professional training and skills in modern digital technologies. This subgroup of workers can form the core of the labour supply for innovative transformations in the Russian economy, but only if such advanced professional training leads to adequate returns in the labour market. Using various specifications of the Mincer equation, we show that the current labour market in Russia does not meet this ideal: the quality of the human capital has practically no effect on the wages of workers. As a result, even workers having a higher quality of human capital do not generally have professional training that matches their employment profile (except for on-the-job training) and do not seek to improve their skills. The article also highlights the role of human capital in the formation of two massive classes in Russian society. The specifics of the first class lies in the fact that its human capital does not act as a differentiating factor for its representatives and the frame of this class is based on the traditional working class.

After describing the historical evolution of the UN climate regime employing the tools of international law, this Article explores the structural, institutional, and legal relationships between the new Paris Agreement and the prior development and content of UN-sponsored efforts on climate protection under the auspices of the 1992 Framework Convention. The need for such an analysis is particularly urgent because the new instrument was purposely not identified as a ""protocol,"" and its relationship to the prior Kyoto Protocol is unclear. This Article consequently traces the development of the universal, UN-anchored climate regime from its origins in the 1990s to the present moment, with particular attention to the structural relationship among its various components and historical junctures. The Article then examines the text and structure of the Paris Agreement, along with its context, against this background. The significance of the Agreement's status as an instrument other than a ""protocol,"" and its uncertain textual and institutional relationship to the prior Kyoto Protocol, receive particular scrutiny. The Article concludes that the Paris Agreement, from a structural and institutional point of view, represents both a break with the past designed to initiate a new, globally-inclusive multilateral approach to climate protection, but also contains indications of continuity with prior questions of global climate policy.",Doha Amendment; Framework Convention on Climate Change; Global warming; International environmental law; Kyoto Protocol; Paris Agreement; Regime theory; Sustainability,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037368213

It uses longitudinal data taken from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, which is a unique nationally representative survey; the sample consists of schoolchildren aged six to14. The methodology makes use of the panel data structure and logit regressions to effectively control for time-invariant determinants of educational achievements, and the method directly controls for socioeconomic status, students’ health, public school, region, age and gender. Consequently, this study accurately measured the isolated effect of cultural activities. The findings suggest that these cultural activities correlated positively with educational progress, as the cultural capital theory predicts. However, participation in these activities without parents did not show significant effects. Therefore, parental participation seems necessary to observe a positive association between cultural activities and educational progress, in accordance with the social capital theory. © 2017 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.",Cultural activities; Cultural capital; Educational progress; Russia logit regression for panel data,,English; Spanish,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037338532

Nodes of the graph corresponds to the stocks and weights of edges are given by some measure of dependence between characteristics of the stocks. The most common characteristic of stocks is their return. In the analysis of network (graphical) models of returns of primary interest are network structures (subgraphs of a complete graph), containing key information about the considered network. Popular network structures are the minimum spanning tree, planar maximally filtered graph, market graph, a cliques and an independent set of the market graph. The problem of identification of network structure is to define the structure from observations. An important characteristic of identification statistical procedure is its uncertainty related with finite sample size. Significant role in this play the joint distribution of returns and the choice of measures of dependence between them. The most common measure of dependence is Pearson's correlation. A wide class of joint distributions of stock returns is represented by elliptical models. However, the procedures based on Pearson correlations are non robust when the joint distribution of returns is deviated from the normal in the class of elliptical distributions. The aim of this work is to present a general approach to construction of robust (distribution free) statistical procedures of identification of network structures. It is proposed to use the probability of sign coincidence of stock returns as a measure of dependence. It is shown that the single-step and stepwise standard procedure of identification of network structures based on the probability of sign coincidence are robust in the class of elliptical distributions. It allows to recommend these procedures for practical applications.",Financial market; Network (graphical) model; Network structure; Pearson correlation; Probability of sign coincidence,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036671314

The choice of control method was carried out taking into account the investment horizon. A comprehensive model for evaluating the effectiveness of management of the investment portfolio, having as target the function of profit maximization, and as constraints-the level of risk, and the constancy of the weighting factors increase the Sharpe ratio. The most promising is the creation on the basis of algorithms developed special software that can be used by both private investors and managers of investment funds.",Efficient frontier; Fuzzy clustering.; Investment portfolio; Model Markowitz; Rebalancing; Sharpe ratio,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034764045

The objective is to bridge the vast Eurasian continent to reposition Russia from the periphery of Europe and Asia to the centre of a new constellation. Moscow's 'Greater Europe' ambition of the previous decades produced a failed Western-centric foreign policy culminating in excessive dependence on the West. Instead of constructing Gorbachev's 'Common European Home', the 'leaning-to-one-side' approach deprived Russia of the market value and leverage needed to negotiate a more favourable and inclusive Europe. Eurasian integration offers Russia the opportunity to address this 'overreliance' on the West by using the Russia's position as a Eurasian state to advance its influence in Europe. Offering an account steeped in Russian economic statecraft and power politics, this book offers a rare glimpse into the dominant narratives of Russian strategic culture. It explains how the country's outlook adjusts to the ongoing realignment towards Asia while engaging in a parallel assessment of Russia's interactions with other significant actors. The author offers discussion both on Russian responses and adaptations to the current power transition and the ways in which the economic initiatives promoted by Moscow in its project for a 'Greater Eurasia' reflect the entrepreneurial foreign policy strategy of the country. © 2018 Glenn Diesen.",,,English,Book,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033336709

The purpose of this experimental-theoretical study was to identify which regularities of the dynamics of subjective experience and its brain provision underlie the phenomena described as regression and revealed in seemingly very diverse conditions and influences, such as strong emotions, the introduction of alcohol, stress, a variety of diseases. The mechanisms of stress development and stress patterns of adaptation are considered. A comparison of the mechanisms of disease and stress is presented. The evidence that under stress people regress to an earlier, ""childish"" behavior expressed in their preference strategy to support ""their"", even if it is unjust, is presented. Yet these forms of adult behavior differ from the ""child"" organization. The specificity of learning in a situation of stress regression (as in alcohol intoxication) is the demonstration of reversible dedifferentiation: A decrease in the activity of cortical structures. As a result of prolonged existence of stress effects caused by the dis-ease, individual development takes the form of increasing domain-specific differentiation of the systems. The results of the experiments conducted on the mathematical model correspond to the assumption of temporary dedifferentiation as a mechanism to increase the efficiency of learning in a stressful situation. It is argued that regression and its base - reversible dedifferentiation - is not degradation, impaired development, but its natural stage. There are arguments in favor of the fact that the value of dedifferentiation, phenomenologically described as a regression, was the most significant factor not only in fixing it in evolution as a component of stress adaptation, but generally in occurence in situations involving the creation of new and modification of existing adaptations in a changing external and/or internal environment.",Cortical stmctures; Dedifferentiation; Differentiation of the systems; Individual experience; Learning; Memory; Norm and pathology; Regression,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033213203

First, to understand recombinant innovation (RI) as a potentially significant part of an open innovation (OI) strategy and second, to suggest key routines which would underpin a capability for RI, locating these within the context of enhanced absorptive capacity (AC). Finally, the paper considers how such routines could be developed, drawing on some case examples. Design/methodology/approach: The authors start with a literature review on OI and use the lens of AC to explore challenges in finding, assimilating and deploying external knowledge posed by the emerging knowledge-rich context of OI. The authors then explore one OI route – RI – and suggest a model framework for operationalizing it based on routines for search, acquisition, assimilation and deployment. Findings: The authors suggest three sets of routines required for RI, around abstract-driven search (ADS), brokerage and cyclic adaptation. As with much of the now widely available toolkit for OI, the challenge is one of moving from potential to realized opportunity and this will require investments in learning and capability building.

These 4 regions were: Murmansk region and Komi Republic (for females), Archangelsk region (for both sexes) and Republic Sakha (Yakutia) (for males). The following regions displayed mortality reduction which was close to national averages or less: YaNAO, KhMAO and Magadan region. Mortality rates among males declined faster than that among females. Relatively lower mortality indicators in the territories of YaNAO and KhMAO could likely be attributed to migration of the population to mid-latitude regions with accumulated burden of northern pathology. Mortality reduction tendencies from the leading death causes (diseases of circulatory system, respiratory diseases, external causes) in the region are close to national averages. The most strongly mortality reduced from brain strokes, myocardial infarction and external causes of death. The mortality rates and the mortality dynamics can be described as relatively positive in the region on the whole, except for ""other diseases of circulatory system"" category, where mortality rates exceeded national average twice in particular years. Life expectancy in the Arctic region is close to that in Russia, except two autonomous regions - Khanty-Mansiisky and Yamalo- Nenetsky, where life expectancy was higher than national average by 1.7 and 2.6 years among males and by 0.4 and 0.7 years among females, respectively.

The author proceeds from the fact that, existing in a competitive political environment, conservatism faces challenges of a changing public demand for policies, due to both the socio-economic situation and changing demographic composition of the population. The author shows how radicalism increased in response to frustration of the society and analyzes the roots of the radical and powerful demand for right populism in the United States in general. For decades, democratic political regimes provided stability both in politics and economics: population of these counties profited from integration, globalization, ""open economy"": therefore, dominant position of establishment - the political ""center"", left- and center-right parties was accepted without doubt. However, the last decades changed this trend. American conservatism, on the one hand, found a new base of support that helped Republican candidates win in the elections; on the other hand, conservatism deepened the divisions and contradictions in American society, and thus came into a conflict with a number of other traditional settings of conservatism.

A study was conducted to discover dynamics of subjective experience and brain activity lying at the foundation of phenomena described as regression and observed in seemingly heterogeneous phenomena, such as stress, illness, violent emotions, alcoholic intoxication. The paper discusses the notion of regression from different angles, including the systemic evolutionary approach, and analyzes its potential brain and neuro-genetic mechanisms. It has been experimentally proved that a high degree of alcoholic intoxication causes regression brought about by reverse de-differentiation: A relative increase of representation of lowly differentiated systems in actual experience. In experimental situations of learning in animals lowered activation of neurons of the first (drinking) skill was observed in the process of development of the second (eating) skill. In order to discover effects of alcohol on the general pattern of moral judgements the authors analyzed dynamics of the index of moral acceptance of the death of one for the sake of many. Complexity of behavior is simplified under alcohol and individual differences in pro-social behavior become less expressed. Findings demonstrate similarities in assessments of socially meaningful actions under alcohol, which, the authors believe, points to the effect of alcohol as ""de-differentiator"" causing regression. The effects may be linked to the general mechanism of reversible de-differentiation which determines repression of a number of systems (and, consequently, of activity of a number of neurons) in the most differentiated ""complex"" systems. This simplification may be linked to accelerated learning and also to the fact that organization of behavior becomes more uniform.",Gene expression; Individual experience; Learning; Memory; Norm and pathology; Specialization of neurons; Systemic genesis,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028467756

The search for its causes generated many theories and views. On the one hand, we can hardly perceive it beyond the peculiar socio-historical development of the Russian society and specific historical situation. On the other hand, starting from the Modern Era, many countries were 'taken ill' with revolutions. In the present article the author analyzes the Russian Revolution in connection with the world historical process, defines some common causes of revolutions and shows in what way these causes have manifested in our history, he also reveals the similarity of the Russian Revolution with other significant revolutions as well as distinguishes its peculiarities. This gives an opportunity to answer the questions whether the Russian Revolution was inevitable and whether the drastic social transformations that took place in the first period of the Soviet history were inevitable either. The focus of the present article lies on the correlation between revolution and modernization, on the interconnections, threats and traps that result from an accelerated development of a society and can lead to revolutions. Starting from the Modern era the revolutions are underpinned in most cases by considerable disproportions in the societal development resulting from an accelerated modernization. These disproportions are aggravated by a fast population growth and by an extremely sharp increase of the share of urban population in the structure of society. The article demonstrates how and why the revolutions occur during the periods after some (sometimes long) increase in the living standards of population and growing expectations, as well as why the revolutions are possible just in the societies successful in economic terms as it was with the pre-revolutionary Russia. The conclusion is made that the revolution at a certain stage of modernization is more probably a predicted pattern than a random event. The article reveals the mechanism that brings a society into a peculiar-type trap - the modernization one. While the Malthusian trap is believed to be connected with a lag of productive forces from population growth rates and the generally insufficient transformational dynamics, the modernization trap, on the contrary, is associated with extremely rapid changes which leave behind some most important societal relations and institutions. In Russia there originated a peculiar type of modernization trap - the Malthusian-Marxian one.",Crisis; Democracy; Deprivation; Elevated expectations; Historical process; Modernization; Modernization trap; Political regime; Revolution; The Malthusian trap; The Malthusian-Marxian trap; The Russian revolution; The youth bulge,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028337180

Catastrophic events of the first half of the twentieth century helped to transform this avant-garde linguistic Utopia into a defensive position of a mind seeking, amidst reigning chaos, refuge in an immanent intellectual order built on its own premises, an order that allowed to repel as irrelevant any empirical reality that did not fit into those premises.

Findings: The current evolution of HRM arrangements in the Russian manufacturing subsidiaries of MNCs can be explained by an attempt for ambidexterity.

The authors speculate that the system of social benefits will need to be adjusted again to transform the system from one that is “crisis-proof” to one that is “stagnation adapted.” Originality/value: The findings provide a basis for a broader discussion on mutation of HRM systems in manufacturing subsidiaries of MNCs facing deteriorating market conditions. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Human resource management; Manufacturing subsidiaries; Multinational corporations; Russia; Surveys,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027296323

Multinational corporations pursuing a Cronus parenting style emphasise exploitation and demonstrate a proclivity for continuously extracting value from their subsidiary units. Multinationals following a Rhea parenting style focus on adding value to their subsidiaries and place a strong emphasis on care and accommodation in parent-subsidiary interactions. Zeus style multinational parents encourage heroism among their offspring, something that is commonly leveraged through adding financial value to the subsidiary and extracting a range of other types of value in return. Those multinational parents pursuing an Athena parenting style place an emphasis on developing and safeguarding wisdom in their subsidiaries and display a continuous desire for a balanced exchange of value in their on-going interactions. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Corporate parenting styles; Headquarters; Multinational companies; Russia; Subsidiaries,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026884703

An overview of entrepreneurship research priorities in last decades shows that entrepreneurship's nature, extent and contribution to economic growth depend on the context in which it occurs. Contextual approach provides a deeper insight into adult's Intrinsic incentives to become entrepreneurial that vary according to the regional ""matrix"" in which individuals exist and develop. We consider a problem statement, principles of interpretation, multidimensional statistical methodology and its perspectives for entrepreneurship research in the regional context. We proved that databases from the official statistics and microdata of adult population social surveys in this area need to be combined to develop a body of evidence-based knowledge on entrepreneurial context. The contextual-Approach was interpreted in terms of factor analysis (FA) as a statistical method to regroup interrelated variables into a limited set of unobserved factors based on a shared common variance and dimension reduction. The essential aim of analysis was a ""parsimony"" enabling to discover the simplest method of interpretation for Rosstat data on the regional EFC. On the base of FA procedure we identified 3 latent factors (instead of the primary set of 144 regional economic and social indicators) that can be interpreted as ""Well-being"", ""Investment problems"" and ""Social problems"". These unobservable variables could not be directly measured but they are hypothetical constructs represented a surrounding medium of entrepreneurship. The reduced database was applied for two-step clustering set of 79 Russian regions covered by GeoRating Survey in 2011 (FOM, about 60 thous. of respondents, 18 variables harmonized with Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Questionnaire) into three homogeneous regional clusters by the type of entrepreneurial context. The first cluster consisted of 6 prosperous regions; the rest regions were determined as disadvantaged areas and subdivided into clusters of ""The lack of investment"" regions and of ""The most socially deprived"" regions. Using multidimensional statistical methodology on the base of comparable and geographically coherent regional statistics on EFC in conjunction with adult population surveys microdata, the paper argued, one might consider and explain barriers and stimuli of entrepreneurship development in compliance with special regional features of entrepreneurial context reflected in terms of proposed typology. It is found that the type of entrepreneurial context determines the more of an indirect influence on individuals' decision to be entrepreneurial. The different regional clusters that are homogeneous by the entrepreneurial context show peculiar factors influencing individuals' optimism or pessimism on business prospects in a region both for entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial population.","Cluster analysis; Contextual approach; Cross-regional comparisons, entrepreneurial framework conditions; Entrepreneurial activity; Entrepreneurship research; Factor analysis; Multidimensional statistical methods",,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024926450

The most well-known theoretical works on the subject describe the different types of isomorphism, path dependence, the spread of new organizational models and institutional building aimed at strengthening the existing models. The enlightenment of a single trend simplifies the analysis, but does not grab the complexity of empirical reality. Therefore the author defends the synthetic approach that claims the institutionalization of new organizational models to be the result of mutual influence of the existing institutions and organizational practices. The author describes theory of strategic action fields, created by N. Flfgstein and D. McAdam as an explanation of this synthetic approach.

An alternative hypothesis originates from the consumer ethnocentrism approach, assuming that the signal of foreign ownership will provide an incentive for depositors to monitor the banks more attentively. We use data on 56 foreign banks for 2007- 2015. The results suggest that if the bank's title signals the foreign origin, the deposit growth is significantly more sensitive to a decrease in the capital adequacy ratio or in credit risk, which indicates the ethnocentrism effect, working for disciplining by both quantity and price. The effect for quantitative discipline persists during the crisis of 2008-2009, which is important due to the fact, that this period witnessed the significant inflow of deposits to state and foreign banks from national private ones.

First, we present an approach to create user profiles that measure a user's interest in various topics mined from the full texts of the items. As a result, we get a user profile that can be used, e.g., for cold start recommendations for items, targeted advertisement, and other purposes; our experiments show that the interests mining method performs on a level comparable with collaborative algorithms while at the same time being a cold start approach, i.e., it does not use the likes of an item being recommended. Second, we study the problem of predicting a user's demographic attributes such as age and gender based on his or her full-text items.

Irrational beliefs mean systematic rather than random errors. Voters frequently vote according to their embedded prejudices because the private costs of their errors are equal to zero. Zero costs are the result of practically zero chance to be decisive voter: the single vote has no effect on the election outcome. In this case it is rational to receive psychological benefits from manifestation of beliefs taking any devastating decisions at the poll station. As a result political irrationality may be compared with environment pollution. In both cases, the private benefits of self-restraints are absent. The burden of welfare state in the West and massive support of counter-sanctions in Russia reveal voter's rational irrationality. For the welfare state vote and those for whom tax increase is expensive: in fact, each of the losers know that his personal choice in the voting does not affect the result. Instead they satisfy their sense of justice. The situation with the popular support of counter-sanctions in Russia is rather similar. Psychological benefits as the result of symbolic counter-sanctions support are clearly not zero in contrast to the costs of personal choice at the national elections where the weight of single vote means nothing, An analysis of voter behavior clearly shows that universal and unrestricted suffrage allows irrational beliefs of the masses to form an ineffective policy.

Each agent has one unit of labor, and he is a neutral to the risk and indifferent to the individual leisure. An agent have two variants of behavior: he can become wage-worker in a perfectly competitive labor market and receive at the same time the equilibrium wage. Another option - he can open his own company (which he devoted all his time), and hire workers in the labor market. Every entrepreneur has a production function depending on his managerial ability. Businessman chooses the optimal amount of hired labor that maximizes his profit. It is shown that the introduction of an extremely small tax does not affect the aggregate output in the economy, and increases the supply of labor and reduces wages. A further increase in the tax rate leads to a growing negative impact on the total supply of the product. It is shown that these conclusions are correct in the case where the tax base is an accounting rather than economic profit. The introduction of the tax on economic profit in fact coincide with the simultaneous introduction of tax on accounting profit and wages, with the result that the parameters do not change the balance in the economy.

First, because of the peculiar properties of supply and demand of young and older people's labor force, direct competition between two groups is limited. By the supply side young and older workers have significant differences in qualifications they have. By the demand side even though their wages are almost equal, workplaces they occupy are also different if we compare them with the jobs occupied by 30-49 year old workers. Second, we used regional characteristics of the labor market and showed that there is no effect of the one of the groups' employment on the employment and unemployment of the other group. Therefore, the young and the older workers are not competitors on Russian labor market. On the contrary specialization of each group on their own professions and sectors creates the possibility for interaction in Russia.

A review of how such evaluation are defined is presented, as in this context that the scope and limitations of IEQ are fixed. Firstly, IEQ produces an evaluation of the conditions and resources behind social programs, rather than considering their products, effects or impact. Secondly, the indicators and criteria used for evaluation are determined in advance and legally regulated. Finally, IEQ is focused on providing a summative rating of organizations or, in other words, employing a linear model of measurement of institutional activity. To overcome these constraints, the inclusion of additional data collection methods could be implemented to gain a more holistic evaluation of the conditions and resources of the organization. This article explores the methodical audit of IEQ; this entails looking at the relevance of chosen techniques of data gathering and the construction of rating scales. The empirical basis of this paper emerges from the application of IEQ methodology to rate twenty-eight Moscow-based centres that provide social assistance to families and children. The use of a mixed methods research (MMR) and, in particular, the design of additional covering allowed diverse data to be gathered; the process of comparing and integrating this data was described in detail method by methods. Presented here are examples of how to combine standardized and participative observation, visual data and field notes, formalized survey and 'interviews with interviewers'.

This includes the absence of public service media as an institutional force and the powerful paternalistic role played by the Russian state. These conditions have resulted in the emergence of a special set of mechanisms at play in the social functioning of mass media in Russia; that of state 'informational contracts'. This research is based on a comprehensive database of these contracts, including all contracts signed between state agencies and media companies from 2011 to 2014 in four Russian regions: The Republic of Tatarstan, Tomsk region, Rostov region, and the Republic of Mordovia. The implementation of a quantitative analysis demonstrated a number of inequalities between the regions of this sample. One area where dramatic differences could be observed was in the amount of financing and the number of signed contracts. More often than not state customers came from government bodies while, in contrast, the media suppliers were commercial companies. The main media channels used to spread the information specified in the contracts were common to all the regions, both in press media and television. A significant part of the contracts from our database concern how the activities of regional and municipal authorities are to be covered. However, there is an uneven share of contracts with such topics in the regions from the sample. What is revealed is how prevalent such informational contracts are in regional media markets, to the extent that they have become an embedded practice. It would be misleading to interpret this as no more than a form of state support to media outlets struggling from a lack of advertising revenue in the regions; these contracts also allow mass media to fulfill a version of social responsibility. At the same time, state intervention and the lack of control from the audience lead to a situation where socially significant information is closely intertwined with ensuring to loyalty to the authorities. By providing funds and playing the role of customers, the state authorities offer their own interpretation of what items are of 'social and public significance' to them, as well as deciding the level of attention given to certain topics in the mass media. © 2017 The Journal of Social Policy Studies.","Media market, information contracts, social function of media, Rostov region, Tomsk region, Republic of Tatarstan, Republic of Mordovia",,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019046232

At the same time, studying the activity of employers in developing entrepreneurship, taking risks and seeing opportunities in this area is important to foster understanding how social relations are configured in business. The theoretical framework of this study was based on classic and modern trends and the use of social and labor relations models in a market economy. It was also inspired by research done on the condition of social and labor relations in Russia as a whole, and in SME specifically. The empirical base of the research was made up of in-depth interviews with employers, owners and hired top managers of SMEs in Nizhny Novgorod and the Nizhny Novgorod Region. The findings suggest that a specific understanding and implementation of employers of subjectivity in social and labor relations exist, which are mainly aimed at preserving minimum guarantees and motivation for employees. On the other hand, the employer's problems are isolated and in most cases resolved in the course of natural adaptation and adjustment to the situation. The employers only partially control employment in their area and do not consider it necessary to participate in managing this. Subjectivity is truncated but this allows the employer to maintain a balance of relations at the micro level in case of conflict and interdependencies when relations of domination cannot be simply reduced to raw arbitrariness. With such a view the employer plays the role of the driving factor, although in this case it is in essence only a minimalist account of the interests and needs of employees. © 2017 The Journal of Social Policy Studies.",Employer; Labour relations; Small and medium business; State,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019044551

It is stated that intangibles bring extra information asymmetry into a company and make managers and investors’ goals less aligned. Design/methodology/approach: A theoretical model is elaborated and empirically tested on the assumption that managers, while investing in intangibles, simultaneously make a company competitive and attractive to investors. The authors use a conceptual model of endogenous value creation to test how intangibles affect outperforming of a company and provoke the expectations of investors. The research is carried out on a sample of more than 1,650 European companies covering the period from 2004 to 2011. Structural equation modelling is applied for the purposes of empirical analysis. Findings: The authors reveal a diverse impact of intangibles on outperforming of a company measured by economic value added and its ability to create market value. The study discovers that managers are prone to indicate positive signals to investors rather than create sustainable competitive advantages. Practical implications: This research emphasizes on the particular importance of awareness of policymakers, namely, companies’ top managers, about the outcomes of their decisions. Decision-making in public companies should involve as much deliberation as possible about the potential impact of what is decided. Originality/value: This work contributes primarily to the field of corporate finance in companies that use intangibles. The endogenous process of value creation is modelled and tested.

Design/methodology/approach: The study implements an intellectual capital-based view and the concept of novelty proposed by Schumpeter to highlight the crucial role of knowledge for transition to a higher level of competition. Drawing on a literature review, the authors determine three specific components of IC: foreign human capital, information and communication technology (ICT) capital developed at an international level and cooperation with foreign partners in order to pinpoint a premier position on the next level of the market. For empirical testing of the proposed model, a data set comprising more than 1,400 Russian manufacturing SMEs was used. Estimations were performed with the help of a principal component analysis and ordinal logistic regression. Findings: The findings reveal that higher (IC) endowment promotes the level of product novelty. For Russian manufacturing SMEs, the most important is R&D capital. At the same time, ICT capital developed at an international level and cooperation with foreign partners contribute significantly to the probability of transition to a new market level. Research limitations/implications: The study employs cross-sectional data that restrict the analysis of innovation dynamics. Practical implications: The study appears to have policy implications for the development of governmental programmes for Russian SMEs such as the creation of IC awareness, training for IC management, special programmes for R&D support and ICT capital accumulation. Originality/value: This paper proposes a new approach for investigating the “knowledge-innovation” link, shifting the focus from a general analysis of product innovation to a level of novelty for product innovation. This is the first empirical study of the relationship between IC components and the level of product novelty for SMEs in the context of the Russian business environment. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Intellectual capital; Novelty level; Product innovation; Russia; SMEs,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016273120

Design/methodology/approach: The framework of resources-based view is used to examine causality between the resources used and competitiveness measured by economic value added (EVA). Controlling for the most relevant factors, the authors place an emphasis on those intangible resources that are considered in the literature as being the most critical for Russian companies when contending for global competitiveness: productivity, strategic long-term orientation of companies, quality of human capital, innovative behavior of companies, foreign investments and corporate networks. The data set of more than 1,000 Russian companies benchmarked to the data set of more than 1,600 European companies during a period of 10 years: 2004-2013 is analyzed to test the hypothesis put forward. Findings: Causal effect of the gap in intangible endowment and competitiveness of Russian companies compared with European rivals is revealed. According to our analysis, gaps in productivity, strategy implementation, qualifications of the board of directors and company location play critical roles in the global competitiveness of Russian companies. Meanwhile, underinvestment in structural resources, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and other intangible assets, are considered positive factors that reduce gaps in EVA.

While this sample is obviously not representative of general population, it arguably allows comparing crucial expectations arising from the two theories. Due to specifics of admission procedure, it included young people who were endowed with high levels of cultural capital (passing highly competitive exams) and those who were endowed with economic capital (paying high tuition fees) interacting with each other on an almost daily basis. It follows from Bourdieu's treatment of cultural capital that co-existence of members of different factions of societal elite would inevitably result in high cultural capital group rejecting the tastes of a less sophisticated audience and in this way establishing its superiority. In contrast, ""cultural omnivore""/""cultural mobility"" theory expects a more peaceful coexistence with high cultural capital group developing liking, rather than disliking, for objects consumed by low cultural capital group and using them as a communicative resource. An innovative aspect of this study is that, instead of using regressions to find correlations between quality and quantity of tastes and class position of individuals to whom these tastes belong, we rely on testing competing hypotheses concerning the organizations of spaces of tastes as such. The specific hypotheses derived specify (1) the overall distribution of artistic tastes (the polarization of the high- and the low-brow tastes vs centre-periphery structure with mainstream and consensual tastes in the middle), (2) homology of different forms of high culture vs segmented forms of cultural consumption, (3) distribution of accounts of liking as portrayed against the background of cultural knowledge. Generally, our findings yield full support for the cultural omnivore model. Counter the snob model, high cultural capital group demonstrates significantly more liking for the most familiar and accessible artistic figures, than low cultural capital group. We discuss the implications of these findings with regard to other aspects of Bourdieu's theoretical contributions and our understanding of status boundaries in modern Russia.",Bourdieu; Cultural capital; Cultural consumption; Cultural omnivorousness; Social space (mapping); Status boundaries,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014507808

We describe and interpret the ideas of justice operating in this location, as well as revealing the influence of the cultural and social context on the formation of similar practices. The empirical base of the article was taken from a court case in Ulyanovsk Regional Court, which concerned a conflict between two women, both of whom resided in a nearby workers' settlement. At the heart of the judicial proceeding was a struggle to obtain a place in the public municipal cemetery and install a fence, table and bench there. The participants in this dispute were convinced of the legitimacy of their respective claims and, in 2013, they referred the matter to Ulyanovsk Regional Court, which was forced to rule on 'shadow' practices not typically regulated by the law. From the standpoint of a regulatory approach, informal practices are viewed as a response to inconsistencies in federal, regional and local regulations over ritual burial services. However, the cultural and social context still must be clarified, and it is here there are two conclusions that can be drawn. Firstly, Russia's funeral services market is still very much in the shadow of Soviet funeral practices, where the main prerogative was to delegate all burial responsibilities to municipalities. This meant that for a number of decades it was common practice for many Soviet citizens to bury their relatives by themselves; this includes making graves and coffins, and searching for a burial place. In examining this court case we find that many of these practices continue to exist in modern Russia. Secondly, the practice of allocating space in the cemetery itself is a complex form of bargaining and agreement, often based on local traditions. Thus, this practice became a resource of justification for the claims of plaintiffs', creating their special order of worth. This study shows, above all, how different orders of worth confront and interact with one another. © 2017 The Journal of Social Policy Studies.",Case-study; Cemetery; Informal practices; Justification,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014480001

In this work, we identify two important problems along the way to using topic models in qualitative studies: lack of a good quality metric that closely matches human judgement in understanding topics and the need to indicate specific subtopics that a specific qualitative study may be most interested in mining. For the first problem, we propose a new quality metric, tf-idf coherence, that reflects human judgement more accurately than regular coherence, and conduct an experiment to verify this claim. For the second problem, we propose an interval semi-supervised approach (ISLDA) where certain predefined sets of keywords (that define the topics researchers are interested in) are restricted to specific intervals of topic assignments. Our experiments show that ISLDA is better for topic extraction than LDA in terms of tf-idf coherence, number of topics identified to predefined keywords and topic stability. We also present a case study on a Russian LiveJournal dataset aimed at ethnicity discourse analysis. © The Author(s) 2015.",Latent Dirichlet allocation; LDA extensions; topic modelling; topic quality,Statistics; Discourse analysis; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Latent dirichlet allocations; LDA extensions; Opinion analysis; Qualitative study; Quality metrices; Topic extraction; Data mining,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011601372

The authors investigate whether it is reasonable for companies to intensify intangibles when the current strategy is not intangible-intensive. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate a theoretical model to describe the strategic decision making in companies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the Bellman-equation framework to find the conditions under which a change in strategy for intangibles is reasonable. Findings: The results determine the parameters of returns on intangibles in different strategies, the optimal intangible stock and the influence of external economic shocks. The findings of the study demonstrate that many requirements have to be met to make intangible-intensive strategy beneficial for a company. Moreover negative shocks of crises force a company to postpone a new strategy on intangibles. Practical implications: This research provides an insight into strategic behavior of companies under uncertainty. The theoretical findings demonstrate under which conditions companies should decide to switch to a strategy more intangible-intensive. This model can be used to empirically test parameters of different investment strategies of companies using structural estimation techniques. Originality/value: This work contributes to the theory of managerial economics giving closed form solutions for the dynamic optimization of company behavior. The findings also show how this behavior might change when economic crises are faced or expected. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Bellman equation; Dynamic optimization; Intangible-intensive strategy,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009754104

The participants were eight undergraduate students who attended six weekly tutoring sessions that combined face-to-face (F2F) RFL instruction with VT activities. VT allowed them to access text-based, graphic, video, and aural linguistic input; record and store audio/video-recorded output; listen and comment on peers' recordings; and receive individualized teacher feedback on oral performance. Data from activity logs and researcher field notes were triangulated with participants' responses to two surveys and a semi-structured oral interview. Findings indicated that participants believed that VT supported their oral proficiency development through the provision of additional time and resources for independent planning, rehearsal, and controlled production of L2 forms. Most participants also agreed that VT's playback and record features were the most beneficial for developing language skills, enhancing the reflection process, and facilitating self-assessment and creativity in the L2. Yet, despite VT's multimodal affordances and the availability of communicative tasks via VT, participants did not perceive VT as a social environment that could promote peer-to-peer interaction or replace F2F communication. A thematic data analysis suggested that participants' preferences for language learning tasks influenced their strategic uses of VT's features, which ultimately affected their perceptions of VT's value for promoting meaningful language learning interactions.

Some of these were recorded in writing, although, as a rule, with a signifcant delay, when the rules themselveswere about to fall out of use. Others, despite remaining unwritten, regulated many aspects of everyday dynastic life, which repeatedly confirmed their existence. This refers not only to ceremonial and dynastic etiquette, but also to a kind of family predestination compelling various dynasty members and their immediate circle to take on certain roles and behave incertain ways and not others. One of the spheres regulated by such unwritten but very effective norms was that of name-giving. Based on evidence from various European royal courts between the 9th and early 13th centuries, we can identify a set of parameters according to which names could be given to members of the ruling family and establish which of these parameters were relevant to each dynasty. In Rus', Scandinavia, and other countries converted in the tenth and eleventh centuries, the gradual adoption of Christian names did not at first have a negative or destructive impact on the pagan tradition of naming. The traditional pagan corpus of names showed an extreme viability, and name-giving remained one of the most stable, conservative spheres of culture. Perhaps the most fully retrievable paired corpuses of pagan and Christian names are those of the dynasty that ruled Rus'. The choice of a name for any individual is of great significance in any tradition. But if a name must be chosen for the prince, for a future ruler, then this naming becomes central to the existence of the dynasty, and, sometimes, to the existence of the country where the dynasty is ruling. The name (or names) of a royal heir determine his place in the dynasty and the status that he may hope to achieve according to the expectations of his parents. In general, the process of name giving was closely connected with strategies of power. © 2017 SISMEL Edizioni del Galluzzo. All rights reserved.",,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049132056

At present, it is customary to assume that in the finite-dimensional smooth dynamical systems three fundamentally different forms of chaos can be observed. This is the dissipative chaos, whose mathematical image is a strange attractor; the conservative chaos, for which the whole phase space is a large «chaotic sea» with elliptical islands randomly disposed within it; and the mixed dynamics which is characterized by the principle inseparability, in the phase space, of attractors, repellers and orbits with conservative behavior. In the first part of this series of our works, we present some elements of the theory of pseudohyperbolic attractors of multidimensional maps. Such attractors, the same as hyperbolic ones, are genuine strange attractors, however, they allow homoclinic tangencies. We also give a description of phenological scenarios of the appearance of pseudohyperbolic attractors of various types for one parameter families of three-dimensional diffeomorphisms, and, moreover, consider some examples of such attractors in three-dimensional orientable and nonorientable Hénon maps. In the second part, we will give a review of the theory of spiral attractors. Such type of strange attractors are very important and are often observed type in dynamical systems. The third part will be dedicated to mixed dynamics – a new type of chaos which is typical, in particulary, for (time) reversible systems i.e. systems which are invariant with respect to some changes of coordinates and time reversing.

The research is based on the multisemiotic theory by Kress and van Leeuwen and supports the view that semiotic codes are used in specific historical, cultural and institutional contexts. It is customary for people to communicate the meaning referring to various codes, depending on the contexts, as codes are not only planned, taught, justified, but also criticized. The authors of this paper make an attempt to prove the hypothesis that Russian and Indian respondents code similar photos differently due to their cultural/ideological backgrounds. According to Kress and van Leeuwen, pictures are images that convey an interactive meaning. Thus, the main focus of the research is on the image viewer interaction. The present study examines the data obtained from 526 official photographs of the Patriarchs and consists of several stages. At the first stage two groups of coders (Indian and Russian) were created. The selected groups were provided to code the collected corpus of photos (in total 526 photographs) autonomously. In case of discrepancies between the coding images, the agreement was terminated by two national coders collaboratively. At the second stage, the semi-structural interviews with the coders were conducted. The interviews allowed to identify and reveal similarities and differences in photo perception. The results of the study show, that the multisemiotic theory can be entirely employed and serve as an effective tool in image analysis within different cultures through identifying the interpersonal (interactive) metafunction. As the research demonstrates limitations like small amount of studied samples and a low number of Indian participants' opinion provided in the Russian Federation, further research in India is recommended. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Reducing the work function is a top-priority task for the designers of all types of cathode materials. The emission properties of composite cathode materials are determined primarily by the properties of their work surface. The investigation of the connection between the structure and physical and chemical properties of the cathode surface and its emission properties is a relevant problem. The understanding of these properties not only gives a mode in-depth perception of the physics behind the processes that occur on the surface of the cathode but also enables purposefully adjusting its properties by reasonably choosing the parameters of the primary components and improving the cathode manufacturing technology. An important parameter of the composite material is the emission homogeneity of its surface which is determined primarily by the homogeneous distribution of the emission active phase and the chemical and structural homogeneity of the work surface of the cathode. This research used methods of scanning electron microscopy and electron probe microanalysis to study the effect of the grain-size composition of primary powder components of a pressed Pd-Ba cathode on the evenness and density of distribution of powder particles of the emission active phase Pd5Ba on its surface. The optimal 5 particle size distribution of powder components was determined. An experimental technique for manufacturing pressed Pd-Ba cathodes was proposed, it enables increasing the evenness of the distribution of the emission active phase across the surface of the cathode. The increase in emission homogeneity reduced the work function of the electron from 2.5-2.4 eV which resulted in a more than 2.5 fold increase in emission current density. © Medwell Journals, 2017.",Composition; Electron; Emission active phase; Emission homogeneity; Grain-size; Microscopy; Pressed Pd-Ba cathode; Research,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047492996

This paper takes a step forward in this direction and focuses on ensuring machine learning models deliver fair decisions. In legal scholarships, the notion of fairness itself is evolving and multi-faceted. We set an overarching goal to develop a unified machine learning framework that is able to handle any definitions of fairness, their combinations, and also new definitions that might be stipulated in the future. To achieve our goal, we recycle two well-established machine learning techniques, privileged learning and distribution matching, and harmonize them for satisfying multi-faceted fairness definitions. We consider protected characteristics such as race and gender as privileged information that is available at training but not at test time; this accelerates model training and delivers fairness through unawareness. Further, we cast demographic parity, equalized odds, and equality of opportunity as a classical two-sample problem of conditional distributions, which can be solved in a general form by using distance measures in Hilbert Space. We show several existing models are special cases of ours. Finally, we advocate returning the Pareto frontier of multi-objective minimization of error and unfairness in predictions. This will facilitate decision makers to select an operating point and to be accountable for it. © 2017 Neural information processing systems foundation.

It was recently shown that Bayesian dropout procedure not only improves generalization but also leads to extremely sparse neural architectures by automatically setting the individual noise magnitude per weight. However, this sparsity can hardly be used for acceleration since it is unstructured. In the paper, we propose a new Bayesian model that takes into account the computational structure of neural networks and provides structured sparsity, e.g. removes neurons and/or convolutional channels in CNNs. To do this we inject noise to the neurons outputs while keeping the weights unregularized. We establish the probabilistic model with a proper truncated log-uniform prior over the noise and truncated log-normal variational approximation that ensures that the KL-term in the evidence lower bound is computed in closed-form. The model leads to structured sparsity by removing elements with a low SNR from the computation graph and provides significant acceleration on a number of deep neural architectures. The model is easy to implement as it can be formulated as a separate dropout-like layer. © 2017 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Formal volunteering (FV), whether for service programs or associations, is most often a kind of serious leisure, defined below. Such activity has its own temporal requirements that have to be coordinated with other use of free time, as well as with paid work and non-work obligations (such as family care or personal care, like sleep). Informal volunteering (INV) — volunteering done more spontaneously by individuals without any organizational auspices — is also discussed, as is the travel related to FV and INV.

Some of these correlates seem to be causal factors influencing volunteering. Volunteers tend to have better physical health, both self-reported and expert-assessed, better mental health, and perform better on cognitive tasks. Research thus far has rarely examined neurological, neurochemical, hormonal, and genetic correlates of volunteering to any significant extent, especially controlling for other factors as potential confounds. Evolutionary theory and behavioral genetic research suggest the importance of such physiological factors in humans. Basically, many aspects of social relationships and social activities have effects on health (e.g., Newman and Roberts 2013; Uchino 2004), as the widely used biopsychosocial (BPS) model suggests (Institute of Medicine 2001). Studies of formal volunteering (FV), charitable giving, and altruistic behavior suggest that physiological characteristics are related to volunteering, including specific genes (such as oxytocin receptor [OXTR] genes, Arginine vasopressin receptor [AVPR] genes, dopamine D4 receptor [DRD4] genes, and 5-HTTLPR). We recommend that future research on physiological factors be extended to non-Western populations, focusing specifically on volunteering, and differentiating between different forms and types of volunteering and civic participation (cf.

We demonstrate that metaphor formation in RSL uses a number of mechanisms: A concrete sign can acquire metaphorical meaning without change, a part of a sequential compound can acquire a metaphorical meaning, and a morpheme within a productive sign or a simultaneous compound can acquire a metaphorical meaning. All these processes have parallels in spoken languages, so we argue for a modality-independent model of metaphor formation where metaphorical mapping is divorced from iconicity. © John Benjamins Publishing Company",Iconicity; Metaphor; Russian Sign Language,,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044675294

Russian youth has become not only more open, dynamic, and mobile, but also more realistic, rational, and pragmatic. The increased aspiration for material welfare, the heightened focus on consumption and the acquisition of material benefits have become very important to young people who have no experience of life in Soviet society. Nevertheless, the importance of these tendencies, developed in the 1990s and 2000s, should not be exaggerated. Recent studies of the Institute of Sociology, Russian Academy of Sciences (IS-RAS), testify that contemporary Russian youth is moderately individualistic and ambitious, such values as family and children, reliable friends, education, and interesting jobs dominate the value structure of youth (Gorshkov and Sheregi, 2010b: 129-131). Unlike youth of the 1990s, who lived under the extremely difficult material conditions, today’s young people are not motivated solely by earning money; they do not accept incessant consumerism, careerism, and they have greater need for self-expression and creative self-realization (Gorshkov et al., 2011). © 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Russian people have changed as well - researchers frequently record processes that show specific dynamics of their consciousness, norms, and values, however, researchers often emphasize that the changes appear to be ambiguous and complicated (Tikhonova, 2011; Magun and Rudnev, 2010). Russian youth is of special interest in this respect. Young Russians were and still are going through secondary socialization in conditions where their identities, norms, and values are being shaped during the period of ongoing countrywide transformations that overlap with the large-scale worldwide processes of globalization, changing international division of labor, emergence of new kinds of inequality and new risks. Besides, the country’s future will be largely determined by norms and values of today’s youth, as they will set the limits on possible vectors of development that may be accepted by the population over the medium and long run. © 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

To a large extent, dual education systems enable young people to acquire not simply technical skills, but broadly defined competencies that serve as the foundation for rewarding careers and social esteem. However, actual implementation of dual education outside the core Germanic countries in Europe has proven to be extremely challenging.

The development of such algorithms can be conducted in different ways, including the classical Bayesian paradigm as well as modern deep learning architectures. The interpretation of nonlinear decision rules implemented by multilayer structures would enable automatic and objective knowledge extraction from the neurocognitive experiments data. Despite the advantages of non-invasive neuroimaging methods, a radical increase in the bandwidth of the BCI communication channel and the use of this technology for the prosthesis control is possible only through invasive technologies.

Unlike in most social research, the focus is on self-reported right-wing extremist everyday behavior (e.g., usage of derogatory language when talking about migrants), not attitudes. The hypothesis is tested that high intergenerational similarity in right-wing extremism requires the frame of a parental ideology that fosters such an orientation: the basis for intergenerational similarity is provided only in those families that have a high level of hierarchic self-interest (HSI, Hagan). In line with findings of socialization research on right-wing extremism, differences in similarities between mothers and fathers, on the one hand, and sons and daughters, on the other hand, are also assumed: Transmission effects should be particularly strong in the fatherson dyad.

They perform vital functions of life, so any disruptions in their structure result in pathologies and diseases. Studies of these proteins with experimental methods are very complicated and expensive, as they require the membrane environment. Despite considerable progress achieved so far in methods of structure determination and property analysis, many computationalmethods are developing to predict the structural and dynamical parameters of proteins in membranes. Among the algorithms of modeling are the homology analysis, de novo structure prediction, molecular dynamics simulations and other. With growing computational capabilities, sophisticated techniques are developed taking into account more environmental factors. Combined approaches with different levels of approximation of intermolecular interactions are widely used. The major interest in studies of membrane proteins is focused on their transmembrane domains that are fundamental structural elements and are constituted by α-helices or helical bundles incorporated into lipid bilayer in most cases. Therefore, the fundamental problem of interaction of a pair of helices in membrane arises: the exact mechanism of this process is still not so clear. In place of the prevailing concept of dimerization motifs that states the importance of protein-protein contacts, a new model of the membrane as an adaptable lipid matrix is proposed. It states that biological membrane can adjust its properties around proteins and also modulates their activity. This mechanism of the mutual influence of two components is challenging modern computationalmethods of membrane modeling because these systems are quite large and includemany components to be treated accurately.

MD is integrated with experimental measurements to form a single pipeline. The pipeline provides a convenient way to determine structural and dynamic properties of biomembranes at molecular level. Nowadays MD simulations are applied to study ever more complex systems containing several lipid species and other non-lipid components. However the choice of certain force field to treat such complex systems is often done on the ground of its validation for one-component systems, which may be a too simplistic approach leading to underestimation of influence of force field on interaction of different lipid species with each other. Here we compare three force fields, namely the united-atom GROMOS43a2x and the all-atom force fields Slipids and CHARMM36.

In this study we seek to measure the overall volume of ethnicity related discussion in the Russian language social media and to develop an approach that would automatically detect various aspects of attitudes to those ethnic groups. We develop a comprehensive list of ethnonyms and related bigrams that embrace 97 Post-Soviet ethnic groups and obtain all messages containing one of those words from a two-year period from all Russian language social media (N = 2,660,222 texts). We hand-code 7,181 messages where rare ethnicities are overrepresented and train a number of classifiers to recognize different aspects of authors’ attitudes and other text features. After calculating a number of standard quality metrics, we find that we reach good quality in detecting intergroup conflict, positive intergroup contact, and overall negative and positive sentiment.

Prior re search has shown that the choice between 'who' and 'which' in Slavic languages is largely dependent on the head type. Some of the languages allow the 'who' pro nouns to be used with pronominal heads, but not with nouns in the head, while in others, the pronominal heads in the plural are also ungrammatical with the pronoun 'who.' The present study aims to complement the available qualitative data on the dis tribution of the relativizers with quantitative data and to propose a unified account for all the observed tendencies. A corpus-based study was con ducted in order to establish language-internal statistical tendencies comparable to the known grammaticali ty restrictions. The results show much agreement be tween the qualitative and quantitative tendencies. Thus, the head 'those,' unlike the head 'that,' is incompatible with the relativizer 'who' in Slovak, Polish, Upper Sorbian, and Lower Sorbian languages, while the same tendency is quantitative in Czech, Slovene, Serbo-Croa tian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, and the older varieties of Russian. Corpus data suggest that there is also a stronger tendency for the relative pronoun 'who' to be avoided with the head 'those' than with the head 'all.' One more relevant parameter is the semantic type of the clause, maximalizing se man tics being the preferred option for 'who.' I suggest that all these and some other tendencies can be subsumed under a macroparameter of the extent to which the head is integrated into the relative clause.",Free relatives; Interrogative pronouns; Light-headed relatives; Relative pronouns; Relativization; Slavic languages,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034215831

The EU and the United States tend to preserve their identity in the areas of consumer and environment protection, standardization, competition. The negotiations become a means of competitive positioning of their models. At the same time it is an example of tolerant interaction of competing poles. The estimate also allows to rethink the outcome of the EU-Russia dialog and to stress its useful results.

Previous studies have shown that brain response to a written word depends on the task: whether the word is a target in a version of lexical decision task or should be read silently. Although this effect has been interpreted as an evidence for an interaction between word recognition processes and task demands, it also may be caused by greater attention allocation to the target word. Objective. We aimed to examine the task effect on brain response evoked by nontarget written words. Design. Using MEG and magnetic source imaging, we compared spatial-temporal pattern of brain response elicited by a noun cue when it was read silently either without additional task (SR) or with a requirement to produce an associated verb (VG). Results. The task demands penetrated into early (200-300 ms) and late (500-800 ms) stages of a word processing by enhancing brain response under VG versus SR condition. The cortical sources of the early response were localized to bilateral inferior occipitotemporal and anterior temporal cortex suggesting that more demanding VG task required elaborated lexical-semantic analysis. The late effect was observed in the associative auditory areas in middle and superior temporal gyri and in motor representation of articulators. Our results suggest that a remote goal plays a pivotal role in enhanced recruitment of cortical structures underlying orthographic, semantic and sensorimotor dimensions of written word perception from the early processing stages. Surprisingly, we found that to fulfil a more challenging goal the brain progressively engaged resources of the right hemisphere throughout all stages of silent reading. Conclusion. Our study demonstrates that a deeper processing of linguistic input amplifies activation of brain areas involved in integration of speech perception and production. This is consistent with theories that emphasize the role of sensorimotor integration in speech understanding. © Russian Psychological Society, 2017.",Magnetoencephalography (MEG); Sensorimotor transformation; Speech lateralization; Top-down modulations; Visual word recognition,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032025905

This paper attempts to estimate the impact of internal and external factors on a firm's competitiveness in the context of optimal enterprise size. The main conclusion is that that the satisfaction of Russian SME managers has been increasing due to factors such as the sufficient supply of qualified personnel, modern infrastructure, developed partnerships, the expansion of the geographical scope of available markets and favorable institutional conditions for entrepreneurship. In contrast, serious constraints to SME growth in Russia discourage entrepreneurs and lead to poor decisions by managers such as exploiting shadow schemes, leaving the market or growth in the form of nominally independent firms under the informal ""umbrella"" of one owner.

This means that essential structural differences between phenotypes (e.g., healthy and diseased) should be reflected in how brain networks cluster into communities. To test this hypothesis, we propose a pipeline to classify brain networks based on their underlying community structure.

The growth of event data provides many opportunities but also imposes new challenges. Process mining is typically done for an isolated well-defined process in steady-state. However, the boundaries of a process may be fluid and there is a need to continuously view event data from different angles. This paper proposes the notion of process cubes where events and process models are organized using different dimensions. Each cell in the process cube corresponds to a set of events and can be used to discover a process model, to check conformance with respect to some process model, or to discover bottlenecks. The idea is related to the well-known OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) data cubes and associated operations such as slice, dice, roll-up, and drill-down. However, there are also significant differences because of the process-related nature of event data. For example, process discovery based on events is incomparable to computing the average or sum over a set of numerical values. Moreover, dimensions related to process instances (e.g. cases are split into gold and silver customers), subprocesses (e.g. acquisition versus delivery), organizational entities (e.g. backoffice versus frontoffice), and time (e.g., 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013) are semantically different and it is challenging to slice, dice, roll-up, and drill-down process mining results efficiently. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",Big Data; Conformance Checking; OLAP; Process Discovery; Process Mining,Administrative data processing; Data handling; Data mining; Drills; Enterprise resource management; Geometry; Conformance checking; Numerical values; OLAP; OLAP (online analytical processing); Process Discovery; Process instances; Process mining; Process Modeling; Big data,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029702838

Old human detection algorithms, based on background and foreground modelling, could not even deal with a group of people, to say nothing of a crowd. Recent robust and highly effective pedestrian detection algorithms are a new milestone of video surveillance systems. Based on modern approaches in deep learning, these algorithms produce very discriminative features that can be used for getting robust inference in real visual scenes. They deal with such tasks as distinguishing different persons in a group, overcome problem with sufficient enclosures of human bodies by the foreground, detect various poses of people. In our work we use a new approach which enables to combine detection and classification tasks into one challenge using convolution neural networks. As a start point we choose YOLO CNN, whose authors propose a very efficient way of combining mentioned above tasks by learning a single neural network. This approach showed competitive results with state-of-the-art models such as FAST R-CNN, significantly overcoming them in speed, which allows us to apply it in real time video surveillance and other video monitoring systems. Despite all advantages it suffers from some known drawbacks, related to the fully-connected layers that obstruct applying the CNN to images with different resolution. Also it limits the ability to distinguish small close human figures in groups which is crucial for our tasks since we work with rather low quality images which often include dense small groups of people. In this work we gradually change network architecture to overcome mentioned above problems, train it on a complex pedestrian dataset and finally get the CNN detecting small pedestrians in real scenes. © 2017 SPIE.",Convolutional neural networks; Human detection; Object classification; Pedestrian detection; Video surveillance,Computer vision; Convolution; Image segmentation; Inference engines; Monitoring; Network architecture; Neural networks; Real time systems; Signal detection; Convolutional neural network; Human detection; Object classification; Pedestrian detection; Video surveillance; Security systems,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029622339

The main focus is studying problems which hamper the increase of trust between the population and small / medium business, the latter being the main means capable of insuring economic growth given the conditions when the raw materials export model of our economic development has been completely exhausted. Analysis is based upon the data from the ""Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of HSE"" (RLMS-HSE). The study revealed that, despite there being significant positive shifts in the last ten years, the level of the public's trust towards private enterprises still remains quite low, while their employees display less trust towards their management compared to those who are employed in the state sector. Lack of trust is becoming one of the reasons for a low level of entrepreneurial activity among Russians, retaining social tension in our society, as well as hostile relations between the rich and the poor. The economic crisis, which has a negative effect on citizens' everyday life, as well as their attitudes, views and values, worsens the situation, while creating additional barriers which hamper the fortification of trust between business and the population. Dissatisfaction with the course of reforms, while being concerned with social inequality and their own state of poverty, causes citizens to stay inclined towards considering that the government should assume the main role in implementing a socially oriented economic policy. At the same time the government is not able to negotiate the population's and business' interests in a manner which is painless for all those involved in interaction. Business' development is hampered by a lack of effective instruments for supporting entrepreneurship on behalf of the government, as well as frequent changes in the conditions of economic activity and restricted access to various resources. While enduring massive pressure on behalf of government officials, law enforcement and corrupt officials, business is inclined to isolate itself from society. One effective, if not particularly popular in Russia, way of increasing trust between the population and business appears to be the development of social enterprises.

In the theoretical part the authors draw distinctions between the NP and SP, using constructivist methodology and elaborating the difference in how NP and SP treat the 'Other'. Three issues are identified. Firstly, SP is an instrument of foreign policy, of conscious manipulation of the 'Other' whereas NP embodies discursive identity practices, which cannot be used instrumentally; its goal is to spread the norms. Secondly, SP maintains the difference between the agent and the recipient whereas NP presupposes that this distance will be overcome, that the NP will eventually incorporate the 'Other'. In order to do so, both territorial and temporal criteria can be used. Finally, the decline of the NP is linked to its success, more specifically, to the constant reassessment of the norms and to the enlargement of its agents as a result of the incorporation of the 'Other'. In other words, the decline of NP is due to the 'Other', to the recipient, whereas the decline of SP is the result of the activities of its agent mainly. The empirical part of the article traces key milestones in the development of the EU's NP as well as its current difficulties: these are a new round of reassessment of the values and increase in the number of agents of the NP Europe as a result of the EU's enlargements in this century. The authors also examine the dialectics of EU-Russian relations through the prism of the difference between NP and SP. It is demonstrated that Brussels has evolved in these relations from the NP in the beginning of the 1990s to the SP in present. Moscow, for its part, has moved from the role of the recipient of the EU's NP to the demands to be accepted as an agent of the NP. It is demonstrated that this inclusion has happened for Russia but not for the EU, which leads to harsh discussions. Finally, the authors analyse the reasons of Russia's inability to form its NP: these are its emphasis on the de-ideologised relations, instrumentalisation of all resources as well as its being in the ideational and normative space of Europe. All these aspects allow Russia to successfully apply its SP but they also create barriers for its NP where Russia would be a key agent. In today's world, however, NP is an essential element for an international actor to be recognised as a centre of power.",Constructivism; European Union; Identity; Inclusivity; Normative power; Russia; Soft power; Temporality; The Other,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028335797

The paper attempts to determine semantic classes of verbs characterized by this type of semantic structure, as well as identify the shifts in interpretation, which occur in each of the two possible morphosyntatic realizations. The study demonstrates that double semantic roles and the ensuing morphosyntactic variation are typical primarily of caused motion verbs of semantically liminal classes, which combine the semantics of caused motion with other components, such as placement, deformation, creation of an image. There are certain semantic peculiarities typical of each of the realizations. For example, the role of place calls for nouns with the meaning of spaces or large surfaces, but not containers; the role of endpoint calls for containers or small surfaces. Intentional actions are better combined with the expression of endpoint; unintentional predicates favor the expression of place. On the whole, double roles are considerably more frequent in direct senses than in metaphorical ones, possibly because greater semantic fuzziness typical for the former is replaced by higher semantic specificity in the latter, which limits the syntactic expression as well.",Accusative case; Actant; Cause; Endpoint; Goal; Metaphor; Morphosyntactic variation; Place; Polysemous; Polysemy; Prepositional case; Semantic role; Syncretism; Valency,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85024866319

In our work, we have investigated performance of a superconducting nanowire photon-counting detector operating in the coherent mode for detection of weak signals at the telecommunication wavelength. Quantum-noise limited sensitivity of the detector was ensured by the nature of the photon-counting detection and restricted by the quantum efficiency of the detector only. Spectral resolution given by the heterodyne technique and was defined by the linewidth and stability of the Local Oscillator (LO). Response bandwidth was found to coincide with the detector's pulse width, which, in turn, could be controlled by the nanowire length. In addition, the system noise bandwidth was shown to be governed by the electronics/lab equipment, and the detector noise bandwidth is predicted to depend on its jitter. As have been demonstrated, a very small amount of the LO power (of the order of a few picowatts down to hundreds of femtowatts) was required for sufficient detection of the test signal, and eventual optimization could lead to further reduction of the LO power required, which would perfectly suit for the foreseen development of receiver matrices and the need for detection of ultra-low signals at a level of less-than-one-photon per second. © 2017 SPIE.",Detectors; Heterodyne detection; Infrared; Photon counting,Bandwidth; Chemical detection; Detectors; Heterodyne detection; Heterodyning; Infrared radiation; Nanowires; Particle beams; Photons; Signal receivers; Spectral resolution; Heterodyne technique; High spectral resolution; Limited sensitivity; Photon counting; Photon counting detectors; Superconducting nanowire; Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors; Telecommunication wavelengths; Signal detection,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022342061

In order to assess the Impact of pro-natalist policies upon the TFR dynamics let us calculate an estimate what the TFR In 2015 would be if there were no such policies. The annual Increase of TFR for second and higher-order births in 2000-2004 was about 0.02. If this Increase had persisted in 2007-2015, the TFR for second and higher-order births In 2015 would have equalled 0.731, while in reality it was 0.990, or 35.4% higher. The TFR for all births would have been in this case 1.518, while in reality It was 1.777, or 17.1% higher. We can take these figures as estimates of the effect of the pro-natalist policies reaped in 2007-2015. Notably, the Increase is observed not only In TFR, but In fertility rates of real cohorts of women as well.",Birth order; Demographic policy; Fertility; Fertility in real cohorts; Maternity capital; Medium age of the mother; Pro-natalist policy; Support for families with children,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020706962

A qualitative analysis of 25 small biotechnology R&D firms listed on a stock exchange illustrates that these firms do not follow the neo-classical expectation of Gaussian returns. To better understand this deviation from the expected Gaussian returns, the firms are compared to S&P 100 and the Thomson Reuters Global Innovator List. It is found that while these large firms have a higher than expected frequency of non-Gaussian events, the causes appear to be dominated by macro-economic or industrial events that impact a large number of firms. With the small R&D-intensive biotechnology firms, it is possible to identify specific events that appear to trigger a sudden increase or decrease in value. A better understanding of the nature and magnitude of these events allows policy makers, investors and managers to better comprehend the unusually large risks and new opportunities associated with biotechnology R&D.

These results allow economists to bypass the limits of the standard model of homo oeconomicus, which has been subject to critiques of many social scientists (including economists), who rightly argued that its view of human cognition and decision capabilities has been exceedingly restricted and narrow. The author surveys and describes key ingredients of a newly emerging model of economic agent - homo postoeconomicus, who extends the neoclassical model of rational action to account for prosocial preferences, cognitive constraints, as well as neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making. In sum, this new model has its advantages over the conventional homo oeconomicus, but also is not free of substantive drawbacks, which so far has failed to contribute to genuine advancement of our knowledge about the nature and causes of human action.",Behavioral economics; Experiments; Neuroeconomics; Prosocial preferences; Rationality,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019942411

In classical political economy this assumption didn't play the key role separating the scope of economic science - this role was performed by the assumption of self-interest. The rationality assumption became important as a result of the Marginal revolution and began to be an object of special research only in the context of expected utility maximization hypothesis of von Neuman and Morgenstern. These developments made it remote from everyday human behavior. In order to make economics a bit more realistic various strategies are used which are briefly surveyed. Within the constant rationality approach we could choose a model of a representative agent characterized by full or bounded rationality. Within the variable rationality approach an additional economic agent may be introduced who will be responsible for observed deviations from rational behaviour, while all the other agents could be described by the familiar rational model. The second variant consists in splitting the economic agent into different subpersonalities, having different, and moreover, conflicting goals. Still another option is to make rationality not only variable but also continuous. In this case it is possible to reach the optimal rationality which differs from the maximum one.",Behavioral economics; Classical political economy; Marginal revolution; Model of man; Rationality,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019858030

For each option of government regulation we conduct an empirical estimation of the influence that this exact option could have on the stability of banking system, taking into account the imperfection of competition on credit market. Special attention was paid on the estimation of thresholds that could separate positive and negative influence of each regulating option on system stability. Estimates were made on the basis of panel dataset covering balance sheets and profit and loss accounts of all Russian banks that disclosed these data through the Bank of Russia's web-site during 2004 Q1-2012 Q4, i.e. before the change of the Head of the Bank of Russia. Our estimations have shown that in order to support stability of banking system during the period analyzed (in-sample) and in 2013-2016 (out-of-sample, in case no internal or external shocks heat the economy) the Russian government, the Bank of Russia and the Deposit Insurance Agency could - taking the levels of banks' market power and credit risk distribution as exogenous - first of all increase the government investments in capital of state-owned banks. Second, they could raise the minimal capital requirements on already operating banks (on RUB 50-100 ml annually during 2013-2016).

Method: The participants were monolingual Australian English- speaking children. The SLI group included 13 participants (mean age = 5;7 [years;months]); the control group included 19 children with typical development (mean age = 5;4). Both groups performed a grammaticality judgment and elicited production task with the same set of nonce verbs in third-person singular and past tense forms. Results: Five-year-old children are still learning to generalize morphophonological patterns to novel verbs, and syllabic /əz/ and /əd/ allomorphs are significantly more challenging to produce, particularly for the SLI group. The greater phonetic content of these syllabic forms did not enhance perception. Conclusions: Acquisition of morphophonological patterns involving low-frequency allomorphs is still underway in 5-year-old children with typical development, and it is even more protracted in SLI populations, despite these patterns being highly predictable. Children with SLI will therefore benefit from targeted intervention with low-frequency allomorphs. © 2017 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.",,"child; decision making; developmental language disorder; female; human; language development; language test; learning; linguistics; male; preschool child; speech perception; Child; Child Language; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Judgment; Language Development Disorders; Language Tests; Learning; Linguistics; Male; Speech Perception",English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019742398

Extracting all elements faster is impossible as this would violate the Ω(n log n) bound for comparison-based sorting. It is known, however, that is takes only O(n + k log k) time to sort just k smallest elements out of n given, which prompts that there might be a faster heap, whose extract-min performance depends on the number of elements extracted so far. In this paper we show that is indeed the case.

The question arises as to how stable beliefs influence such evaluations. In this study we have analyzed the link between such beliefs and readiness to participate in political actions. We assumed that just and dangerous world beliefs are factors that influence readiness to participate in political actions. However, these factors’ influence is mediated by political efficacy. Respondents from Russia (N = 440) and Ukraine (N = 249) participated in our study. Structural equation modeling partly confirmed the hypotheses. It has shown that the more people believe in a just world and the less they believe in a dangerous world, the higher their internal and external political efficacy is. Political efficacy, in turn, predicts readiness to participate in various forms of political action. Internal political efficacy is positively linked to normative political collective actions, while external political efficacy is negatively linked to nonnormative collective actions.

It is shown that feelings of shrinking social opportunities impact considerably dynamics and venues for elderly people adaptation to crisis situation. Deteriorating living conditions of pensioners often lead them to save, rather than activate effective coping mechanisms. Such saving strategy helps to survive, but does not improve/maintain usual standard of living. A decrease in the level of material and social claims, interest for quality aspects of life, as well as inert thinking hampers the adaptation process to everyday living conditions for elderly folk, drastically restricting the scope of action for effective adaptation mechanisms.

First, I compare classical evolutionary conceptions of morality by C. Darwin and H. Spencer, emphasizing that evolutionary perspective in the sociology of morality is not something absolutely new but, rather, it once belonged to the core ideas of the discipline. After that, I review the key new-Darwinian models of explanations of moral behavior which are related to a number of different approaches, such as theories of kin and group selection, reciprocal altruism and cooperation, evolutionary psychology and theory of cultural evolution. I argue that modern evolutionary disciplines reached considerable success in studying moral phenomena, so that sociology of morality needs to incorporate these theoretical models in order to provide a fuller understanding of morality. In this context, I review J. Turner's conception of ""evolutionary sociology"" as an attempt of sociological reception of the modern evolutionary synthesis in behavioral sciences. While Turner is given credit for drawing sociologists' attention to modern evolutionary conceptions of morality, I also criticize his approach for over-emphasizing the historical perspective of the hominid evolution and lack of elaboration of this conceptions to the studies of morality in modern societies; at the same time I argue that classical sociology of morality still has large theoretical resources which can be integrated with modern evolutionary perspective, so that moral phenomena would receive a more rigorous scientific explanation.",Altruism; Evolutionary theory; Moral norms; Morality; Sociology of morality,,Russian,Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015877331

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the author’s 25 years of experience designing, running, and studying Canadian Government CI programs, a classification scheme to classify these programs has been developed and used. Also, by using program review information, this paper looks at evidence for program impact on regional and sectoral economic development. Findings: This paper identifies a broad range of federal and provincially sponsored CI programs aimed at helping both government officers and those outside the department make better decisions. The review identified several roles that the government can play in using CI: creator of CI (both for their own purposes and also for helping Canadian companies), CI environment skills builder (helping Canadian companies develop skills in developing their own CI) and CI partner (working jointly with Canadian companies in developing CI). While there have not been many formal program reviews of the CI programs sponsored by Canadian Government departments and agencies, anecdotal evidence (from training program participant evaluations) and a comprehensive review of a small community CI-based economic development program support positive sectoral and regional economic development results arising from these programs. Practical implications: CI programs can be used as part of a government’s regional and sectoral economic development approach. CI can be used to assist with decision-making both within and outside the government. This paper identifies several different kinds of programs that can be used to further a government’s economic development agenda. Originality/value: There are very few articles that examine how governments have helped companies to develop CI and how they have used CI, and none has looked at the impact of these on regional and sectoral economic development.

The median-based central consensus rule we introduce in this paper allows one to select an optimal value of the Minkowski exponent. Our rule takes into account the values of the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) between clustering solutions obtained for different Minkowski exponents and selects the clustering that provides the highest average value of ARI.

The orbits of the Earth and Mars are necessary to be circular and noncoplanar. The SC starts from the artificial Earth satellite circular orbit (AESCO) and finishes at the artificial Mars satellite circular orbit (AMSCO). The SC position on an initial AESCO at the starting point and position on an AMSCO at the finish are optimized. Acceleration of the SC near the Earth and braking near Mars, that are carried out by jet engines of big thrust, are approximated by pulse excitations. On the rest of the trajectory the control of the SC is realized by a low thrust jet engine vector. In connection with the taking into account the loss of accuracy effect, the inertial heliocentric and the noninertial rotating marsand geocentric reference frames are used at the solution creation. Total flight time is minimized. The considered problem is formalized as a variable structure dynamic system optimal control problem. On the basis of the Pontryagins maximum principle its solving is reduced to the 42nd order boundary value problem solving. The boundary value problem is solved numerically by a shooting method with selection of 13 parameters. The vector function root is found with the use of Newton's method with Isaev-Sonin's modification and Fedorenko's normalization in the convergence conditions. The Cauchy problems of shooting method are solved numerically by the explicit 8th order Runge-Kutta's method based on Dormand-Prince's 8(7) calculating formula with the automatic step choice. Main result: The original problem has been solved. Pontryagin's extremals are defined out as a boundary value problem solution result. The analysis depending on problem parameters is carried out. Various AMSCO were considered during calculating. Particularly we succeed constructed Pontryagin's extremals in problems of transition to AMSCO which are close approximates Phobos and Deimos orbits without pulse influences at the finish moment. The SC performs a sixty-six and a nineteen many-revolution brakings near Mars respectively at these constructed trajectories on the final part of flight. The parameters continuation of the planar case of problem solution is used to construct trajectories in the major case. Using of high and low thrust propulsion in combination for space missions allows increase the useful weight and makes the project cheaper, that is actual now.

The authors come to the conclusion that after the beginning of the Arab Spring, explosive global growth was observed for the overwhelming majority of indicators of socio-political destabilization - for anti-government demonstrations, riots, general strikes, terrorist acts / guerrilla warfare and purges. It was also observed for the global integral index of socio-political destabilization. On the other hand, no statistically significant growth was observed for assassinations and political crises. On the other hand, for such an important indicator of global socio-political destabilization, as a global number of coups and coup attempts, there was a statistically significant decrease. In 2011, the number of major anti-government demonstrations in the world increased in a particularly dramatic way (11.5 times, that is, more than by an order of magnitude). At the same time, there was a noticeably less intensive (approximately 6-fold) increase in the global number of riots, while the number of major terrorist attacks in this year only doubled. The global number of major anti-government demonstrations in 2012-2013 slightly decreased, while the global intensity of riots continued to grow, coming close to the intensity of anti-government demonstrations. The global number of major terrorist attacks in 2011-2014 grew exponentially, exceeding in 2014 the number of both major anti-government demonstrations and riots.

The authors assume that if external forces procure economic resources and political bonuses for a transition state in the absence of mechanisms for their efficient distribution, such a state is vulnerable for destabilization. To evaluate the resources application efficiency, the authors formulate a range of economic and political criteria based on the post-war Greek history. They show that its consumption-driven economic growth, weak manufacturing sector, and irrational distribution of finances received from abroad have resulted in the Greek inability to overcome the crisis without external support. The authors pay a particular attention to the fact that Greece was accepted into the EEC and NATO for strategic reasons while democratic and market reforms stalled. The revealed patterns are relevant for analyzing the situation not only in Greece, but also in another Balkan country - Montenegro, which is comparable to Greece in a number of aspects.

However, some evidences of this custom can be traced for many centuries before.

For the past twenty years, however, scholars under the umbrella of the Johns Hopkins Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project have worked with statisticians to assemble the first comprehensive, empirical picture of the size, structure, financing, and role of this increasingly important part of modern life. What accounts for the enormous cross-national variations in the size and contours of the civil society sector around the world? Drawing on the project's data, Lester M. Salamon, S. Wojciech Sokolowski, Megan A. Haddock, and their colleagues raise serious questions about the ability of the field's currently dominant preference and sentiment theories to account for these variations in civil society development. Instead, using statistical and comparative historical materials, the authors posit a novel social origins theory that roots the variations in civil society strength and composition in the relative power of different social groupings and institutions during the transition to modernity. Drawing on the work of Barrington Moore, Dietrich Rueschemeyer, and others, Explaining Civil Society Development provides insight into the nonprofit sector's ability to thrive and perform its distinctive roles. Combining solid data and analytical clarity, this pioneering volume offers a critically needed lens for viewing the evolution of civil society and the nonprofit sector throughout the world. © 2017 Lester M.

It argues that the information-gathering and co-optation functions of elections help sustain authoritarian rule, whereas insufficient co-optation and failure to signal regime strength may lead to anti-regime mobilization and weaken the regime.

Agents' workspace is tessellated into the square grid on which anyangle moves are allowed, e.g. each agent can move into an arbitrary direction as long as this move follows the straight line segment whose endpoints are tied to the distinct grid elements. A novel any-angle planner based on Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP) algorithm is proposed to find trajectories for an agent moving amidst dynamic obstacles (other agents) on a grid. This algorithm is then used as part of a prioritized multi-agent planner AA-SIPP(m). On the theoretical side, we show that AA-SIPP(m) is complete under well-defined conditions.

In part, its importance is related to the fact that it makes various parameters of mathematical objects computationally accessible. Tropical polynomials play an important role in this, especially for the case of algebraic geometry. On the other hand, many algebraic questions behind tropical polynomials remain open. In this paper we address three basic questions on tropical polynomials closely related to their computational properties: 1.Given a polynomial with a certain support (set of monomials) and a (finite) set of inputs, when is it possible for the polynomial to vanish on all these inputs?2.A more precise question, given a polynomial with a certain support and a (finite) set of inputs, how many roots can polynomial have on this set of inputs?3.Given an integer k, for which s there is a set of s inputs such that any non-zero polynomial with at most k monomials has a non-root among these inputs? In the classical algebra well-known results in the direction of these questions are Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, Schwartz-Zippel Lemma and Universal Testing Set for sparse polynomials respectively. In this paper we extensively study these three questions for tropical polynomials and provide results analogous to the classical results mentioned above. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany 2017.",,Algebra; Combinatorial optimization; Computation theory; Geometry; Polynomials; Tropics; Algebraic geometry; Combinatorial nullstellensatz; Computational properties; Fewnomials; Mathematical objects; Mathematical physics; Sparse polynomials; Tropical algebras; Combinatorial mathematics,English,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029459398

Basing on input semantic structures, the agent changes its emotional state over time, generating expressive remarks along with gestures. The reactions subsystem operates with emotional criteria and matches the input semantic representation to scenarios from its database, consequently, it selects relevant reactions from a set of multimodal templates.

Owing to a number of potential application areas of nanotechnologies within this sector, the purpose of this study is to take defense as a case and propose a strategic roadmap for the use of nanotechnologies in the Turkish Defense Industry. Design/methodology/approach: The study presented in this paper uses a bibliometric analysis of the most cited publications in the past decade with the aim of identifying the trends in the development of nanotechnology. Interviews were carried out with experts based on the featured words of bibliometric analysis (nanoparticles, nanostructure, self-assembly, drug delivery, graphene, etc.) to reveal the commercialization time of nanotechnology products and applications. After that, a survey was carried out with engineers for determining the possible emergence time of nanotechnology applications and/or products used in military up to year 2035. Finally, a roadmap was created based on the obtained data from bibliometric analysis, interviews and survey results. Findings: Nanotechnology roadmap was prepared, one which would contribute to the preparation of the defense industry for the future and help in keeping up with technological developments. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Interviews and surveys have limitation with the bounded rationality of corresponders. Practical implications: The paper proposed a nanotechnology roadmap for the defense sector with a data-led foresight practice. Originality/value: Performing such a study is considered to be crucial for the armies of developed and developing countries, so that the military sector also avails benefits from this revolutionary technology.

WSI is the task of automatically inducing the different senses of a given word in the form of an unsupervised learning task with senses represented as clusters of token instances. In this paper, we compared four WSI techniques: Adaptive Skip-gram (AdaGram), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), clustering of contexts and clustering of synonyms. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated them and performed a deep study of the AdaGram method comparing AdaGram clusters for 126 words (nouns, adjectives, and verbs) and their senses in published dictionaries. We found out that AdaGram is quite good at distinguishing homonyms and metaphoric meanings. It ignores disappearing and obsolete senses, but induces new and domain-specific senses which are sometimes absent in dictionaries. However it works better for nouns than for verbs, ignoring the structural differences (e.g. causative meanings or different government patterns).

Traditionally described as expressing the falsity of a proposition contained in somebody's utterance, in conjunction with a negative assessment of the utterer as aware of its falsity, jakoby displays very different usages in the language of contemporary mass media. Namely, it is frequently used as a mere marker of evidentiality, without an obligatory assessment of the proposition as false or of its source as untruthful. In fact, it can even be used to refer to statements that are treated as true within the very same text, only to indicate that the source of this information is not the writer herself but somebody else (e.g., a different news agency), in what might be termed as ""safety"" strategy. Besides, jakoby in its mass media usages demonstrates unusual syntactic behaviors, namely shifts in scope, where it is placed before the speech verb rather than before the challenged proposition: jakoby utverzhdat', chto P 'jakoby claim that P' instead of utverzhdat', chto jakoby P 'claim that jakoby P'. However, the study of the Russian-English parallel corpus reveals that these usages are not as unusual as they may appear. In Russian translations of English texts jakoby sometimes functions as a translation of the English supposedly, allegedly, ostensibly or other (e.g., verbal) markers of uncertainty, but more frequently occurs with no apparent stimulus in the source, merely to mark indirect quotation. It appears therefore that there is a certain need in the Russian language for a neutral evidentiality marker. It is occasionally filled with jakoby, which in this case displays a tendency for grammaticalization: it expresses that the source of information is other than the speaker herself (but contains no other semantic components), and takes syntactic scope over the speech verb instead of the proposition it challenges.","""Xeno"" marker; De dicto; De re; Evidentiality; Proposition; Safety"" discourse strategy; Semantic scope; Syntactic scope",,Russian,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021776600

However, less attention has been devoted to the role of the social cognitive capital of the national population. Does society's cognitive capital matter in governmental choice regarding environmental policies, if at all? This study addresses this question through a large-N analysis of 94 countries accounting for the role of both political regimes and social capital in governmental choice of climate change policies. We find that higher social cognitive capital within a democratic state radically increases that state's commitment to adopt environmental policies. More specifically, a 1-point increase in the democracy index is associated with nearly 5 points increase in the adoption of the Climate Laws, Institutions and Measures Index (CLIMI).

When a nontarget image is selected, comprehension failure is assumed. However, stimulus-driven factors unrelated to linguistic comprehension may influence performance. In this study we explore the influence of physical image characteristics of multiple-choice image displays on visual attention allocation by PWA. Method: Eye fixations of 41 PWA were recorded while they viewed 40 multiple-choice image sets presented with and without verbal stimuli. Within each display, 3 images (majority images) were the same and 1 (singleton image) differed in terms of 1 image characteristic. The mean proportion of fixation duration (PFD) allocated across majority images was compared against the PFD allocated to singleton images. Results: PWA allocated significantly greater PFD to the singleton than to the majority images in both nonverbal and verbal conditions. Those with greater severity of comprehension deficits allocated greater PFD to nontarget singleton images in the verbal condition. Conclusion: When using tasks that rely on multiple-choice displays and verbal stimuli, one cannot assume that verbal stimuli will override the effect of visual-stimulus characteristics. © 2017 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.",,adolescent; adult; aged; aphasia; attention; comprehension; female; human; language test; male; middle aged; photostimulation; psychology; speech perception; vision; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aphasia; Attention; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Language Tests; Male; Middle Aged; Photic Stimulation; Speech Perception; Visual Perception; Young Adult,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019762206

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this goal, best international practice was analyzed that provided a solid basis for Russian S&T Foresight 2030 (section “Nanotechnology and new materials”). The study used a wide range of advanced Foresight methods adapted to Russian circumstances. During the Foresight study, the authors integrated “market pull” and research “technology push” approaches including both traditional methods (priority-setting, roadmaps, global challenges analysis) and relatively new approaches (horizon scanning, weak signals, wild cards, etc.). Findings: Using the methods of the Foresight, the authors identified trends with the greatest impact on the sphere of nanotechnology and new materials, promising markets, product groups and potential areas of demand for Russian innovation technologies and developments in this field. The authors assessed the state-of-the-art of the domestic research in the area of nanotechnologies and new materials to identify “white spots”, as well as parity zone and leadership, which can be the basis for integration into international alliances and positioning of Russia as a center of global technological development in this field. Originality/value: The results of applying Foresight methodology toward revelation of the most prospective S&T areas in the field of nanotechnologies and new materials can be used by a variety of stakeholders including federal and regional authorities, technology platforms and innovation and industrial clusters, leading universities and scientific organizations in formulation of their research and strategic agenda.

The examination of the samples by thermodesorption mass spectrometry showed that high-energy irradiation resulted also in loosening of the surface layer and considerable expansion of high-potential adsorption sites, which was the reason for the observed peak desorption of gases. The existence of desorption peaks allowed us to calculate the activation energy of surface desorption of gas components.

In the present study, we explored whether these three specific visual phenomena share any commonalities in their alternation rates and patterns to better understand the mechanisms of each. Data from 69 individuals revealed moderate to strong correlations across the three phenomena for the number of perceptual disappearances and the accumulated duration of the disappearances. Importantly, these effects were not correlated with eye movement patterns (saccades) assessed through eye tracking, differences in motion sensitivity as indexed by dot coherence and speed perception thresholds, or simple reaction time abilities. Principal component analyses revealed a single component that explained 67% of the variance for the number of perceptual reversals and 60% for the accumulated duration of the disappearances.

For any task loss, we construct a convex surrogate that can be optimized via stochastic gradient descent and we prove tight bounds on the so-called ""calibration function"" relating the excess surrogate risk to the actual risk. In contrast to prior related work, we carefully monitor the effect of the exponential number of classes in the learning guarantees as well as on the optimization complexity. As an interesting consequence, we formalize the intuition that some task losses make learning harder than others, and that the classical 0-1 loss is ill-suited for structured prediction. © 2017 Neural information processing systems foundation.

Conventional political volunteering and unconventional political activism are both means for inclusion, participation, accountability, and change (sometimes even democratization) of polities. Both conventional political volunteering and protest activism rely on commitment, values, solidarities, and often altruism, as ordinary citizens seek solutions to collective problems/issues. © David Horton Smith, Robert A.

Members usually believe that participatory and egalitarian practices are more likely to foster desired outcomes and empower members.

LGAs have also been termed the dark matter of the nonprofit sector (Smith 1997c), and as below the radar organizations (Soteri-Proctor 2011), because they are often overlooked and are difficult to find, sample, and study. LGAs, the oldest type of NPOs and dating from 10,000 years ago (Smith 1997b; see also Handbook Chapter 1), have been found in every contemporary society and in all earlier societies, properly studied, seeking a very wide variety of goals. They are discussed here in terms of their life cycles, purposive and analytical types, external linkages, internal structures and processes, leadership and management, prestige and power, and impacts. There is strong evidence that LGAs are growing in global prevalence, based on broader, ongoing processes such as population growth, increasing formal education, economic development, civil liberties, and other long-term global trends (Schofer and Longhofer 2011; Smith and Shen 2002). © David Horton Smith, Robert A.

A fairly stable core of these perceptions depends on individual characteristics of these stakeholders. Three failures of NPOs threaten perceptions of MAs: (1) amateurism, (2) over-exclusion, and (3) asymmetry of information - lack of transparency, the potential for fraud, and violations of the non-distribution constraint in NPOs. MAs and other NPOs can influence perceptions by changing their behavior in interactions with stakeholders and in their communication strategies.

Unless otherwise stated, nonprofits are here taken to include the full range from volunteer-run/volunteer-led, small grassroots associations through to very large, paid-staff-dominated nonprofit agencies (cf. Smith 2015a, 2015b). Handbook Chapters 38, 40-44, and 46-50 consider major input and process issues of membership associations operating in the nonprofit sector, with some attention also to volunteer service programs as departments of larger, parent organizations (cf. Handbook Chaxspters 15 and 16). All are challenging, but resource attraction and maintenance are particularly crucial issues, given the intense competition for resources among associations, as for all nonprofits. This chapter looks at resource attraction through a marketing theory lens. The resources of nonprofits are finance, people (paid, partially paid, and voluntary/unpaid), physicals (buildings, plant, etc.), and reputation/brand. For most nonprofits, the first three resources are in short supply, and the last one is ambiguous in its meaning to different stakeholders and is costly and time consuming to manage. © David Horton Smith, Robert A.

In the E. V. Besschetnova's article Order No 1 and Army Collapse: at the Origins of the October 1917 is argued the thought that because the army-institute is a prefigure of discipline and order and also a main guarantee of the state's stability, the famous ""Order No 1"" became the point of no return for army, society and state of Russia in 1917. In the V. K. Kantor's article Revolution, or Entry into the Age of Insanity is shown that revolutionary movements were almost always determined by the factor of insanity. The author believes that without taking this factor into account it is impossible to understand many historical phenomena, especially radical ones. In the O. A. Zhukova's article Evgeny Trubetskoy as a Philosopher of History: on the Meaning of Russian Revolution is shown that Evgeny Trubetskoy raised the question about the meaning of war and the causes of the Russian revolution, continuing the line of reasoning about the specifics of the national history and the spiritual crisis of the Christian civilization, which was developed by European and Russian thinkers in the last third of the XIX century. M. S. Kiseleva in the article Intellectuals and the First Russian Revolution of 1917: N. Berdyaev and M. Gorky analyzes the remarks published by N. Berdyaev and M. Gorky in periodicals to events from March to June 1917: about the origins of the First World War; about the reason of the collapse of the Russian autocracy; about tasks for the further development of revolutionary events. The analysis of their positions allows the author to emphasize the ideological differences and similarities of representatives of the Russian ""intelligentsia"" in their attitude to the revolutional events of the 1917. A. A. Kara-Murza in the article 'History' and 'Historical Accident' in the Social Concept of Russian Bolshevism by V. I. Talin focuses his attention on the works of S. O. Portugeys (1880-1944, ""V. I. Talin"" is a literary pseudonym) - a politician and publicist of the moderate wing of Russian Socialism, sometimes referred to as ""the first Sovietologist of emigration"". The author shows that unlike the works of most intellectuals who found themselves in emigration, the works of V. I. Talin are based on rich sociological materials. In the 1920-s it had allowed Talin to formulate the main regularities of the evolution of the Bolshevik regime and assume that, rather than external intervention, its ""gravediggers"" over time will be the ""new social strata"", engendered by Bolshevism itself and associated with the regeneration of culture within the USSR. In the article Revolution and the Sovereign Dictatorship A. F. Filippov argues that the works of the theorists and practitioners of the ""dictatorship of the proletariat"" in Russia can be viewed not only from the point of view of political history, but also in the context of the history of political philosophy. In Lenin's The State and Revolution and in his polemics with Kautsky, the main points are traditional questions of the constitution of the social order, the concepts of the people and sovereignty. Lenin inherits not only Marx, but also Hobbes, Spinoza, Rousseau. Among his contemporaries this was well understood by Carl Schmitt. In the polemical article by T. G. Shchedrina and B. I. Pruzhinin Philosopher in the Revolution: the 'Consolation' of Philosophy is provided the thought that historical event as a whole phenomenon of historical memory is always a product of reconstructions which through the point of view of contemporary ideological trends determine its time frames and sign-symbolic structure of its elements. The event of the 1917 during past hundred years not less than 10 times changed its outlines and meaning. According to the authors the issue of philosophy is not to be dissolved in dominant ideological trends ""decorating"" historical events with religious sentences or emotional metaphors but to critically analyze historically changing conceptual constructs with the help of which humanitarians of various epochs differently marked the ""meaning"" of politically colored historical episodes. As an example of ideological and philosophical approaches to the interpretation of historical event the works of G. Shpet and D. M. Coygen written in the end of 1917 and in 1918 are compared.",Army; Autocracy; Bolshevism; Concept of the political; Culture; Dictatorship; Emigration; Historical process; Monarchy; Philosophy of history; Reconstruction; Revolution; Sovereignty; World War I,,Russian,Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037060096

The paper presents a quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the use of different communication channels and of the use of multi-channel communication strategies. In doing so, it introduces the concept of ""communicative result"" as the criteria for measuring efficiency. It further compares the technical parameters of different channels in terms of their reliability, speed, and effectiveness. It considers the impact of cultural factors on the efficiency of communication channels. It presents a data-driven framework for evaluating and developing efficient government communication channels within specific national, cultural conditions. Using the data collected in Russia, the paper presents how the most widely used government communication channels for voluntary, inter-active communication with business audiences actually work in practice. The empirical research draws from 1,065 individual government uses of specific channels to reach small, medium and large-scale business. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variation (ANOVA) and correlation analysis of channel complementarity and effectiveness. The study also explores the patterns of use of channels by businesses characterized as having different levels of innovation status and as operating with different levels of oversight or regulation by government. Utilizing the overall theoretical framework and the specific information provided from studies in Russia, the paper presents some specific characteristics of the use of communication channels by Russian business, as well as a number of internationally relevant issues. It finds that: (1) Personal contact, either directly or through known intermediary acquaintances is the most efficient means of communicating with Russian business. (2) The smaller the number of steps in the communication chain, the quicker the response achieved. (3) Use of ""mediated contact"" is more important in reaching most types of businesses in Russia that in other countries. (4) Government organizations need to select the proper composition of various communication channels to achieve the most efficient results.

The strategic business model incorporates ecological, social and economic aspects. Design/methodology/approach: Considering Trans-Siberian Railway as a typical case, the study selected several cases or the parts of the primary rail connection with the affiliation of important neighbouring countries. The study uses quantitative analyses of a variety of size parameters (e.g. volumes of traffic, logistics costs, delivery distance and air pollutants). Findings: The empirical findings stress that supply chains should favour in the future railway (or intermodal) connections for piggyback and containerised cargo. Herein lays the reason for the examination of all traditional factors affecting the modal choice and their complementation by the parameters to measure sustainability throughout the supply chains. The inclusion of the green practices positively affected the environmental, social and economic performance of the new approach. Research limitations/implications: This research focuses on the delivery of cargo in containers and semi-trailers within wagons through the overland corridors. Despite the restrictive empirical findings within the national transport system, some elements can be representative of the international supply chains, provided that intermodal services are the most appropriate for the transportation over long distances. Practical implications: Clients, media and regulatory bodies stress the consideration of environmental aspects at all stages of a global supply chain. Therefore, their adoption into strategic imperatives of local supply chains becomes inevitable. Originality/value: An assessment of supply chains for longer distance transportation in Russia has not taken sustainability into account within cost analyses. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Competitiveness; Emerging economies; Environmental impact; Transport operations,,English,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030839814

Two main reasons produce these errors. First, the errors occur on the step corresponding to the measurement, e.g. incorrect calibration and estimation of geometric parameters of the set-up. The second reason is the nature of the tomography reconstruction step. At the stage a mathematical model to calculate the projection data is created. Applied optimization and regularization methods along with their numerical implementations of the method chosen have their own specific errors. Nowadays, a lot of research teams try to analyze these errors and construct the relations between error sources. In this paper, we do not analyze the nature of the final error, but present a new approach for the calculation of its distribution in the reconstructed volume. We hope that the visualization of the error distribution will allow experts to clarify the medical report impression or expert summary given by them after analyzing of CT results.

First, we consider unit-sized packets labeled with an output port and a processing requirement (i.e., packets with heterogeneous processing), maximizing the number of transmitted packets. We analyze the performance of buffer management policies under various characteristics via competitive analysis that provides uniform guarantees across traffic patterns (Borodin and ElYaniv 1998). We propose the Longest-Work-Drop policy and show that it is at most 2-competitive and at least 2-competitive. Second, we consider another generalization, posed as an open problem in Goldwasser (2010), where each unit-sized packet is labeled with an output port and intrinsic value, and the goal is to maximize the total value of transmitted packets. We show first results in this direction and define a scheduling policy that, as we conjecture, may achieve constant competitive ratio.

We start with the premise that more people volunteer within, and on behalf of, religious organizations than in any other organizational setting in the United States and certain other nations. We review the history of religion and religious volunteering, followed by a typology of the various forms of religious volunteering. We discuss how religious associations are formed, distinguishing between local religious congregations and faith-based organizations. Given the importance of local religious congregations, we discuss congregational volunteering, lay-leadership, and member volunteering in these voluntary associations. One section looks at monasteries/convents and communes/intentional communities as residential religious associations. We conclude with new challenges and relevant policies that affect religious volunteering. © David Horton Smith, Robert A. Stebbins, and Jurgen Grotz 2016 and Respective authors 2016.

This chapter reviews research on formal volunteering at three different life stages: youth, elderly, and parental volunteering. In each stage, we discuss the definitions, unique characteristics, and scope of volunteering. We further analyze the existing knowledge on motivations, benefits, challenges, and impact for each age group. Furthermore, we discuss the cultural differences of volunteering in each stage in various regions around the world. We conclude with a comparison between the three groups and discuss future trends. The three life stages examined are more distinct and meaningful in industrial and post-industrial societies than in less complex societies, owing to mass education and longer lifespans. Given wide cultural differences in how individuals progress through these stages, the intersection of life-cycle stage and cultural setting are major variables in understanding patterns of volunteering. © David Horton Smith, Robert A.

Despite significant research done on market entry and internationalisation strategies of firms, the use of collaborative entry modes by SMEs during internationalisation has not received a lot of attention. The authors contribute to foreign market entry studies by analysing the influences of cognitive dimensions on collaborative entry mode choice (equity vs non-equity modes) of SMEs in their international markets. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyse the influences of cognitive dimensions on the choice between equity-based vs non-equity-based collaborative entry modes. The empirical sample consists of internationalisation strategies of 345 Italian SMEs, where the authors used a questionnaire to collect the data. The authors use structural equation modelling to analyse influences of factors like asymmetric information, informal institutional distance, time trends of country, perception of size and resources of potential host country partners, and perception of host country partners’ power on this important market entry mode. Findings: The results show that high informal institutional distance leads to preference of non-equity-based collaborative entry mode by Italian SMEs. The authors also find that positive time trends of the host country, positive perception of size and resource of the local partner, as well as the local partners’ power leads to preference of equity-based collaborative entry mode by Italian SMEs.

Most of fast reconstruction algorithms use the X-ray monochromaticity assumption. If we apply the algorithms to reconstruct the images from the projections measured in polychromatic mode then the reconstructed images will be corrupted by so-called cupping artifacts due to beam hardening. There are several approaches to take into account polichromaticity. One of them is to correct the sinograms before reconstruction.

Such predictors are sometimes referred to as dynamic variables. This chapter reviews research from various nations mainly on such motivational factors as personality traits, values, general and specific attitudes, habits, intentions, and goals/values as influences on FV. Less research is available on other, potentially relevant, psychological factors, such as affects-emotions, intellectual capacities, cognitions-information-perceptions, and the self, let alone on serious pain as a factor affecting volunteering. Yet some, often much, empirical evidence and also relevant theory support the necessity of studying such psychological factors, as well as motivations in understanding FV, partially validating the recent S-Theory of Smith (2014b, 2015a, 2017b). Smith’s (1994) Active-Effective Character (A-EC) Model, now re-named as the Active-Prosocial Character (A-PC) Model, is also supported.

That is why ethical problematics becomes the key element of philosophical work as in our country and also abroad. The participants of the conference set the task to analyze moral alternatives of the modern world conditioned by the ethics orientation on absolute foundations of morality on one hand, and on the other hand by the factual relativity of these norms, that expresses in the detachment of applied ethics from the philosophical ethics. In the center of discussion were problems and difficulties in Russian ethical investigations and the attempts to determine the priorities of their near-future development.

The shifting of intron over short distances (rare evolutionary event called intron sliding) could lead to the change of intron phase, i.e. the intron position relative to the open reading frame. Here we analyze the EIS from four datasets of eukaryotic orthologues in order to find out the preferable choice of intron phase during sliding and to study the correlation between orthologous intron lengths. To identify the orthologous introns we have constructed the alignments of EIS of orthologous genes. Several sliding events with intron phase change were revealed from the analysis; however, our initial hypothesis that in the process of sliding introns prefer to change its phase to 0 more frequently, was not been confirmed. Nevertheless, it is necessary to expand the analysis on a larger dataset for making a proper conclusions. Despite high variability of intron length, some taxonomic groups share the similar length values. Moreover, some length conservation could be observed if instead of intron length L we consider a normalized length N = (L-A)/A, where A is an average length within an orthologous intron group. E.g. for ptprd genes of birds (28 species) the normalized value is in the interval (-0.15, 0.15) for 85.2 % of introns what is significantly higher than the values for random lengths set in accordance with the intron lengths distribution. That length ""conservation"" leads us to the question what intron length was in the ancient introns.",Alignment; Conservation; EIS; Exon-intron structure; Intron; Phase 1; Sliding,,Russian,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032937030

The multistage approach to image processing, described in this paper, comprises main types of cortical multistage convergence. One of these types occurs within each visual pathway and the other between the pathways. This approach maps input images into a flexible hierarchy which reflects the complexity of the image data. The procedures of temporal image decomposition and hierarchy formation are described in mathematical terms. The multistage system highlights spatial regularities, which are passed through a number of transformational levels to generate a coded representation of the image which encapsulates, in a computer manner, structure on different hierarchical levels in the image. At each processing stage a single output result is computed to allow a very quick response from the system.

For instance, Distance Bounding Protocols take into account the round trip time of messages and the transmission velocity to infer an upper bound of the distance between two agents. We classify such security protocols as Cyber-Physical. Time plays a key role in design and analysis of many of these protocols. This paper investigates the foundational differences and the impacts on the analysis when using models with discrete time and models with dense time. We show that there are attacks that can be found by models using dense time, but not when using discrete time. We illustrate this with an attack that can be carried out on most Distance Bounding Protocols. In this attack, one exploits the execution delay of instructions during one clock cycle to convince a verifier that he is in a location different from his actual position. We additionally present a probabilistic analysis of this novel attack. As a formal model for representing and analyzing Cyber-Physical properties, we propose a Multiset Rewriting model with dense time suitable for specifying cyber-physical security protocols.

Since 2012 in the BSA the continuous survey observation was started in multibeam mode in the frequency band of 109–112 MHz. Now 96 beams covering from −8 and up to +42° in declination are used. The number of frequency bands are 6 with a time resolution of 0.1 s and 32 bands with the time resolution of 0.0125 s. In a fast mode (32 bands, 0.0125 s) daily data flow is 87.5 GB (32 TB per year). The data provide a great opportunity for both short-term and long-term monitoring of the various radio sources. The sources are fast radio transients of different nature, such as fast radio bursts (FRB), possible counterparts of gamma-ray bursts (GRB), and sources of gravitational waves, the Earth’s ionosphere, interplanetary and interstellar plasma. Based on the BSA observations the database is constructed. We discuss data base properties, the methods of transient search and allocation in database. Using this database we were able to detect 83096 individual transient events in the period of July 2012 – October 2013, which may correspond to pulsars, scintillating sources and fast radio transients. We also present first results and statistics of transients classification.

Calculation of these projections makes it possible to express the supersymmetric Bethe vectors in terms of the matrix elements of the universal monodromy matrix. Two different presentations for the Bethe vectors are obtained by using two different but isomorphic current realizations of the Yangian double DY (gl(m|n)).

Nowadays all forms of communications connected with scientific activity are transforming, that in its place requires the development of new forms of scientific inner communication (inside-the-discipline and interdisciplinary) and communicative interaction with outer social-cultural environment. Accordingly, the problematics of scientific communications turns out in the focus of philosophical-methodological reflexion on science attention and specially of philosophy of science; the problematics that indeed synthesizes in it all taking place in science changes in the prism of the very actual for modern science task - during the scientific research and social application of its results to surpass the communicative gaps between scientists of different profiles, and also between scientists and engineers, businessmen, officials, politicians, various social groups.

This Handbook is very clearly about associationalism writ large, not about associations and social welfare only (Smith 2015c). The latter issue is one key piece of the total puzzle, but we aim to cover the whole range of association types and time periods. Volunteering seems to be a characteristic of our species, with informal (unorganized) volunteering probably going back to our origins 150,000-200,000 years ago. Formal volunteering in associations can only be traced back about 10,000 years to the origins of associations in which to do such volunteering (Anderson 1971; Bradfield 1973). Volunteering in formal volunteer service programs (VSPs) as departments of other organizations is very recent historically, only going back to the mid-1800s (Smith 2015b; see Handbook Chapter 15). We know very little about the long history even of formal volunteering, since volunteering leaves few physical or written traces and was seldom mentioned by historians as a phenomenon until the past few hundred years. © David Horton Smith, Robert A.
