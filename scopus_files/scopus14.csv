The basis of the systematization is concept ""paradigm"". The paradigms of Indian traditional knowledge were the science of ritual (kalpa) and grammar (vyakarana). Just two sciences determined the contents and the architecture of texts for all traditional Indian sciences (vidyas and sastras) and philosophies (darsanas). Later the norms and forms of organization from two sciences were borrowed by Indian epistemological and logical theories. If we don't know the way of the construction of the logical-epistemological theory (pramana-vada) we are not able to understand the authentic meanings of its conceptions.","Darsana; Kalpa; Paradigm of Indian theoretical knowledge; Sastras; Transversal philosophy; Vyakarana",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030722658

A plasma membrane-bound NEU1 modulating a plethora of receptors by desialylation, has been consistently documented from the last ten years. Despite a growing interest of the scientific community to NEU1, its membrane organization is not understood and current structural and biochemical data cannot account for such membrane localization. By combining molecular biology and biochemical analyses with structural biophysics and computational approaches, we identified here two regions in human NEU1-segments 139-159 (TM1) and 316-333 (TM2)-as potential transmembrane (TM) domains. In membrane mimicking environments, the corresponding peptides form stable α-helices and TM2 is suited for self-Association. This was confirmed with full-size NEU1 by co-immunoprecipitations from membrane preparations and split-ubiquitin yeast two hybrids. The TM2 region was shown to be critical for dimerization since introduction of point mutations within TM2 leads to disruption of NEU1 dimerization and decrease of sialidase activity in membrane. In conclusion, these results bring new insights in the molecular organization of membrane-bound NEU1 and demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of two potential TM domains that may anchor NEU1 in the membrane, control its dimerization and sialidase activity.",,"1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine; NEU1 protein, human; phosphatidylcholine; protein binding; recombinant protein; sialic acid derivative; sialidase; ubiquitin; alpha helix; amino acid sequence; animal; beta sheet; binding site; cell free system; cell membrane; chemistry; Chlorocebus aethiops; CV-1 cell line; enzyme specificity; enzymology; Escherichia coli; gene expression; genetics; human; metabolism; molecular model; plasmid; protein domain; protein multimerization; structural homology; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Binding Sites; Cell Membrane; Cell-Free System; Cercopithecus aethiops; COS Cells; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Humans; Models, Molecular; Neuraminidase; Phosphatidylcholines; Plasmids; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical; Protein Conformation, beta-Strand; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Multimerization; Recombinant Proteins; Sialic Acids; Structural Homology, Protein; Substrate Specificity; Ubiquitin","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85004038631

The exact mechanism of how a LINE-encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) recognizes its own and SINE RNA remains unclear. However it was shown for the stringent-type LINEs that recognition of a stem-loop at the 3'UTR by RT is essential for retrotransposition. For the relaxed-type LINEs it is believed that the poly-A tail is a common recognition element between LINE and SINE RNA. However polyadenylation is a property of any messenger RNA, and how the LINE RT recognizes transposon and non-transposon RNAs remains an open question. It is likely that RNA secondary structures play an important role in RNA recognition by LINE encoded proteins. Results: Here we selected a set of L1 and Alu elements from the human genome and investigated their sequences for the presence of position-specific stem-loop structures. We found highly conserved stem-loop positions at the 3'UTR. Comparative structural analyses of a human L1 3'UTR stem-loop showed a similarity to 3'UTR stem-loops of the stringent-type LINEs, which were experimentally shown to be recognized by LINE RT. The consensus stem-loop structure consists of 5-7 bp loop, 8-10 bp stem with a bulge at a distance of 4-6 bp from the loop. The results show that a stem loop with a bulge exists at the 3'-end of Alu. We also found conserved stem-loop positions at 5'UTR and at the end of ORF2 and discuss their possible role. Conclusions: Here we presented an evidence for the presence of a highly conserved 3'UTR stem-loop structure in L1 and Alu retrotransposons in the human genome. Both stem-loops show structural similarity to the stem-loops of the stringent-type LINEs experimentally confirmed as essential for retrotransposition. Here we hypothesize that both L1 and Alu RNA are recognized by L1 RT via the 3'-end RNA stem-loop structure. Other conserved stem-loop positions in L1 suggest their possible functions in protein-RNA interactions but to date no experimental evidence has been reported. © 2016 The Author(s).","Alu; L1; LINE; Mechanisms of retrotransposition; SINE; Stem-loop; Stem-loop structures","3' untranslated region; 5' untranslated region; Alu gene; Article; controlled study; gene; gene location; gene sequence; gene structure; human; human cell; L1 gene; long interspersed repeat; open reading frame; protein RNA binding; retroposon; transposon; Alu sequence; amino acid sequence; conformation; consensus sequence; genomics; human genome; long interspersed repeat; nucleotide sequence; position weight matrix; procedures; retroposon; RNA folding; 3' untranslated region; retroposon; 3' Untranslated Regions; Alu Elements; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Consensus Sequence; Genome, Human; Genomics; Humans; Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Open Reading Frames; Position-Specific Scoring Matrices; Retroelements; RNA Folding","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85001021731

Our research on print media shows that positive assessments of Russia's accession to the WTO prevailed before it entered into force. However, after the accession negative assessments started to dominate. This may be explained by the fact that before the accession it was mainly politicians and officials who expressed support for the act, while after the accession the negative views of the business community became more prevalent. Politicians and officials supported the accession by relying on abstract values of ""progress"" and ""open markets"", while businessmen's (mainly agribusiness) views took into account the non-competitiveness of their industries.

Conceptual metaphor models were analyzed in the English written texts produced by Russian students with different competences in economics - at both non-professional and professional levels of academic discourse (NPAD and PAD respectively). Metaphor Identification Procedure VU University Amsterdam (MIPVU) was applied to metaphor identification, and alternative metaphor and preferential conceptualization analysis was performed to compare the scope of source and the range of target in NPAD and PAD. Findings highlight the areas of commonality as well as divergence in terms of students' professional competence represented in conceptual metaphors in L2 writing. The main differences in the scope of the source analysis are quantitative rather than qualitative. The range of target comparison between NPAD and PAD indicates a significantly larger range of targets for the professional level students, a lower level of metaphorization for the non-professional level, and inclusive strategies across the two levels.

The drawback of such static models is their rapid obsolescence, the need for constant updating and unsuitability for medium-term forecasting. On the other hand, there are dynamic models that take into account the current macroeconomic situation but are designed for predicting and studying the overall price situation on the market rather than for mass appraisal of real estate with their variety of construction and performance characteristics. This paper proposes a technique of creating integrated models with properties of such static and dynamic models, i.e. taking into account both construction and performance characteristics of residential facilities and evolving macroeconomic situation in the country and in the world. Development of the technique and creation of models is carried out with the use of neural network technology on the basis of statistical data for the period from 2006 to 2016. In addition to its main purpose-the mass appraisal of urban apartments, the model is suitable for medium-term forecasting and identification of the patterns of the housing market. For example, the model was used to study the effect of the state financial policy on the housing market in Yekaterinburg. Computer experiments have shown that in case of growth in housing lending, the apartment prices will rise, and the rate of growth of luxury apartments with larger area will be about 2.2 times higher than the growth rate of cheaper apartments with smaller area. It was found that an increase in housing construction in Yekaterinburg up to 2,550 thous. sq.m. would lead to a further increase in value of apartments. However, with the increase in new housing above the 2,550 thous. sq.m. mark, the model predicts market saturation, prices growth cessation and their further decline. Similar studies and forecasts can be made for the real estate market in other countries and cities using the proposed technique. © 2016, ASERS Publishing House.

There is, however, reason to believe that the situation is quite different in Russia. Some studies have shown that the level of investment in training in Russia is much lower. This difference can be explained by the fact that employers do not see the point in such investment because it is much easier to lure employees with the required qualifications than to train their own staff. Moreover, Russia faces a problem with high employee mobility, meaning that companies are not sure that they will get a return on their investment. Given these circumstances, the present study examines whether investments in human capital in Russia are profitable. It investigates the wage return to job-related training using a difference-in-differences estimator to control for unmeasured differences in ability and measured differences in past wages as a proxy for ability and motivation. Estimates use panel data from The Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey – Higher School of Economics from 2004 to 2011. As predicted, positive returns to training are identified and the returns increase absolutely with the level of past wages. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994460862

Our explanation builds on recent evidence confirming Mancur Olson's claim (1982) that less encompassing actors tend to lobby for more distortionary policies. We hypothesize that with greater political competition government officials become more responsive to encompassing voices (i.e. associations of businesses as opposed to single firms), since the electoral costs of being captured by narrower interests becomes greater.

We say that the symplectic packings of M by balls are unobstructed if any collection of disjoint symplectic balls (of possibly different radii) of total volume less than V admits a symplectic embedding to M. In 1994, McDuff and Polterovich proved that symplectic packings of Kähler manifolds by balls can be characterized in terms of the Kähler cones of their blow-ups. When M is a Kähler manifold which is not a union of its proper subvarieties (such a manifold is called Campana simple), these Kähler cones can be described explicitly using the Demailly and Paun structure theorem. We prove that for any Campana simple Kähler manifold, as well as for any manifold which is a limit of Campana simple manifolds in a smooth deformation, the symplectic packings by balls are unobstructed. This is used to show that the symplectic packings by balls of all even-dimensional tori equipped with Kähler symplectic forms and of all hyper-Kähler manifolds of maximal holonomy are unobstructed. This generalizes a previous result by Latschev-McDuff-Schlenk. We also consider symplectic packings by other shapes and show, using Ratner's orbit closure theorem, that any even-dimensional torus equipped with a Kähler form whose cohomology class is not proportional to a rational one admits a full symplectic packing by any number of equal polydisks (and, in particular, by any number of equal cubes). © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Campana simple complex structure; hyper-Kähler manifold; Kähler cone; Kähler manifold; symplectic cone; Symplectic manifold; symplectic packing",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949034514

A vivid example of the commodification of unique objects is commercial surrogacy services, which transform the status of motherhood from being a “woman’s social vocation” into a service whose end product is a human life that is valued in monetary terms. According to Igor Kopytoff, blurring the boundary between goods and unique objects can undermine the social order (Kopytoff 2006). However, gainful surrogacy has not in fact undermined the social order, which raises the question of how the functioning and legitimate existence of such a service can be assured in society. The authors of the present article have analyzed 14 interviews with employees at Moscow reproductive clinics and agencies that provide legal support services for surrogate mothers.1 We demonstrate on the basis of this analysis that the way in which the child’s status is determined and the potential parents and surrogate mothers are selected as well as how the relations between the genetic parents and the surrogate mother are regulated confirm the notion of kinship that was pioneered in the Euro-American theory of David Schneider. This concept is based on the idea that kinship relations are determined primarily by the presence of a common genetic substance and only secondly by social relations that are based on specific patterns of behavior in the family (Schneider 1980). This implies that genetic kinship is of primary importance to how ideas about kinship relationships are developed, while at the same time it implies that ideas about gestational kinship are not believed to be as important. Thus, the belief of employees at clinics and agencies that the genetic link between parents and children predominates over the gestational relationship makes it possible to legitimize the practice of gainful surrogacy in general and certain aspects of the procedure by which the service is provided in particular by decommodifying the child so that he or she is no longer the object of a commercial transaction. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033386035

As a rule, at low temperatures, thin films of these materials demonstrate positive magnetoresistance due to weak antilocalization. Weak antilocalization should lead to resistivity decrease at low temperatures; in experiments, however, resistivity grows as temperature decreases. From transport measurements for several thin films (with various carrier density, thickness, and carrier mobility), and by using a purely phenomenological approach, with no microscopic theory, we show that the low-temperature growth of the resistivity is accompanied by growth of the Hall coefficient, in agreement with the diffusive electron-electron interaction correction mechanism.

Surprisingly, despite its relevance in the political debate, this topic has not been investigated empirically in the literature. In order to fill this gap, we develop a model of the decision to migrate focusing in particular on the role played by cultural traits. More specifically, we focus on radical Islam as a deterrent for migration. Following Berman (2003), we define radical Islam as a set of ideologies, also referred to as Political Islam, holding that Islam should guide not only personal life, but also social and political life. In our model, more radical values imply a higher psychological cost of migrating. This cost derives from the fact that connections with socio-religious friends and neighbors are generally not maintained after migration, thus deterring individuals from migrating (Mayers, 2000). We then test empirically the predictions of the model, using individual-level data from the second (2010–11) and third (2012–14) waves of the Arab Barometer. Our results suggest that, ceteris paribus, more radical individuals are less willing to migrate. This finding is robust to alternative specifications of the model and to the use of Instrumental Variables and Propensity Score Matching aimed at addressing the potential endogeneity of radical Islam. The result is also qualitatively unchanged when using aggregate data on actual outflows of migrants. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","culture and economics; migration; radical Islam","culture; economics; Islamism; migration determinant; modeling","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989912425

We investigated the dynamical mechanisms underlying the excitability type of dopamine (DA) neurons, using a conductance-based biophysical model, and its regulation by intrinsic and synaptic currents. Calibrating the model to reproduce low frequency tonic firing results in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) excitation balanced by γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition and leads to type I excitable behavior characterized by a continuous decrease in firing frequency in response to hyperpolarizing currents. Furthermore, we analyzed how excitability type of the DA neuron model is influenced by changes in the intrinsic current composition. A subthreshold sodium current is necessary for a continuous frequency decrease during application of a negative current, and the low-frequency “balanced” state during simultaneous activation of NMDA and GABA receptors. Blocking this current switches the neuron to type II characterized by the abrupt onset of repetitive firing. Enhancing the anomalous rectifier Ih current also switches the excitability to type II. Key characteristics of synaptic conductances that may be observed in vivo also change the type of excitability: a depolarized γ-Aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAR) reversal potential or co-activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) leads to an abrupt frequency drop to zero, which is typical for type II excitability. Coactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) together with AMPARs and GABARs shifts the type I/II boundary toward more hyperpolarized GABAR reversal potentials. To better understand how altering each of the aforementioned currents leads to changes in excitability profile of DA neuron, we provide a thorough dynamical analysis. Collectively, these results imply that type I excitability in dopamine neurons might be important for low firing rates and fine-tuning basal dopamine levels, while switching excitability to type II during NMDAR and AMPAR activation may facilitate a transient increase in dopamine concentration, as type II neurons are more amenable to synchronization by mutual excitation. © 2016 Morozova et al.",,"4 aminobutyric acid; 4 aminobutyric acid receptor; AMPA receptor; dopamine; n methyl dextro aspartic acid; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; calcium; dopamine; n methylaspartic acid; sodium; Article; dopamine release; dopaminergic nerve cell; firing rate; hyperpolarization; nerve cell excitability; potassium current; pyramidal nerve cell; sodium current; stimulus response; synaptic potential; biological model; biology; dopaminergic nerve cell; metabolism; physiology; Calcium; Computational Biology; Dopamine; Dopaminergic Neurons; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Models, Neurological; N-Methylaspartate; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Sodium","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007574681

With an increase of the number of shots irradiating the surface, its morphology changes from weakly pronounced wave-like structures or ridges to strongly developed ones. At later stages, due to the action of the secondary plasma produced near the target materials they melted, yielding both blisters and a fracturing pattern: first along the grain and then “in-between” the grains creating an intergranular net of microcracks. At the highest values of power flux densities multiple bubbles appeared. Furthermore, in this last case the cracks were developed because of microstresses at the solidification of melt.

Measurements extracted from diffusion-weighted (DW) images provide comprehensive in vivo measures of local microstructural properties of fiber pathways. In the current study, we compared microstructural properties of major white matter tracts implicated in language processing in each hemisphere (these included arcuate fasciculus (AF), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus (IFOF), uncinate fasciculus (UF), and corpus callosum (CC), and corticospinal tract (CST) for control purposes) between individuals with aphasia and healthy controls and investigated the relationship between these neural indices and language deficits. Thirty-seven individuals with aphasia due to left hemisphere stroke and eleven age-matched controls were scanned using DW imaging sequences. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), axial diffusivity (AD) values for each major white matter tract were extracted from DW images using tract masks chosen from standardized atlases. Individuals with aphasia were also assessed with a standardized language test in Russian targeting comprehension and production at the word and sentence level. Individuals with aphasia had significantly lower FA values for left hemisphere tracts and significantly higher values of MD, RD and AD for both left and right hemisphere tracts compared to controls, all indicating profound impairment in tract integrity. Language comprehension was predominantly related to integrity of the left IFOF and left ILF, while language production was mainly related to integrity of the left AF. In addition, individual segments of these three tracts were differentially associated with language production and comprehension in aphasia. Our findings highlight the importance of fiber pathways in supporting different language functions and point to the importance of temporal tracts in language processing, in particular, comprehension. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aphasia; Language; MRI-DTI; Stroke; White matter","adult; aged; aphasia; arcuate fasciculus; Article; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; comprehension; controlled study; corpus callosum; diffusion tensor imaging; female; fractional anisotropy; hemisphere; human; inferior longitudinal fasciculus; language disability; language processing; language test; male; occipitofrontal fasciculus; pyramidal tract; superior longitudinal fasciculus; uncinate fasciculus; white matter; anisotropy; aphasia; brain; diffusion tensor imaging; language; middle aged; nerve tract; pathophysiology; procedures; white matter; Adult; Aged; Anisotropy; Aphasia; Cerebrum; Corpus Callosum; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Pathways; Stroke; White Matter","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973473504

However, the systematics of this family remains poorly understood since no modern phylogenetic study has been undertaken to support any of the proposed classifications. The present study is the first molecular phylogeny of Tergipedidae based on partial sequences of two mitochondrial (COI and 16S) genes and one nuclear gene (H3). Maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis were conducted in order to elucidate the systematics of this family. Our results do not recover the traditional Tergipedidae as monophyletic, since it belongs to a larger clade that includes the families Eubranchidae, Fionidae and Calmidae. This newly recovered clade is here referred to as Fionidae, the oldest name for this taxon. In addition, the present molecular phylogeny does not recover the traditional systematic relationships at a generic level, and therefore, systematic changes are required. We recognize the following clades within Fionidae: Calma, Cuthona, Cuthonella, Eubranchus, Fiona, Murmania, Tenellia, Tergipes, Tergiposacca gen. nov., Rubramoena gen. nov. and Abronica gen. nov. The type species of Tergiposacca, T. longicerata nov. sp. is described. The other two new genera have a previously described species as their type species. Most of these taxa, with the exceptions of Eubranchus, Tergipes and Fiona are composed of radically different constituent species from their traditional membership, but appear to be supported by morphological synapomorphies as well as molecular data. Aenigmastyletus, Catriona, Phestilla, Tenellia and Trinchesia are nested within other clades and, thus are here considered as synonyms of the larger clades.

Brain areas frequently implicated in functional restitution of language after stroke comprise perilesional sites in the left hemisphere and homotopic regions in the right hemisphere. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying therapy-induced language restitution are still largely unclear. In this study, magnetoencephalography was used to investigate neurophysiological changes in a group of chronic aphasia patients who underwent intensive language action therapy (ILAT), also known as constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT). Before and immediately after ILAT, patients’ language and communication skills were assessed and their brain responses were recorded during a lexical magnetic mismatch negativity (MMNm) paradigm, presenting familiar spoken words and meaningless pseudowords. After the two-week therapy interval, patients showed significant clinical improvements of language and communication skills. Spatio-temporal dynamics of neuronal changes revealed a significant increase in word-specific neuro-magnetic MMNm activation around 200 ms after stimulus identification points. This enhanced brain response occurred specifically for words and was most pronounced over perilesional areas in the left hemisphere. Therapy-related changes in neuromagnetic activation for words in both hemispheres significantly correlated with performance on a clinical language test. The findings indicate that functional recovery of language in chronic post stroke aphasia is associated with neuroplastic changes in both cerebral hemispheres, with stronger left-hemispheric contribution during automatic stages of language processing. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aphasia; Intensive language action therapy; Language; MEG; Mismatch negativity; Neuroplasticity","adult; aged; aphasia; Article; clinical article; communication skill; controlled study; female; hemisphere; human; intensive language action therapy; language; language therapy; left hemisphere; magnetoencephalography; male; middle aged; mismatch negativity; nerve cell plasticity; right hemisphere; aphasia; brain; brain mapping; cerebrovascular accident; chronic disease; complication; convalescence; hemispheric dominance; magnetoencephalography; nerve cell plasticity; pathophysiology; physiology; speech; speech perception; stroke rehabilitation; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Aphasia; Brain; Brain Mapping; Chronic Disease; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Language; Language Therapy; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Middle Aged; Neuronal Plasticity; Recovery of Function; Speech; Speech Perception; Stroke; Stroke Rehabilitation; Treatment Outcome","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963591446

Extreme responding varies less between the two types of response modes, and is most prevalent among individuals seeing themselves as self-reliant, and in cultures favouring self-reliance.

Fast systems that contain no moving parts were developed to be used in the field, warehouses, drugstores, etc. At the same time, in general these portable/handheld spectrometers have a lower spectral resolution and a narrower spectral region than stationary ones. Vendors of portable instruments supply their equipment with special software for spectra processing, which aims at simplifying the analyst's work to the highest degree possible. Often such software is not fully capable of solving complex problems. In application to a real-world problem of counterfeit drug detection we demonstrate that even impaired spectral data do carry information sufficient for drug authentication. The chemometrics aided approach helps to extract this information and thus to extend the applicability of miniaturized NIR instruments. MicroPhazir-RX NIR spectrometer is used as an example of a portable instrument. The data driven soft independent modeling of class analogy (DD-SIMCA) method is employed for data processing. A representative set of tablets of a calcium channel blocker from 6 different manufacturers is used to illustrate the proposed approach.

The roles of ion charge and ion solvation are investigated by comparing Li+ vs Mg2+ and Li+ vs its solvatocomplex with two ethylene carbonate (EC) molecules, [Li(EC)2]+. Two achiral nanotubes with similar radii but different electronic structure are considered, namely, the metallic, (15,15) armchair, and semiconducting, (26,0) zigzag, SWCNTs. The intercalation process is energetically favorable for both CNT topologies, with all bare cations and the solvatocomplex under investigation, with the doubly charged Mg2+ ion exhibiting the highest energy gain. Insertion of the bare ions into the SWCNTs increases the electronic entropy. The electronic entropy changes because the ions introduce new energy levels near the Fermi level. Those initially empty levels of the cations accept electron density and generate electronic holes in the valence band of both SWCNT topologies. As a consequence, the semiconducting (26,0) zigzag SWCNT becomes metallic, exhibiting hole conductivity. Solvation of the bare Li+ ion by EC molecules completely screens the influence of the ion charge on the SWCNT electronic properties, independent of the topology. The last fact validates the common practice of employing standard, nonpolarizable force field models in classical molecular dynamics simulations of electrolyte solutions interacting with CNTs. The strong dependence of the nanotube electronic properties on the presence of bare ions can be used for development of novel cation sensors for mass spectroscopy applications.

While the results of the simulation are expected to be close to real data, in practical cases there is notable disagreement between simulated and observed data.

Importantly, each of the neurons is excitable, as opposed to an oscillator; hence when uncoupled it sits at a subthreshold rest state. When the constituent neurons are mutually coupled via sufficiently strong fast excitatory synapses, the system demonstrates bistability between a fixed point (quiescent background state) and a limit cycle (memory state with synaptically driven spiking activity). Previous work showed that this persistent activity can be stopped by an excitatory input that synchronizes the network. Here we analyzed how this persistent state reacts to partial synchronization. We considered three types of progressively more complex excitatory synaptic kernels: delta pulse, square, and exponential. The first two cases were treated analytically, and the latter case numerically. Using phase-plane methods, we characterized the shape of the region, such that all orbits starting within it correspond to infinite spike trains; this constitutes the persistent activity region. In the case of instant coupling, all such active orbits were neutrally stable; in the case of noninstant coupling, the activity region contained a unique stable limit cycle (so the activity region was the basin of attraction for the limit cycle). This limit cycle corresponded to purely antiphase spiking of two neurons. Increasing synchronization shifted the system toward the border of the activity region, eventually terminating spiking activity. We calculated three measures of robustness of the active state: width of the activity region in the phase plane, critical level of synchronization that can be tolerated by the persistent spiking activity, and speed of reconvergence to the limit cycle. Our analysis revealed that the self-sustained activity is more robust to synchronization when each individual neuron is closer to SNIC bifurcation (closer to being an intrinsic oscillator), the recurrent synaptic excitation is stronger, and the synaptic decay is slower, which is in agreement with the existing data on local circuits in the cortex that show sustained activity. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,"Complex networks; Neurons; Oscillators (electronic); Basin of attraction; Excitatory synapsis; Partial synchronization; Persistent activities; Persistent spiking; Quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons; Stable limit cycle; Synaptic excitations; Synchronization; action potential; biological model; brain cortex; human; nerve cell; physiology; synapse; Action Potentials; Cerebral Cortex; Humans; Models, Neurological; Neurons; Synapses","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84997047841

We show that an interplay between quantum and classical anharmonicity-controlled fluctuations leads to unusual elastic properties of the membrane. The effect of quantum fluctuations is governed by the dimensionless coupling constant, g01, which vanishes in the classical limit (→0) and is equal to ≃0.05 for graphene. We demonstrate that the thermal expansion coefficient αT of the membrane is negative and remains nearly constant down to extremely low temperatures, T0 exp(-2/g0). We also find that αT diverges in the classical limit: α -ln(1/g0) for g0→0. For graphene parameters, we estimate the value of the thermal expansion coefficient as αT≃-0.23eV-1, which applies below the temperature Tuv∼g00∼500 K (where 0∼1 eV is the bending rigidity) down to T0∼10-14 K. For T<T0, the thermal expansion coefficient slowly (logarithmically) approaches zero with decreasing temperature. This behavior is surprising since typically the thermal expansion coefficient goes to zero as a power-law function. We discuss possible experimental consequences of this anomaly.

First, we introduce an anomalous pattern initialisation method for hierarchical clustering algorithms, called A-Ward, capable of substantially reducing the time they take to converge. This method generates an initial partition with a sufficiently large number of clusters. This allows the cluster merging process to start from this partition rather than from a trivial partition composed solely of singletons. Our second contribution is an extension of the Ward and Wardp algorithms to the situation where the feature weight exponent can differ from the exponent of the Minkowski distance. This new method, called A-Wardpβ, is able to generate a much wider variety of clustering solutions. We also demonstrate that its parameters can be estimated reasonably well by using a cluster validity index. We perform numerous experiments using data sets with two types of noise, insertion of noise features and blurring within-cluster values of some features. These experiments allow us to conclude: (i) our anomalous pattern initialisation method does indeed reduce the time a hierarchical clustering algorithm takes to complete, without negatively impacting its cluster recovery ability; (ii) A-Wardpβ provides better cluster recovery than both Ward and Wardp. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Feature weighting; Hierarchical clustering; Initialisation algorithm; Minkowski metric","Algorithms; Magnetic disk storage; Cluster validity indices; Clustering solutions; Feature weighting; Hier-archical clustering; Hierarchical clustering algorithms; Minkowski distance; Minkowski metric; Number of clusters; Clustering algorithms","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982851370

Optimal conditions for the focusing of many solitons are formulated explicitly. Namely, trains of ordered solitons with alternate polarities evolve to huge strongly localized transient waves. The focused wave amplitude is exactly the sum of the focusing soliton heights; the maximum wave inherits the polarity of the fastest soliton in the train. The focusing of several solitary waves or/and breathers may naturally occur in a soliton gas and will lead to rogue-wave-type dynamics; hence, it represents a new nonlinear mechanism of rogue wave generation. The discovered scenario depends crucially on the soliton polarities (phases), and is not taken into account by existing kinetic theories. The performance of the soliton mechanism of rogue wave generation is shown for the example of the focusing MKdV equation, when solitons possess ""frozen"" phases (certain polarities), though the approach is efficient in some other integrable systems which admit soliton and breather solutions. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,"Focusing; Korteweg-de Vries equation; Integrable systems; Korteweg-de Vries; MkDv equation; Nonlinear mechanisms; Optimal conditions; Soliton interactions; Transient waves; Type dynamics; Solitons","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995976566

Human temporal lobe epilepsy has been associated with dysfunction or loss of the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 in a subset of pyramidal cells in the subiculum,a key structure generating epileptic activities. KCC2 regulates intraneuronal chloride and extracellular potassium levels by extruding both ions. Absence of effective KCC2 may alter the dynamics of chloride and potassium levels during repeated activation of GABAergic synapses due to interneuron activity. In turn,such GABAergic stress may itself affect Cl - regulation. Such changes in ionic homeostasis may switch GABAergic signaling from inhibitory to excitatory in affected pyramidal cells and also increase neuronal excitability. Possibly these changes contribute to periodic bursting in pyramidal cells,an essential component in the onset of ictal epileptic events. We tested this hypothesis with a computational model of a subicular network with realistic connectivity. The pyramidal cell model explicitly incorporated the cotransporter KCC2 and its effects on the internal/external chloride and potassium levels. Our network model suggested the loss of KCC2 in a critical number of pyramidal cells increased external potassium and intracellular chloride concentrations leading to seizure-like field potential oscillations. These oscillations included transient discharges leading to ictal-like field events with frequency spectra as in vitro. Restoration of KCC2 function suppressed seizure activity and thus may present a useful therapeutic option. These simulations therefore suggest that reduced KCC2 cotransporter activity alone may underlie the generation of ictal discharges. © 2016 the authors.","Epilepsy; Extracellular potassium; GABA; Intracellular chloride; KCC2; Subiculum","AMPA receptor; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; potassium chloride cotransporter 2; cotransporter; potassium-chloride symporters; adult; Article; chloride current; clinical article; controlled study; depolarization; epilepsy; female; firing rate; homeostasis; human; human tissue; ion current; male; nerve cell excitability; nerve conduction; nervous system conductance; potassium cell level; priority journal; spike wave; animal; biological model; biological rhythm; channel gating; computer simulation; electroencephalogram; epilepsy; hippocampus; metabolism; nerve cell network; pathophysiology; Animals; Biological Clocks; Brain Waves; Computer Simulation; Epilepsy; Hippocampus; Humans; Ion Channel Gating; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Symporters","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996529445

However, little is known about the role of neuronal oscillations in encoding of rare stimuli. We aimed at verifying the existence of a mechanism for the detection of deviant visual stimuli on the basis of oscillatory responses, so-called visual mismatch oscillatory response (vMOR). Methods Peripheral visual stimuli in an oddball paradigm, standard vs. deviant (7:1), were presented to twenty healthy subjects. The oscillatory responses to an infrequent change in the direction of moving peripheral stimuli were recorded with a 60-channel EEG system. In order to enhance the detection of oscillatory responses, we used the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, designed for the optimal extraction of changes in the amplitude of oscillations. Results Both standard and deviant visual stimuli produced Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) and Synchronization (ERS) primarily in the occipito–parietal cortical areas. ERD and ERS had overlapping time-courses and peaked at about 500–730 ms. These oscillatory responses, however, were significantly stronger for the deviant than for the standard stimuli. A difference between the oscillatory responses to deviant and standard stimuli thus reflects the presence of vMOR. Conclusions The present study shows that the detection of visual deviant stimuli can be reflected in both synchronization and desynchronization of neuronal oscillations. This broadens our knowledge about the brain mechanisms encoding deviant sensory stimuli. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Electroencephalography (EEG); Event-related desynchronization (ERD); Event-related potential (ERP); Event-related synchronization (ERS); Mismatch negativity (MMN); Oscillations; Peripheral vision; Visual mismatch oscillatory response (vMOR)","adult; alpha rhythm; Article; attention; electrooculography; event related synchronization; evoked response; female; human; human experiment; male; mismatch negativity; normal human; occipital cortex; parietal cortex; priority journal; signal noise ratio; visual deviant stimulus; visual mismatch oscillatory response; visual stimulation; electroencephalography phase synchronization; occipital lobe; parietal lobe; physiology; signal processing; vision; Adult; Electroencephalography Phase Synchronization; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Male; Occipital Lobe; Parietal Lobe; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Visual Perception","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994047184

The PE is exposed to an external electric field that favours its adsorption on the plane. The free end of the chain is linked to a deformable target body. By varying the field, one can alter the length of the non-adsorbed part of the chain. This entails variation of the deformation of the target body and hence variation of the force arising in the body. Our theoretical predictions for the generated force are in very good agreement with the MD data. Using the theory developed for the generated force, we study the effectiveness of possible PEbased nano-vices, composed of two clenching planes connected by PEs and exposed to an external electric field. We exploit the Cundall-Strack solid friction model to describe the friction between a particle and the clenching planes. We compute the diffusion coefficient of a clenched particle and show that it drastically decreases even in weak applied fields.

Detectors based on superconductor nanowires attached to optical waveguides are particularly appealing for this purpose. However, their speed is limited because the required high absorption efficiency necessitates long nanowires deposited on top of the waveguide. This enhances the kinetic inductance and makes the detectors slow. Here, we solve this problem by aligning the nanowire, contrary to usual choice, perpendicular to the waveguide to realize devices with a length below 1 μm. By integrating the nanowire into a photonic crystal cavity, we recover high absorption efficiency, thus enhancing the detection efficiency by more than an order of magnitude. Our cavity enhanced superconducting nanowire detectors are fully embedded in silicon nanophotonic circuits and efficiently detect single photons at telecom wavelengths. The detectors possess subnanosecond decay (∼120 ps) and recovery times (∼510 ps) and thus show potential for GHz count rates at low timing jitter (∼32 ps).

So far, almost all production experiments and all comprehension experiments looked at binary features (primarily at number in Germanic, Romance, and some other languages, in several cases at gender in Romance languages). Among other things, it was noted that both in production and in comprehension, attraction effects are much stronger for some feature combinations than for the others: they can be observed in the sentences with singular heads and plural dependent nouns (e.g.,""The key to the cabinets..""), but not in the sentences with plural heads and singular dependent nouns (e.g., ""The keys to the cabinet..""). Almost all proposed explanations of this asymmetry appeal to feature markedness, but existing findings do not allow teasing different approaches to markedness apart. We report the results of four experiments (one on production and three on comprehension) studying subject-verb gender agreement in Russian, a language with three genders. Firstly, we found attraction effects both in production and in comprehension, but, unlike in the case of number agreement, they were not parallel (in production, feminine gender triggered strongest effects, while neuter triggered weakest effects, while in comprehension, masculine triggered weakest effects). Secondly, in the comprehension experiments attraction was observed for all dependent noun genders, but only for a subset of head noun genders. This goes against the traditional assumption that the features of the dependent noun are crucial for attraction, showing the features of the head are more important. We demonstrate that this approach can be extended to previous findings on attraction and that there exists other evidence for it. In total, these findings let us reconsider the question which properties of features are crucial for agreement attraction in production and in comprehension. © 2016 Slioussar and Malko.","Agreement; Attraction; Comprehension; Gender; Production; Russian",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006274519

The share of public investment in total expenditures and its productivity decrease the multiplier under the zero lower bound and increase it under a positive interest rate. In the former case, the higher share of liquidity-constrained borrowers weakens the negative effect of public investment, with an opposite impact in the latter case.

The paper is based on the results of a qualitative field study conducted in 2013 in the Perm region as part of a larger project on the description of informal healthcare in Russia. The authors used semi-structured interviews with salespeople and observations of their workplaces, as well as interviews with doctors and local residents. Although network marketing of health products in Russia is not widely practiced, it demonstrates vitality in adverse conditions. Unlike many other countries, Russia's main players are domestic companies that have successfully mastered imported direct selling technologies. The research reveals that these DSOs mimic healthcare institutions by not only medicalizing their products but also providing participants a diagnosis, medical advice, complementary and alternative medicine services, as well as education and promotion of healthy lifestyles. The salespeople's self-presentation is ambiguous: They criticize official healthcare but demonstrate loyalty to the conventional biomedical model at the same time. This medical mimicry can be considered the side effect of marketing efforts to stimulate sales, the result of the DSOs' policy to attract salespeople, the manifestation of mimetic isomorphism, and the result of the organizational specificity of DSOs, that is, expansion in the private sphere of members' lives, including healthcare. In our opinion, none of these reasons is an acceptable explanation, and further work in this direction is necessary to understand informal healthcare markets.","Biomedicine; Complementary and alternative medicine; Dietary supplements; Direct selling organization (DSO); Health products; Informal healthcare providers; Multi-level marketing (MLM); Network marketing",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008191242

Russian exporters are facing significant barriers to trade in foreign markets in the form of anti-dumping measures, in particular in the case of non-fuel exports. While Russia is striving to a higher degree of export diversification, this goal cannot be achieved given the current magnitude of the existing anti-dumping measures against Russian exporters that mostly affect two major export oriented industries, namely steel and fertilizers. This paper estimates losses of Russian exports resulting from the anti-dumping measures imposed by third countries. We use partial equilibrium model incorporated into the World Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS) software that allows performing tariff cuts simulations to estimate the effects of removal of the anti-dumping on trade. While this estimation is problematic due to the lack of firm-level data, our results show that the total loss of exports is around 3 Billion US$ where the major share is attributed to the anti-dumping measures imposed by the USA. We also give an overview of the instruments that could be used by Russian exporters to defend their interests in the context of the Russian membership to the WTO. While there is no absolute remedy to counteract discrimination resulting from anti-dumping, we believe that each legal instrument may be successfully used on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, the specific circumstances of each case must be taken into account. In this regard, we also identify and compare the determinants of litigation of anti-dumping measures in the WTO and under domestic judicial review procedures, namely in the US Court of International Trade (USCIT) and the EU General Court. Authors emphasise alternative solutions, namely the importance of cooperation of the exporter with the investigating authority or the additional rule in the regional trade agreements. Although the WTO dispute settlement is costly and time-consuming and does not normally lead to restoration of the market access, it may bring huge benefits for the exporter. These benefits stem from the legal interpretations, rulings and recommendations of the DSB on systemic issues that clarify the Anti-Dumping Agreement and directly affect the ways the antidumping investigations will be conducted in the future.","Anti-dumping measures; Dispute settlement system; International trade; Trade barriers; Trade remedies; US Court of International Trade; WTO",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002581175

The country entered the 20th century with a high growth rate and burgeoning industrialisation that included significant foreign capital. Historically exports primarily included raw materials such as grain and timber while imports consisted largely of machinery and consumer goods. The fast industrialisation and society changes involved large numbers of people in manufacturing, finally bringing success in many areas, especially education, nuclear and space studies, weaponry and health care. However, during the 20th century the general trend toward modernisation was interrupted by World War I, the Civil War, purges of the 1930s and World War II, which caused enormous loss to both the working population as a whole and, in particular, to its most creative members: the entrepreneurs and the intelligentsia. The collapse of the Soviet Union caused a further loss of industrial potential, a surge in emigration and the need to restructure socioeconomic institutions and launch a new wave of modernisation. At each such critical juncture, the country relied heavily on export of raw materials, struggled to restore human capital and defence capabilities, and was forced to import technologies and consumer goods, now and again as a century ago, while each time on a different level. © 2016 Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991457602

This paper compares Husserl’s and Schütz’s views on the structure and meaning of science and traces the roots of their radical divergence. Whereas Husserl increasingly emphasises the importance of phenomenological reduction for the genuine human science, Schütz eventually rejects reduction and restricts the social science to a specific system of relevancies within the reality of the lifeworld. This paper presents the argument that Schütz’s conception eliminates the possibility of a phenomenological justification of social science, as it implies that there are no rationally justifiable grounds to pursue science.

Primary invagination during gastrulation in the sea urchin provides one of the simplest and best-studied examples. The specific mechanisms of invagination remain unclear in spite of numerous observations. The problem of plane-stress deformation of an initially circular layer exposed to a constant internal pressure is considered. Active forces developed by cells are characterized by an active moment. The rheology of a layer is described by a Maxwell-type viscoelasticity equation, which links the passive bending moment with the curvature of the layer. The presence of a passive moment threshold below which bending is purely elastic is taken into account. The active moment is defined as a function of coordinates and time that is nonzero in a certain limited region. The function is assumed to gradually increase, reach a steady state, and then decline gradually. Both constant- and alternating-sign spatial distributions of the active moment are considered. Numerical simulation showed that among all of the considered variants a realistic sequence of shapes can only be obtained if the layer is viscoelastic, there is a finite threshold for the passive bending moment, and the distribution of the active moment is of an alternating-sign type. The sign of the active moment differs between the inner and outer areas of the active region, tending to bend the sheet inward in the inner area and outward in the outer area. This study made it possible to reach several conclusions on the nature of the macroscopic organization of invagination and to outline avenues of research into the cellular mechanisms that are capable of developing the corresponding forces. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","active media; cell systems; embryonic epithelium; mathematical modeling; morphogenesis",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013673917

In this chapter we prove the criteria of the tame embedding of 1- and 2-dimensional separatrices. We give the complete study of the simplest Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms with the wandering set of four points if exactly one of them is the saddle (the Pixton diffeomorphisms). We show that the invariant manifolds of the saddle point of such diffeomorphisms can be wildly embedded. It implies that there are countably many topologically non-conjugate simplest diffeomorphisms. The topological invariant in this case is the knot in the characteristic space homeomorphic to S2 × S1. Then we study the bifurcations through which the transition from one class of topologically conjugate diffeomorphisms to another occurs. The distinctive specialty of the new bifurcation is that the structure on the non-wandering set does not change but the qualitative change of the diffeomorphism is due to the change of the type of the embedding of the separatrices of the saddle points. This problem is connected to the problem of J. Palis and C. Pugh [8], that is to find a smooth curve with some “good” properties (finitely many bifurcations for instance) that joins two structurally stable systems (flows or diffeomorphisms). S. Newhouse and M. Peixoto showed in [7] that any two Morse-Smale flows on a closed manifold can be joined by an arc with finitely many bifurcations. Discrete systems are in contrast to this result. For example, S. Matsumoto showed in [5] that every orientable closed surface admits two isotopic Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms which cannot be joined by such an arc. For the dimensions larger or equal to 3 the problem is nontrivial even for the simplest diffeomorphisms “north pole - south pole”. The classical result of J. Cerf [3] states that for every two orientation preserving diffeomorphisms (and therefore for every two diffeomorphisms “north pole - south pole”) on S3 there is a smooth arc joining them. We show that it can be so chosen that the whole arc consists of the “north pole - south pole” diffeomorphisms. We show that for dimensions larger then 3 the problem is even more complicated. On the sphere S6 there are two “north pole - south pole” diffeomorphisms that cannot be joined by a smooth arc (it follows easily from the result by J. Milnor). Finally we show the way in which the sequence of two saddle-knot bifurcations results in transition from one class of topological conjugacy to another in set of Pixton diffeomorphisms.

We discuss the notion of stability of a dynamical system with respect to one of its characteristics, structural stability and Ω−stability in particular. We consider hyperbolic invariant sets, recall the theorem on existence of the stable and the unstable manifold for a point of such a set. We recall Hartman-Grobman theorem that a diffeomorphism in a neighborhood of a hyperbolic periodic point is topologically conjugate to its linearizion. We give the topological classification of hyperbolic fixed points. We present a brief explanation of the results of the “epoch of the hyperbolic revolution” begun in 1960s with the classical works by S. Smale and D. Anosov. We show the relations between the nonwandering set, the chain recurrent set and the limit set of a dynamical system (diffeomorphism). We present Smale’s spectral decomposition theorem which allows us to represent a hyperbolic nonwandering set of a diffeomorphism as the union of the disjoint closed transitive (basic) sets if the nonwandering set is the closure of the periodic points. We recall the criteria of structural and Ω−stability. The concepts of the symbolic dynamics, the reverse limit and the solenoid are presented as the means to describe the restriction of a dynamical system to its invariant set with complex dynamics.

Though such diffeomorphisms are similar in many ways to structurally stable flows on surfaces they have one property which makes them considerably different. This property is a possible non-trivial periodic action of the diffeomorphism in the fundamental group of the surface. The study of admissible collections of periodic data made it possible to solve the problem of realization of gradient-like diffeomorphisms. It also showed the interrelation between the dynamics of such diffeomorphisms and periodic transformations of surfaces whose classification is an important part of Nielsen-Thurston theory. In the present chapter we introduce a topological invariant for gradient-like diffeomorphisms on orientable surfaces. This invariant is a graph similar to that of Peixoto for structurally stable flows without cycles. We prove that such a graph equipped with a permutation of the set of the vertices completely determines the class of topological conjugacy of a gradient-like diffeomorphism on a surface. Moreover, we construct another complete topological invariant for these diffeomorphisms (a scheme) which is based on the representation of the dynamics of a diffeomorphism as “attractor-repeller” and on the subsequent study of the space of wandering orbits.We show that the class of topological conjugacy of a gradient-like diffeomorphism is determined (up to a conjugating homeomorphism) by a collection of 2-tori each of which has a family of circles embedded into it.

Lyapunov C. Conley introduced the notion of a Lyapunov function for a dynamical system (see Definition 7.1). In 1978 he proved the existence of a continuous Lyapunov function for every dynamical system [2]. This result is called the fundamental theorem of dynamical systems. If a Lyapunov function is smooth and the set of its critical points coincides with the chain recurrent set then this function is called the energy function. Very generally smooth flows admit an energy function (see, e.g. Theorem 6.12 in [1]), but it is not true for diffeomorphisms. First results on construction of an energy function (see Definition 7.2) belong to S. Smale. In 1961 [9] he proved the existence of an energy function, which is a Morse function, for every gradient-like flow (i.e.Morse-Smale flow without closed trajectories). K. Meyer [7] in 1968 generalized this result and constructed an energy function, which is a Morse-Bott function, for an arbitrary Morse-Smale flow. The only result of this kind for diffeomorphisms belongs to D. Pixton [8], who in 1977 proved the existence of an energy function, which is a Morse function, for Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms on surfaces. Furthermore, he constructed a diffeomorphism on the 3-sphere (we have already mentioned it in Chapter 4 as the Pixton’s example) which has no energy function, and he explained the phenomenon to be caused by the wild embedding of the separatrices of the saddle points. Recently the conditions of existence of an energy function were found in [3–6]. In section 7.1 we present important properties of a Lyapunov function, which is a Morse function, for Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms on n-manifolds. In section 7.2 we introduce a dynamically ordered Morse-Lyapunov function for an arbitraryMorse-Smale diffeomorphism of a 3-manifold with the properties closely related to the dynamics of the diffeomorphism. We show that the necessary and sufficient conditions of the existence of an energy function with these properties are determined by the type of the embedding of the 1-dimensional attractors (repellers), each of which is the union of the 0-dimensional and the 1-dimensional unstable (stable) manifolds of the periodic points of the diffeomorphism. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995578564

Let f, f' be orientation preserving A-diffeomorphisms of orientable compact manifolds Mn, M'n (possibly with boundary) respectively and let f, f' have nontrivial basic sets Λ, Λ' respectively which are in the interior of the manifold. The problem is to find necessary and sufficient conditions of existence of a homeomorphism h: Mn → M'n such that hf |Λ = f'h|Λ. We show that the problem of topological conjugacy for arbitrary 2-dimensional and 1-dimensional basic sets as well as 0-dimensional basic sets without pairs of conjugated points can be reduced to the analogues problem for widely situated basic sets on an orientable surface with boundary (possibly empty) which is called a canonical support of the basic set. The study of the latter is essentially based on the investigation of the asymptotic properties of the stable and unstable manifolds of the points of the basic sets on the universal cover. The suggested method solves the problem of realization of arbitrary 1-dimensional basic sets as well as 0-dimensional basic sets without pair of conjugated points by constructing a so called hyperbolic diffeomorphism on the support of the basic set such that it has an invariant locally maximal set on the intersection of two geodesic laminations. We show that the restriction of the diffeomorphism f to the basic set is a factor of the restriction of the hyperbolic diffeomorphism to the intersection of the respective laminations. If the basic set is widely situated on the torus then for it a hyperbolic automorphism of the torus (Anosov diffeomorphism) is uniquely defined and it is a factor of the initial diffeomorphism. If the diffeomorphism f is structurally stable then the support of the basic set can be constructed in such a way that the restriction of the initial diffeomorphism to it consists of exactly one nontrivial basic set and of finitely many hyperbolic periodic points belonging to the boundary of the support. This and the results on the classification of the Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms enable us to construct a complete topological invariant for important classes of structurally stable diffeomorphisms on surfaces whose non-wandering sets contain a nontrivial 1-dimensional basic set (attractor or repeller).

The algorithm exploits the popular statistical Maximum Likelihood approach for determination of unknown parameters of probability distribution of a multichannel data generated by micro-earthquake source and registered by the surface array in the presence of strong noise. In this paper we consider unique properties of the mentioned adaptive maximum-likelihood estimator (AMLE) in conditions when the noise affecting the surface array receivers contains strong time-spatially correlated (coherent) component of man-made origin. These conditions are typical when AMLE algorithm is implemented for location of the micro-earthquakes caused by the medium hydraulic fracturing at hydrocarbon deposit sites. In the mentioned conditions AMLE algorithm demonstrates capability to suppress coherent noise component and hence to significantly improve the accuracy of determination of the coordinates of micro-earthquake sources. In the paper we theoretically investigate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of AMLE statistic and show that this SNR tends to infinity while seismic noise becomes purely coherent. We have undertaken also the computer simulation of the micro-earthquake location with the help of AMLE algorithm using deployment of the 150 seismic receivers which corresponds geometry of a real USA surface seismic array. For this array we computed the model multidimensional realizations of the micro-earthquake signal, the coherent man-made noise component and the natural noise component. The results of this computer simulation have shown that in conditions when the power of the coherent man-made component of the modeled noise significantly exceeds the power of the natural component of this noise the errors of micro-earthquake source position determination become negligible. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Adaptive maximum likelihood estimator; Coherent noise suppression; Hydraulic fracturing; Micro seismic source; Multichannel signal processing","Adaptive algorithms; Earthquakes; Geophysics; Hydraulic fracturing; Hydrocarbon refining; Maximum likelihood; Maximum likelihood estimation; Parameter estimation; Probability distributions; Seismology; Signal processing; Coherent noise; Maximum likelihood algorithm; Maximum likelihood approaches; Maximum likelihood estimator; Micro-seismic; Multi-channel signal processing; Multidimensional realization; Statistical estimation; Signal to noise ratio; accuracy assessment; coordinate; geophysical array; hydraulic fracturing; maximum likelihood analysis; microearthquake; seismic noise; seismic source; signal processing; signal-to-noise ratio; source parameters","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989827691

As a result, six RSNs were isolated and cross-correlation matrices were computed for their time courses. Aphasic patients showed decreased correlations between posterior part of the default mode (pDMN) and both auditory (AUD) and right frontoparietal (RFP) networks. Additionally, we calculated regions of interest-based FC (ROI-FC), gray and white matter volumes in the ROIs overlapping with pDMN, AUD, and RFP. ROI-FC analysis showed decreased FC between the right pars triangularis and both right middle frontal and right superior frontal gyri. The decreased pDMN-RFP connectivity in patients is likely to reflect changes in FC of these nodes. The lesion in the regions overlapping with pDMN and AUD networks leads to the significantly decreased pDMN-AUD connectivity. Our results suggest that abnormal FC in stroke patients may reflect the impairment of activity not only in the regions directly affected by stroke lesion in the left hemisphere but also in the homotopic regions of the intact right hemisphere. The increase of gray and white matter volume in the right supramarginal gyrus, the functional hub of pDMN, AUD, and RFP networks, correlated with less speech impairment. This increase might reflect a right hemisphere neuroplasticity process to compensate the impaired function of the homotopic region of left frontoparietal network (LFP), pDMN, and AUD in the left hemisphere. The presented results contribute to the hypothesized compensative role of the transfer of attention and executive functions from the damaged areas in the left hemisphere to the right homotopic areas, accompanied by more preserved language skills at the chronic stroke stage. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.","aphasia (language); resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging; resting-state networks; stroke","adult; aged; aphasia; Article; attention; auditory evoked potential; brain region; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; default mode network; executive function; female; frontoparietal cortex; functional connectivity; gray matter; human; left hemisphere; male; middle aged; middle frontal gyrus; nerve cell network; nerve cell plasticity; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pars triangularis; priority journal; right hemisphere; speech disorder; stroke patient; superior frontal gyrus; supramarginal gyrus; white matter; aphasia; auditory cortex; brain ischemia; brain mapping; cerebrovascular accident; complication; frontal lobe; hemispheric dominance; nerve cell plasticity; nerve tract; parietal lobe; pathophysiology; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aphasia; Auditory Cortex; Brain Ischemia; Brain Mapping; Female; Frontal Lobe; Functional Laterality; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Pathways; Neuronal Plasticity; Parietal Lobe; Stroke","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995468067

The computing technology is based on the numerical solution of the Navier - Stokes equations for multiphase flows. The method of numerical solution of the Navier - Stokes equations uses a fully implicit algorithm. This algorithm removes stiff restrictions on the time steps and allows simulating a tsunami propagation in arbitrarily large water basins. The basic sampling equation formulas, coefficient types as well as the basic steps of the computational procedure are presented. The landslide is modeled by a single phase with its density and viscosity, which is separated by the interface from water and air phases. A parallel algorithm of the method implementation based on an algebraic multigrid method is proposed for the effective usage of the method to calculate the tsunami in large water areas. The multigrid method of implementation is based on algorithms of global level and cascading collection. These algorithms do not impose restrictions on the scale parallelization and allow the use of the proposed technology in petaflop class systems. It shows the possibility of simulating all the stages of the landslide-type tsunamis: generation, propagation and runup. The verification of the method is carried out by using the tests provided by the experimental data. The mechanism of bathymetric data accounting and the technology of constructing three-dimensional grid models are described.

Although prior work considers optimality in terms of number of pairing-product equations, this measure does not capture the exact number of pairings needed in verification. To fill this gap, we study the minimal number of pairings needed in verification of SPS.

We show that three pairings are necessary and at most one of these pairings can be precomputed. Second, we build an automated tool to search for schemes matching our lower bounds.

As life begins to hold more promise for increasing population segments, societies climb the utility ladder of freedoms: practicing and respecting universal freedoms becomes increasingly vital to take advantage of rising life opportunities.

It is argued, in particular, that the project increases the precariousness of vulnerable communities, who are exposed to the loss of livelihoods due to the enclosure of common land and extra-legal mechanisms through which land acquisitions for the project have reportedly taken place.

We test the theory-driven hypotheses about the association between residential choices and housing prices.

Seeking the neural correlates of the differences between instrumental and non-instrumental verbs, we conducted an fMRI study with 16 German speakers who performed a verb-object matching task with instrumental and non-instrumental verbs. We found that an extensive neural network including but not limited to frontal and temporal language-related areas was more involved in the semantic processing of non-instrumental compared to instrumental verbs. We argue that this reflects a greater load associated with the processing of less semantically structured/restricted representations of non-instrumental verbs.

These materials appear to be rather promising for fabrication of various nanoscale devices such as bolometers and transition edge sensors of electromagnetic radiation. The vividly debated subject of intrinsic spatial inhomogeneity responsible for the non-Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer relation between the superconducting gap and the pairing potential is crucial both for understanding the fundamental issues of superconductivity in highly disordered superconductors, and for the operation of corresponding nanoelectronic devices. Here we report an experimental study of the electron transport properties of narrow NbN nanowires with effective cross sections of the order of the debated inhomogeneity scales. The temperature dependence of the critical current follows the textbook Ginzburg-Landau prediction for the quasi-one-dimensional superconducting channel I c ∼ (1-T/T c ) 3/2 . We find that conventional models based on the the phase slip mechanism provide reasonable fits for the shape of R(T) transitions. Better agreement with R(T) data can be achieved assuming the existence of short 'weak links' with slightly reduced local critical temperature T c . Hence, one may conclude that an 'exotic' intrinsic electronic inhomogeneity either does not exist in our structures, or, if it does exist, it does not affect their resistive state properties, or does not provide any specific impact distinguishable from conventional weak links. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","quantum phase slips; strongly disordered superconductivity; thermally activated phase slips","Electromagnetic waves; Electron transport properties; Nanowires; Niobium compounds; Superconducting devices; Superconducting materials; Temperature distribution; Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer; Disordered superconductors; Effective cross sections; Nanoelectronic devices; Phase slips; Quantum phase; Spatial in-homogeneity; Transition-edge sensors; Nitrogen compounds","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994627496

Furthermore, we were interested in testing the stability of the connectivity patterns when adding or deleting regions of interest. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a group of 30 healthy right-handed subjects in the resting state were collected and a connectivity analysis was performed. To model the effective connectivity, we used the spectral Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM). Three DCM analyses were completed. Two of them modeled interaction between five nodes that included four DMN key structures in addition to either LHIP or RHIP. The last DCM analysis modeled interactions between four nodes whereby one of the main DMN structures, PCC, was excluded from the analysis. The results of all DCM analyses indicated a high level of stability in the computational method: Those parts of the winning models that included the key DMN structures demonstrated causal relations known from recent research. However, we discovered new results as well. First of all, we found a pronounced asymmetry in LHIP and RHIP connections. LHIP demonstrated a high involvement of DMN activity with preponderant information outflow to all other DMN regions. Causal interactions of LHIP were bidirectional only in the case of LIPC. On the contrary, RHIP was primarily affected by inputs from LIPC, RIPC, and LHIP without influencing these or other DMN key structures. For the first time, an inhibitory link was found from MPFC to LIPC, which may indicate the subjects’ effort to maintain a resting state. Functional connectivity data echoed these results, though they also showed links not reflected in the patterns of effective connectivity. We suggest that such lateralized architecture of hippocampal connections may be related to lateralization phenomena in verbal and spatial domains documented in human neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and neurolinguistics. © 2016 Ushakov, Sharaev, Kartashov, Zavyalova, Verkhlyutov and Velichkovsky.","DCM; Default mode network; Dynamic causal modeling fMRI; Effective connectivity; Functional connectivity; Hippocampal asymmetry; Resting state networks","causal modeling; clinical article; default mode network; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gene deletion; hippocampus; human; inferior parietal cortex; medial prefrontal cortex; neurophysiology; neuropsychology; posterior cingulate; rest","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994414346

We verified the 1D model of blood flow. Two examples of real medical applications are presented. The method for FFR estimation is proposed. Also we used the 1D model for prediction of surgical occlusion treatment. © 2016 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Blood; Computer circuits; Diagnosis; Hemodynamics; Medical applications; Noninvasive medical procedures; Pathology; Surgery; 3-d modeling; Blood flow modeling; Non-invasive diagnostics; Patient specific; Surgical operation; Vascular network; Vascular pathology; Vascular structures; Flow of fluids","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016093962

To provide a mechanistic explanation of how GABA neurons influence DA neuron firing, we developed a circuit model of the VTA. The model is based on feed-forward inhibition and recreates canonical features of the VTA neurons. Simulations revealed that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor (GABAR) stimulation can differentially influence the firing pattern of the DA neuron, depending on the level of synchronization among GABA neurons. Asynchronous activity of GABA neurons provides a constant level of inhibition to the DA neuron and, when removed, produces a classical disinhibition burst. In contrast, when GABA neurons are synchronized by common synaptic input, their influence evokes additional spikes in the DA neuron, resulting in increased measures of firing and bursting. Distinct from previous mechanisms, the increases were not based on lowered firing rate of the GABA neurons or weaker hyperpolarization by the GABAR synaptic current. This phenomenon was induced by GABAmediated hyperpolarization of the DA neuron that leads to decreases in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration, thus reducing the Ca2+- dependent potassium (K+) current. In this way, the GABA-mediated hyperpolarization replaces Ca2+-dependent K+ current; however, this inhibition is pulsatile, which allows the DA neuron to fire during the rhythmic pauses in inhibition. Our results emphasize the importance of inhibition in the VTA, which has been discussed in many studies, and suggest a novel mechanism whereby computations can occur locally. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.","Bursting; Dopamine; GABA; Synchronization; VTA","4 aminobutyric acid receptor; calcium; cation; dopamine; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; potassium; action potential; animal; biological model; dopaminergic nerve cell; Long Evans rat; male; metabolism; microelectrode; nerve cell inhibition; nerve tract; periodicity; physiology; ventral tegmentum; Wistar rat; Action Potentials; Animals; Calcium; Cations; Dopamine; Dopaminergic Neurons; GABAergic Neurons; Male; Microelectrodes; Models, Neurological; Neural Inhibition; Neural Pathways; Periodicity; Potassium; Rats, Long-Evans; Rats, Wistar; Receptors, GABA; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Ventral Tegmental Area","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991677080

Data on seven stocks, included in Ukrainian Exchange Index, for the period from January to December 2015 are considered. In total, seven big industrial, electric and military companies are selected from the Ukrainian Exchange: Avdiivka Coke Plant, PJSC; Azovstal Iron and Steel Works, PJSC; Raiffeisen Bank Aval, JSC; Centerenergo, PJSC; Donbasenergo, PJSC; Motor Sich, JSC; and Ukrnafta, OPJC. The sample amounts to 226 observations. The analysis covers descriptive statistics, correlation, and, finally, optimal investment weights, which are calculated using Sharpe ratio. Covariance matrix of returns is estimated by means of generalized orthogonal GARCH model with Gaussian and normalinverse Gaussian distributions for errors. Selected stocks during the considered period have on average negative rates of returns. At the same time, these stocks in most of cases are positively correlated with each other, leading hence to a fewer room for the efficient diversification. Both Gaussian and normal-inverse Gaussian portfolios preclude that on average investment weights one should be focused mainly on Centerenergo and Motor Sich stocks. Based on these results, the investor should buy 46% of Centerenergo's stocks and 34% of Motor Sich's stocks. Selected stocks during the considered period have on average negative rates of returns. At the same time, these stocks in most of cases are positively correlated with each other, leading hence to a fewer room for the efficient diversification. Despite this, our results denoted that implementation of multivariate GARCH together with normal-inverse Gaussian distribution for errors enables to reduce the portfolio risk substantially. Comparing optimal GO-GARCH portfolios with naïve portfolio with all weights equal and Ukrainian Exchange Index we demonstrate that the former provide smaller portfolio variance and better VaR than naïve portfolio and the Index. © 2016 Institute of Society Transformation.","GO-GARCH Model; Optimizations; Portfolio; Portfolio; Return; Risk; Stock Exchange",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994335539

This mutator effect relates to a wide range of biomedical problems. There are three possible phases: mutator phase, mixed phase and non-selective phase. We calculate the phase structure, the mean fitness and the fraction of the mutator allele in the population, which can be applied to describe cancer development and RNA viruses. We find that depending on the genome length, either the normal or the mutator allele dominates in the mixed phase. We analytically solve the model for a general fitness function. We conclude that the random fitness landscape is an appropriate choice for describing the observed mutator phenomenon in the case of a small fraction of mutators. It is shown that the increase in the mutation rates in the regular and the mutator parts of the genome should be set independently; only some combinations of these increases can push the complex biomedical system to the non-selective phase, potentially related to the eradication of tumors. © The Author(s) 2016.",,"biological model; genetic selection; molecular evolution; mutation; mutation rate; Evolution, Molecular; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Mutation Rate; Selection, Genetic","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990890477

regional, and national levels of maternal mortality, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015",2016,"The Lancet",156,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84994092884&doi=10.1016%2fS0140-6736%2816%2931470-2&partnerID=40&md5=73e768a57d6d54dce04e94781bf826bd","Background In transitioning from the Millennium Development Goal to the Sustainable Development Goal era, it is imperative to comprehensively assess progress toward reducing maternal mortality to identify areas of success, remaining challenges, and frame policy discussions. We aimed to quantify maternal mortality throughout the world by underlying cause and age from 1990 to 2015. Methods We estimated maternal mortality at the global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2015 for ages 10–54 years by systematically compiling and processing all available data sources from 186 of 195 countries and territories, 11 of which were analysed at the subnational level. We quantified eight underlying causes of maternal death and four timing categories, improving estimation methods since GBD 2013 for adult all-cause mortality, HIV-related maternal mortality, and late maternal death. Secondary analyses then allowed systematic examination of drivers of trends, including the relation between maternal mortality and coverage of specific reproductive health-care services as well as assessment of observed versus expected maternal mortality as a function of Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Findings Only ten countries achieved MDG 5, but 122 of 195 countries have already met SDG 3.1. Geographical disparities widened between 1990 and 2015 and, in 2015, 24 countries still had a maternal mortality ratio greater than 400. The proportion of all maternal deaths occurring in the bottom two SDI quintiles, where haemorrhage is the dominant cause of maternal death, increased from roughly 68% in 1990 to more than 80% in 2015. The middle SDI quintile improved the most from 1990 to 2015, but also has the most complicated causal profile. Maternal mortality in the highest SDI quintile is mostly due to other direct maternal disorders, indirect maternal disorders, and abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and/or miscarriage. Historical patterns suggest achievement of SDG 3.1 will require 91% coverage of one antenatal care visit, 78% of four antenatal care visits, 81% of in-facility delivery, and 87% of skilled birth attendance. Interpretation Several challenges to improving reproductive health lie ahead in the SDG era. Countries should establish or renew systems for collection and timely dissemination of health data; expand coverage and improve quality of family planning services, including access to contraception and safe abortion to address high adolescent fertility; invest in improving health system capacity, including coverage of routine reproductive health care and of more advanced obstetric care—including EmOC; adapt health systems and data collection systems to monitor and reverse the increase in indirect, other direct, and late maternal deaths, especially in high SDI locations; and examine their own performance with respect to their SDI level, using that information to formulate strategies to improve performance and ensure optimum reproductive health of their population.

Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) catalysed extraordinary political, financial, and social commitments to reduce under-5 mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. At the country level, the pace of progress in improving child survival has varied markedly, highlighting a crucial need to further examine potential drivers of accelerated or slowed decreases in child mortality. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides an analytical framework to comprehensively assess these trends for under-5 mortality, age-specific and cause-specific mortality among children under 5 years, and stillbirths by geography over time. Methods Drawing from analytical approaches developed and refined in previous iterations of the GBD study, we generated updated estimates of child mortality by age group (neonatal, post-neonatal, ages 1–4 years, and under 5) for 195 countries and territories and selected subnational geographies, from 1980–2015. We also estimated numbers and rates of stillbirths for these geographies and years. Gaussian process regression with data source adjustments for sampling and non-sampling bias was applied to synthesise input data for under-5 mortality for each geography. Age-specific mortality estimates were generated through a two-stage age–sex splitting process, and stillbirth estimates were produced with a mixed-effects model, which accounted for variable stillbirth definitions and data source-specific biases. For GBD 2015, we did a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in child mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and annualised rates of decrease for under-5 mortality and stillbirths as they related to the Soci-demographic Index (SDI). Second, we examined the ratio of recorded and expected levels of child mortality, on the basis of SDI, across geographies, as well as differences in recorded and expected annualised rates of change for under-5 mortality. Third, we analysed levels and cause compositions of under-5 mortality, across time and geographies, as they related to rising SDI. Finally, we decomposed the changes in under-5 mortality to changes in SDI at the global level, as well as changes in leading causes of under-5 deaths for countries and territories. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 child mortality estimation process, as well as data sources, in accordance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, 5·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5·7–6·0) children younger than 5 years died in 2015, representing a 52·0% (95% UI 50·7–53·3) decrease in the number of under-5 deaths since 1990. Neonatal deaths and stillbirths fell at a slower pace since 1990, decreasing by 42·4% (41·3–43·6) to 2·6 million (2·6–2·7) neonatal deaths and 47·0% (35·1–57·0) to 2·1 million (1·8-2·5) stillbirths in 2015. Between 1990 and 2015, global under-5 mortality decreased at an annualised rate of decrease of 3·0% (2·6–3·3), falling short of the 4·4% annualised rate of decrease required to achieve MDG4. During this time, 58 countries met or exceeded the pace of progress required to meet MDG4. Between 2000, the year MDG4 was formally enacted, and 2015, 28 additional countries that did not achieve the 4·4% rate of decrease from 1990 met the MDG4 pace of decrease. However, absolute levels of under-5 mortality remained high in many countries, with 11 countries still recording rates exceeding 100 per 1000 livebirths in 2015. Marked decreases in under-5 deaths due to a number of communicable diseases, including lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, measles, and malaria, accounted for much of the progress in lowering overall under-5 mortality in low-income countries. Compared with gains achieved for infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies, the persisting toll of neonatal conditions and congenital anomalies on child survival became evident, especially in low-income and low-middle-income countries. We found sizeable heterogeneities in comparing observed and expected rates of under-5 mortality, as well as differences in observed and expected rates of change for under-5 mortality. At the global level, we recorded a divergence in observed and expected levels of under-5 mortality starting in 2000, with the observed trend falling much faster than what was expected based on SDI through 2015. Between 2000 and 2015, the world recorded 10·3 million fewer under-5 deaths than expected on the basis of improving SDI alone. Interpretation Gains in child survival have been large, widespread, and in many places in the world, faster than what was anticipated based on improving levels of development. Yet some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still had high rates of under-5 mortality in 2015. Unless these countries are able to accelerate reductions in child deaths at an extraordinary pace, their achievement of proposed SDG targets is unlikely. Improving the evidence base on drivers that might hasten the pace of progress for child survival, ranging from cost-effective intervention packages to innovative financing mechanisms, is vital to charting the pathways for ultimately ending preventable child deaths by 2030.

Healthy life expectancy (HALE) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) provide summary measures of health across geographies and time that can inform assessments of epidemiological patterns and health system performance, help to prioritise investments in research and development, and monitor progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We aimed to provide updated HALE and DALYs for geographies worldwide and evaluate how disease burden changes with development. Methods We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015) for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLDs) for each geography, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using the Sullivan method, which draws from age-specific death rates and YLDs per capita. We then assessed how observed levels of DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends calculated with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator constructed from measures of income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Findings Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2015, with decreases in communicable, neonatal, maternal, and nutritional (Group 1) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Much of this epidemiological transition was caused by changes in population growth and ageing, but it was accelerated by widespread improvements in SDI that also correlated strongly with the increasing importance of NCDs. Both total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most Group 1 causes significantly decreased by 2015, and although total burden climbed for the majority of NCDs, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined. Nonetheless, age-standardised DALY rates due to several high-burden NCDs (including osteoarthritis, drug use disorders, depression, diabetes, congenital birth defects, and skin, oral, and sense organ diseases) either increased or remained unchanged, leading to increases in their relative ranking in many geographies. From 2005 to 2015, HALE at birth increased by an average of 2·9 years (95% uncertainty interval 2·9–3·0) for men and 3·5 years (3·4–3·7) for women, while HALE at age 65 years improved by 0·85 years (0·78–0·92) and 1·2 years (1·1–1·3), respectively. Rising SDI was associated with consistently higher HALE and a somewhat smaller proportion of life spent with functional health loss; however, rising SDI was related to increases in total disability. Many countries and territories in central America and eastern sub-Saharan Africa had increasingly lower rates of disease burden than expected given their SDI. At the same time, a subset of geographies recorded a growing gap between observed and expected levels of DALYs, a trend driven mainly by rising burden due to war, interpersonal violence, and various NCDs. Interpretation Health is improving globally, but this means more populations are spending more time with functional health loss, an absolute expansion of morbidity. The proportion of life spent in ill health decreases somewhat with increasing SDI, a relative compression of morbidity, which supports continued efforts to elevate personal income, improve education, and limit fertility. Our analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework on which to benchmark geography-specific health performance and SDG progress. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform financial and research investments, prevention efforts, health policies, and health system improvement initiatives for all countries along the development continuum.

of disease and injury increasingly detract from the ability of the world's population to live in full health, a trend largely attributable to an epidemiological transition in many countries from causes affecting children, to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) more common in adults. For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of 1990 to 2015. Methods We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical procedures. Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data sources, updates to literature reviews for 85 causes, and the identification and inclusion of additional studies published up to November, 2015, to expand the database used for estimation of non-fatal outcomes to 60 900 unique data sources. Prevalence and incidence by cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an improved version of the DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool first developed for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited to DisMod-MR 2.1 or where incidence and prevalence needed to be determined from other data. For GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator that combines measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility (the Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) and used it to compare observed patterns of health loss to the expected pattern for countries or locations with similar SDI scores. Findings We generated 9·3 billion estimates from the various combinations of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes, sequelae, and impairments by age, sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes had acute incidences in excess of 1 billion: upper respiratory infections (17·2 billion, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 15·4–19·2 billion) and diarrhoeal diseases (2·39 billion, 2·30–2·50 billion). Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each affected more than 10% of the world's population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type headache, iron-deficiency anaemia, age-related and other hearing loss, migraine, genital herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and ascariasis. The impairment that affected the greatest number of people in 2015 was anaemia, with 2·36 billion (2·35–2·37 billion) individuals affected. The second and third leading impairments by number of individuals affected were hearing loss and vision loss, respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) on a global basis. NCDs accounted for 18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale. Where rates were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower than that of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause included in our analysis. For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically accounted for 20–30% of total disability, largely attributable to nutritional deficiencies, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower back and neck pain was the leading global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause was sense organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in central Latin America; diabetes in four countries in Oceania; HIV/AIDS in three southern sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and legal intervention in two north African and Middle Eastern countries; iron-deficiency anaemia in Somalia and Venezuela; depression in Uganda; onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other neglected tropical diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is increasing the number of people living with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Shifts in the epidemiological profile driven by socioeconomic change also contribute to the continued increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well as the rate of increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by gaps in data availability and the variable quality of the data available, the standardised and comprehensive approach of the GBD study provides opportunities to examine broad trends, compare those trends between countries or subnational geographies, benchmark against locations at similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or weakness of the estimates available.

the UN General Assembly established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs specify 17 universal goals, 169 targets, and 230 indicators leading up to 2030. We provide an analysis of 33 health-related SDG indicators based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015). Methods We applied statistical methods to systematically compiled data to estimate the performance of 33 health-related SDG indicators for 188 countries from 1990 to 2015. We rescaled each indicator on a scale from 0 (worst observed value between 1990 and 2015) to 100 (best observed). Indices representing all 33 health-related SDG indicators (health-related SDG index), health-related SDG indicators included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG index), and health-related indicators not included in the MDGs (non-MDG index) were computed as the geometric mean of the rescaled indicators by SDG target. We used spline regressions to examine the relations between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI, a summary measure based on average income per person, educational attainment, and total fertility rate) and each of the health-related SDG indicators and indices. Findings In 2015, the median health-related SDG index was 59·3 (95% uncertainty interval 56·8–61·8) and varied widely by country, ranging from 85·5 (84·2–86·5) in Iceland to 20·4 (15·4–24·9) in Central African Republic. SDI was a good predictor of the health-related SDG index (r 2 =0·88) and the MDG index (r 2 =0·92), whereas the non-MDG index had a weaker relation with SDI (r 2 =0·79). Between 2000 and 2015, the health-related SDG index improved by a median of 7·9 (IQR 5·0–10·4), and gains on the MDG index (a median change of 10·0 [6·7–13·1]) exceeded that of the non-MDG index (a median change of 5·5 [2·1–8·9]). Since 2000, pronounced progress occurred for indicators such as met need with modern contraception, under-5 mortality, and neonatal mortality, as well as the indicator for universal health coverage tracer interventions. Moderate improvements were found for indicators such as HIV and tuberculosis incidence, minimal changes for hepatitis B incidence took place, and childhood overweight considerably worsened. Interpretation GBD provides an independent, comparable avenue for monitoring progress towards the health-related SDGs. Our analysis not only highlights the importance of income, education, and fertility as drivers of health improvement but also emphasises that investments in these areas alone will not be sufficient. Although considerable progress on the health-related MDG indicators has been made, these gains will need to be sustained and, in many cases, accelerated to achieve the ambitious SDG targets. The minimal improvement in or worsening of health-related indicators beyond the MDGs highlight the need for additional resources to effectively address the expanded scope of the health-related SDGs.

Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for all populations requires timely, robust evidence on local mortality levels and trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures. Methods We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14 294 geography–year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61·7 years (95% uncertainty interval 61·4–61·9) in 1980 to 71·8 years (71·5–72·2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11·3 years (3·7–17·4), to 62·6 years (56·5–70·2). Total deaths increased by 4·1% (2·6–5·6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55·8 million (54·9 million to 56·6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17·0% (15·8–18·1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14·1% (12·6–16·0) to 39·8 million (39·2 million to 40·5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13·1% (11·9–14·3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42·1%, 39·1–44·6), malaria (43·1%, 34·7–51·8), neonatal preterm birth complications (29·8%, 24·8–34·9), and maternal disorders (29·1%, 19·3–37·1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146 000 deaths, 118 000–183 000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 228 000–532 000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death. Interpretation At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

Although a possible link between this variability and ongoing brain oscillations was demonstrated, the results of the studies are not consistent with each other. Exploring this topic further is important since the modulation of MEPs provides unique possibility to relate oscillatory cortical phenomena to the state of the motor cortex probed with TMS. Given that alpha oscillations were shown to reflect cortical excitability, we hypothesized that their power and variability might explain the modulation of subject-specific MEPs to single- and paired-pulse TMS (spTMS, ppTMS, respectively). Neuronal activity was recorded with multichannel electroencephalogram. We used spTMS and two ppTMS conditions: intracortical facilitation (ICF) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). Spearman correlations were calculated within and across subjects between MEPs and the pre-stimulus power of alpha oscillations in low (8–10 Hz) and high (10–12 Hz) frequency bands. Coefficient of quartile variation was used to measure variability. Across-subject analysis revealed no difference in the prestimulus alpha power among the TMS conditions. However, the variability of high-alpha power in spTMS condition was larger than in the SICI condition. In ICF condition prestimulus high-alpha power variability correlated positively with MEP amplitude variability. No correlation has been observed between the pre-stimulus alpha power and MEP responses in any of the conditions. Our results show that the variability of the alpha oscillations can be more predictive of TMS effects than the commonly used power of oscillations and we provide further support for the dissociation of high and low-alpha bands in predicting responses produced by the stimulation of the motor cortex. ï¿½ 2016 Iscan, Nazarova, Fedele, Blagovechtchenski and Nikulin.","Brain stimulation; Electroencephalography; Motor evoked potentials; Oscillations; Paired-pulse; Variability","brain depth stimulation; dissociation; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; excitability; facilitation; human; modulation; motor cortex; motor evoked potential; oscillation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992484400

We derive the equation that describes the diffusion coefficient of the macromolecule in the vicinity of the transition and use it to fit the experimental data from pulsed-field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG NMR) experiments acquired for two globular proteins, lysozyme and RNase A, undergoing temperature-induced unfolding.

This study focuses on the intergenerational and gender differences in the age of sexual debut, first partnership, first marriage, and birth of the first child. Analysis of the data shows that the maximum number of starting demographic events takes place before age 35. In the average biography, the first event is sexual debut, the following events are matrimonial (marriage and partnership/cohabitation), and the last event is the birth of the first child. The greatest gender and generational differences are observed in matrimonial behavior: the popularity of unregistered unions is much greater among younger generations than among their predecessors, and young people’s interest in marriage is much lower. Men begin partnership and marriage about a year or two later than women. In reproductive behavior, there are greater gender differences than generational: men are more inclined to postpone the birth of the first child.

Empathic teachers were found to possess a higher level of morality; to communicate more successfully with their students; to encourage them to forge empathic relationships; and to successfully motivate their students. Yet, there is a dearth of literature on how to develop such empathy in teachers. The present study, which is based on a large body of research, investigated the contribution of teachers’ self-efficacy and emotional self-efficacy to teacher empathy. The sample comprised 543 teachers from the central region of Israel who completed self-report questionnaires. Findings indicated that both types of self-efficacy contribute to empathy in teachers, but the contribution of teacher self-efficacy is greater. These findings can benefit teacher educators, principals and others involved in teacher performance and well-being throughout the world. Findings may suggest that both efficacies are compelling variables that need to be addressed and enhanced in relation to teacher empathy. In addition, the findings strengthen the notion that social-emotional competence in teachers is strongly associated with teachers’ self-beliefs regarding their teaching efficacy. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emotional self-efficacy; Empathy; teacher self-efficacy",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976274326

How could it happen that the reform initiated by Italy and France in 2011 to ""re-nationalise the Schengen"" would in the end turn out to be just the opposite of what they sought to achieve? The article suggests that the major factor which helps explain this is the institutional position of the European Commission which holds exclusive right of legislative initiative, and the fact that by using its position, the Commission was able to win over the European Parliament to its side by effectively making it a veto-player in negotiations with the EU Council, thus trapping the Member States into the ""joint decision trap"". The research traces the reform process through all of its stages: Starting with the agenda-setting by the Italian authorities who applied alarmist rhetoric trying to securitize the migrants arriving to the Italian shores, proceeding with the choice between alternative solutions proposed by different actors and policy reform initiation, multilateral negotiations between the EU Member States and the European Parliament and, concluding with the adoption of the two legislative acts.

Russian and foreign studies have found that people with migration experience change their place of residence more easily compared with those who have never moved. Migrants are divided into two main types, namely, newcomers and long-time residents who have lived in a migration destination for a long time, and a transitional type from newcomers to long-time residents. Moscow, St. Petersburg, and their oblasts are subjects where migrants adapt the best. For a long time, in most Far Eastern and Siberian subjects (except for the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug and Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug), the large number of arriving migrants were compensated by large number of migrants who departed a region. The collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent socioeconomic crisis have shown that population outflow occurs primarily in regions with the highest share of new settlers. Attempts to force the development of areas with harsh natural conditions and low adaptation by the population led to a massive return migration. Ensuring the adaptation of new settlers and their transition to long-time residents, rather than a high number of arrivals, is important for regional migration policy. Adaptation largely depends on the level of socioeconomic development of regions and particular localities. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","adaptation of migrants; census; duration of residence; long-time residents; migration; migratory activity; newcomers; Russian regions","adaptive management; census; outflow; return migration; socioeconomic conditions; Leningrad; Moscow [Russian Federation]; Russian Federation; Saint Petersburg","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006106384

Each set of instruments has its institutional basis in Russia: the President, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Gazprom work in geopolitical ways but with frequent recourse to legal instruments, the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) promotes legal instruments and the Ministry of Energy (ME) is the centre of the technocratic activities, which Gazprom also frequently applies at present. This study therefore provides a more complex picture of Russian external energy policy. Moreover, it reveals a potential opening for a degree of policy convergence between the EU and Russia.

The main empirical finding of the study is: nominalizations exhibit a wider range of syntactic and semantic possibilities than fully inflected clauses. The finite verb in Ossetian is either perfective or imperfective and shows Slavic-type aspectual composition, but (prefixless) nominalizations are aspectless and are associated with English-type aspectual composition. Besides, deverbal nominals allow for transitivity alternations even if a corresponding finite verb does not. Our account for the observed pattern is based on the hypothesis that in the course of derivation, the range of options available at the VP level is narrowed down by the elements of functional structure, specifically, Asp and T. We argue that the role of Asp is to impose a quantization requirement on its complement predicate, while T interacts with the structure generated at the VP level in determining transitivity of a clause. Nominals can be built before Asp and T are merged, hence the semantic contribution of those heads is not part of their meaning. It that way, nominals provide us with a more direct access to the true characteristics of the verb and its immediate projections at early stages of derivation. © 2016 by De Gruyter Mouton.","argument realization; aspect; eventuality type; Nominalization",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990913017

Our numerical computations demonstrate the features of undular bore developing for different signs of the cubic nonlinear term. If cubic nonlinear term is negative, and initial wave amplitude is large enough, two undular bores are generated from the two breaking points formed on both crest slopes (within dispersionless Gardner equation). Undular bore consists of one table-top soliton and a group of small soliton-like waves passing through the table-top soliton. If the cubic nonlinear term is positive and again the wave amplitude is large enough, the breaking points appear on crest and trough generating groups of positive and negative soliton-like pulses. This is the main difference with respect to the classic Korteweg–de Vries equation, where the breaking point is single. It is shown also that nonlinear interaction of waves happens similarly to one of scenarios of two-soliton interaction of “exchange” or “overtake” types with a phase shift. If small-amplitude pulses interact with large-amplitude soliton-like pulses, their speed in average is negative in the case when “free” velocity is positive. Nonlinear interaction leads to the generation of higher harmonics and spectrum width increases with amplitude increase independently of the sign of cubic nonlinear term. The breaking asymptotic k4/3 predicted within the dispersionless Gardner equation emerges during the process of undular bore development. The formation of soliton-like perturbations leads to appearance of several spectral peaks which are downshifting with time. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Soliton interaction; Table-top soliton; Undular bore","Mathematical transformations; Nonlinear equations; Phase shift; Phase shifters; Solitons; Extended versions; Gardner equations; Internal tidal waves; Nonlinear interactions; Numerical computations; Soliton interactions; Table-top; Undular bore; Korteweg-de Vries equation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955282886

Our empirical analysis is based on data from a worldwide questionnaire survey at a multinational industrial company. While we find that managers assess forecasting effort lower and forecasting efficiency higher for direct cash flow forecasting than for indirect method forecasting, our analyses reveal that the variables in our model, the postulated relationships between them, and the estimated effect sizes are equally valid for both forecasting methods. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947968222

However, neural underpinnings of acquisition of novel morphology are still unknown. We implicitly trained our participants with new derivational affixes through a word–picture association task and investigated the neural processes underlying formation of neural memory traces for new affixes. The participants’ brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG), as they passively listened to the newly trained and untrained suffixes combined with real word and pseudoword stems. The MEG recording was repeated after a night's sleep using the same stimuli, to test the effects of overnight consolidation. The newly trained suffixes combined with real stems elicited stronger source activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) at ∼50 msec after the suffix onset than untrained suffixes, suggesting memory trace formation for the newly learned suffixes already on the same day.

Political affinity is defined as the similarity of national interests in global affairs. We argue that political affinity affects how foreign acquirers anticipate their bargaining position in their negotiations with domestic target firms. With decreasing political affinity, the host government becomes increasingly likely to intervene against foreign firms in an acquisition deal. Consequently, foreign acquirers need to provide a more lucrative initial offer to dissuade target firms from leveraging government intervention to oppose the acquisition. Our prediction is supported by strong evidence that political affinity, as revealed by UN general assembly voting patterns, leads to lower initial acquisition premiums. Managerial summary: Media reports suggest that politics plays an important role in international business transactions. However, we still know very little about how bilateral political relations affect corporate decision-making. In this article, we analyze the influence of the quality of bilateral political relations on the bidding behavior of foreign acquirers in cross-border acquisitions. We argue that the host government is more likely to intervene against the foreign acquirer during deal negotiations if the quality of bilateral political relations is poor. A lower political affinity between countries therefore decreases the bargaining power of the acquirer and pushes up the initial bid premium the acquirer has to offer to the local target. Our empirical results confirm our argument. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Our analysis of 1391 ORFs recently annotated in the soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 revealed that 78% of them contain less than 80 codons. Twenty-one of these sORFs are conserved in or outside Alphaproteobacteria and most of them are similar to genes found in transposable elements, in line with their broad distribution. Stabilizing selection was demonstrated for sORFs with proteomic evidence and bll1319-ISGA which is conserved at the nucleotide level in 16 alphaproteobacterial species, 79 species from other taxa and 49 other Proteobacteria. Further we used Northern blot hybridization to validate ten small RNAs (BjsR1 to BjsR10) belonging to new RNA families. We found that BjsR1 and BjsR3 have homologs outside the genus Bradyrhizobium, and BjsR5, BjsR6, BjsR7, and BjsR10 have up to four imperfect copies in Bradyrhizobium genomes. BjsR8, BjsR9, and BjsR10 are present exclusively in nodules, while the other sRNAs are also expressed in liquid cultures. We also found that the level of BjsR4 decreases after exposure to tellurite and iron, and this down-regulation contributes to survival under high iron conditions. Analysis of additional small RNAs overlapping with 3′-UTRs revealed two new repetitive elements named Br-REP1 and Br-REP2. These REP elements may play roles in the genomic plasticity and gene regulation and could be useful for strain identification by PCR-fingerprinting. Furthermore, we studied two potential toxin genes in the symbiotic island and confirmed toxicity of the yhaV homolog bll1687 but not of the newly annotated higB homolog blr0229-ISGA in E. coli. Finally, we revealed transcription interference resulting in an antisense RNA complementary to blr1853, a gene induced in symbiosis.

However, existing quantification methods require rather long acquisition and/or post-processing times, making implementation difficult both in research studies on healthy unsedated children and in clinical examinations. The goal of this work was to propose a novel strategy for fmy quantification within acceptable acquisition and post-processing times. Our approach is based on a 3-compartment model (myelin-related water, intra/extra-cellular water and unrestricted water), and uses calibrated values of inherent relaxation times (T1c and T2c) for each compartment c. Calibration was first performed on adult relaxometry datasets (N = 3) acquired with large numbers of inversion times (TI) and echo times (TE), using an original combination of a region contraction approach and a non-negative least-square (NNLS) algorithm. This strategy was compared with voxel-wise fitting, and showed robust estimation of T1c and T2c. The accuracy of fmy calculations depending on multiple factors was investigated using simulated data. In the testing stage, our strategy enabled fast fmy mapping, based on relaxometry datasets acquired with reduced TI and TE numbers (acquisition &lt;6 min), and analyzed with NNLS algorithm (post-processing &lt;5min). In adults (N = 13, mean age 22.4±1.6 years), fmy maps showed variability across white matter regions, in agreement with previous studies. In healthy infants (N = 18, aged 3 to 34 weeks), asynchronous changes in fmy values were demonstrated across bundles, confirming the well-known progression of myelination. © 2016 Kulikova et al.

A complex moment-angle manifold Z is constructed via certain combinatorial data, called a complete simplicial fan. In the case of rational fans, the manifold Z is the total space of a holomorphic bundle over a toric variety with fibres compact complex tori. In general, a complex moment-angle manifold Z is equipped with a canonical holomorphic foliation F which is equivariant with respect to the (C×)m-action. Examples of moment-angle manifolds include Hopf manifolds of Vaisman type, Calabi–Eckmann manifolds, and their deformations. We construct transversely Kähler metrics on moment-angle manifolds, under some restriction on the combinatorial data. We prove that any Kähler submanifold (or, more generally, a Fujiki class C subvariety) in such a moment-angle manifold is contained in a leaf of the foliation F. For a generic moment-angle manifold Z in its combinatorial class, we prove that all subvarieties are moment-angle manifolds of smaller dimension and there are only finitely many of them. This implies, in particular, that the algebraic dimension of Z is zero. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Holomorphic foliation; Moment-angle manifold; Non-Kähler complex structure; Simplicial fan; Transversely Kähler metric",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962713134

A similar increase, often called the paramagnetic Meissner effect (PME), was observed before in various superconductors and superconductor/ferromagnet systems. To explain the PME effect in the presented S/F bilayers a model based on a row of vortices located at the S/F interface is proposed. According to the model the magnetic moment induced below T C consists of the paramagnetic contribution of the vortex cores and the diamagnetic contribution of the vortex-free region of the S layer. Since the thickness of the S layer is found to be 3-4 times less than the magnetic-field penetration depth, this latter diamagnetic contribution is negligible. The model correctly accounts for the sign, the approximate magnitude and the field dependence of the paramagnetic and the Meissner contributions of the induced magnetic moment upon passing the superconducting transition of a ferromagnet/superconductor bilayer. © CopyrightEPLA, 2016.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84999788902

Having found the predictions of our algorithm to coincide with the original almost 90% of the time, we hypothesized that fully accurate prediction is not possible because, in many situations, more than one referential option is available.

We used data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study to estimate morbidity and mortality for acute viral hepatitis, and for cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by viral hepatitis, by age, sex, and country from 1990 to 2013. Methods We estimated mortality using natural history models for acute hepatitis infections and GBD's cause-of-death ensemble model for cirrhosis and liver cancer. We used meta-regression to estimate total cirrhosis and total liver cancer prevalence, as well as the proportion of cirrhosis and liver cancer attributable to each cause. We then estimated cause-specific prevalence as the product of the total prevalence and the proportion attributable to a specific cause. Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). Findings Between 1990 and 2013, global viral hepatitis deaths increased from 0·89 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 0·86–0·94) to 1·45 million (1·38–1·54); YLLs from 31·0 million (29·6–32·6) to 41·6 million (39·1–44·7); YLDs from 0·65 million (0·45–0·89) to 0·87 million (0·61–1·18); and DALYs from 31·7 million (30·2–33·3) to 42·5 million (39·9–45·6). In 2013, viral hepatitis was the seventh (95% UI seventh to eighth) leading cause of death worldwide, compared with tenth (tenth to 12th) in 1990. Interpretation Viral hepatitis is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Unlike most communicable diseases, the absolute burden and relative rank of viral hepatitis increased between 1990 and 2013. The enormous health loss attributable to viral hepatitis, and the availability of effective vaccines and treatments, suggests an important opportunity to improve public health.

Upon heating, it exhibits rapid reversible pore gating, which depolarizes neurons and generates action potentials. Underlying molecular details of such effects in the pore region of TRPV1 is of a crucial importance to control temperature responses of the organism. Despite the spatial structure of the channel in both open (O) and closed (C) states is known, microscopic nature of channel gating and mechanism of thermal sensitivity are still poorly understood. In this work, we used unrestrained atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of TRPV1 (without N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic domains) embedded into explicit lipid bilayer in its O- and C-states. We found that the pore domain with its neighboring loops undergoes large temperature-dependent conformational transitions in an asymmetric way, when fragments of only one monomer move with large amplitude, freeing the pore upon heating. Such an asymmetrical gating looks rather biologically relevant because it is faster and more reliable than traditionally proposed ""iris-like"" symmetric scheme of channel opening. Analysis of structural, dynamic, and hydrophobic organization of the pore domain revealed entropy growth upon TRPV1 gating, which is in line with current concepts of thermal sensitivity. © The Author(s) 2016.",,"TRPV1 protein, human; vanilloid receptor; chemistry; computer simulation; heat; human; molecular dynamics; protein domain; Computer Simulation; Hot Temperature; Humans; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Protein Domains; TRPV Cation Channels","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986915825

Our consideration is based on the R-matrix description which provides Lax pairs in terms of quantum and classical R-matrices. First, we prove that for relativistic (and non-relativistic) tops, such Lax pairs with spectral parameters follow from the associative Yang-Baxter equation and its degenerations. Then we proceed to matrix extensions of the models and find out that some additional constraints are required for their construction. We describe a matrix version ℤ 2 of the reduced elliptic top and verify that the latter constraints are fulfilled in this case. The construction of matrix extensions is naturally generalized to the monodromy preserving equation. In this way we get matrix extensions of the Painlevé VI equation and its multidimensional analogues written in the form of non-autonomous elliptic tops. Finally, it is mentioned that the matrix valued variables can be replaced by elements of noncommutative associative algebra. At the end of the paper we also describe special elliptic Gaudin models which can be considered as matrix extensions of the (ℤ 2 reduced) elliptic top. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","elliptic integrable systems; Euler-Arnold tops; noncommutative integrable systems; Painlevé VI equation",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988969739

One plausible explanation for such variability may relate to different neuronal states defining the reactivity of the cortex to TMS. In this study intrinsic spatio-temporal neuronal dynamics were estimated with Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC) in order to predict the inter-individual differences in the strength of intra-cortical facilitation (ICF) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) produced by paired-pulse TMS (ppTMS) of the left primary motor cortex. LRTC in the alpha frequency range were assessed from multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) obtained at rest before and after the application of and single-pulse TMS (spTMS) and ppTMS protocols. For the EEG session, preceding TMS application, we showed a positive correlation across subjects between the strength of ICF and LRTC in the fronto-central and parietal areas. This in turn attests to the existence of subject-specific neuronal phenotypes defining the reactivity of the brain to ppTMS. In addition, we also showed that ICF was associated with the changes in neuronal dynamics in the EEG session after the application of the stimulation. This result provides a complementary evidence for the recent findings demonstrating that the cortical stimulation with sparse non-regular stimuli might have considerable long-lasting effects on the cortical activity. © 2016 IBRO","EEG; motor cortex; neuronal dynamics; neuronal oscillations; TMS; variability","adult; alpha rhythm; Article; brain cortex; brain nerve cell; controlled study; correlation analysis; electroencephalogram; female; frontal cortex; human; human experiment; individuality; interindividual difference; intracortical facilitation; left hemisphere; long range temporal correlations; male; nervous system parameters; neuronal dynamics; normal human; parietal cortex; prediction; primary motor cortex; priority journal; short-interval intacortical inhibition; transcranial magnetic stimulation; volunteer; alpha rhythm; electroencephalography; electromyography; hand; motor cortex; motor evoked potential; nerve cell inhibition; physiology; skeletal muscle; time factor; transcranial magnetic stimulation; young adult; Adult; Alpha Rhythm; Electroencephalography; Electromyography; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Female; Hand; Humans; Male; Motor Cortex; Muscle, Skeletal; Neural Inhibition; Time Factors; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976556383

Participants (n = 659) responded to hypothetical moral scenarios describing situations where sacrificing one life resulted in saving five others. Though men and women from both types of cultures judged (1) harms caused by action as less permissible than harms caused by omission, (2) means-based harms as less permissible than side-effects, and (3) harms caused by contact as less permissible than by non-contact, men in both cultures delivered more utilitarian judgments (save the five, sacrifice one) than women. Moreover, men from Western cultures were more utilitarian than Russian men, with no differences observed for women. In both cultures, older participants delivered less utilitarian judgments than younger participants. These results suggest that certain core principles may mediate moral judgments across different societies, implying some degree of universality, while also allowing a limited range of variation due to sociocultural factors. ï¿½ 2016 Arutyunova, Alexandrov and Hauser.","Age; Cross-cultural; Gender; Individual differences; Moral judgment; Morality",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994403197

Firstly, at the level of ideology, it is important to rehearse the understanding of transition from that of merely area-based reforms and rather understand it as a totalizing project of planetary reach, which completes the subjugation of the whole world to capitalism and crowns neoliberalism as the only global order. Secondly, at the level of practice, it is important to properly account for the spatializing effects of that ideology–which is not simply “domesticated” by local practices, but itself mediates the subsumption of pre-existing practices by capital, thus alienating them from their history. Thirdly, at the level of the urban: while urban change is usually portrayed merely as a projection of societal relations, the urban is actually the central stage where ideology mixes with the everyday, through which the societal change is mediated; new meanings, social relations, and class divisions are construed; and through which ideological transition achieves its practical completeness. What combines these three levels is the notion of urbanization of transition, which articulates the centrality of the urban in the spectacular post-socialist experience. © 2016 The Author(s).

On the basis of this assertion, a theorem on an optimal strategy for controlling a semi-Markov process with a finite set of states is proved. In particular, it is established that if the test function of the objective functional of a control problem attains a global extremum, then an optimal control strategy exists, is deterministic, and is determined by the point of global extremum.

Much research has been devoted to this question in management, economic theory, and sociology. Nevertheless, due to the absence of a universal approach for conceptualizing firm success and differences in methodological assumptions, numerous studies have produced divergent findings. This has led to continuous debates on the meaning of market success, performance indicators, and measurement techniques. First, this paper addresses conceptual problems with application of the term ""effectiveness"" and analyzes the potential and limitations of an alternative construct? ""performance"". In addition, we attempt to systematize current theoretical implications in the field of strategic management and sociological theories of organization. We focus on strategic management because performance-related questions are central in this academic discipline. Contrary to their intellectual ancestors in industrial economics, strategists pay closer attention to firm-level internal factors affecting firm performance. This paper examines two concepts central to strategic management: firms' strategies and resources. We analyze strategic choice theory and contingency theory first, then turn our focus to core notions for a resource-based view-a dominant framework in strategy research. This article also addresses a sociological approach to the interpretation of firms' high performance. A sociological understanding of the mechanisms behind performance variety concentrates on external factors (environmental effects). Firm survival and successful adaptation practices are studied in network, ecological, and institutional traditions in sociology. Finally, we discuss methodological challenges in performance research that require a combination of theoretical implications from both fields. In order to build an adequate theory about sources of performance variance, one should include micro- and macro-indicators and explore synergetic effects.","Ecological approach; Effectiveness; Institutional approach; Network approach; Performance; Performance measurement; Resource-based view; Strategic management; Strategy",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992143983

By the charity of a business, we mean a non-systematic provision of financial support to those in need. Different theoretical approaches are applied to explain the motivations for charitable activity in business. Critical theory implies that charity is used as an ideological tool aiming for a positive public image. Theories of solidarity conceptualize charity as a moral obligation to conform to the norms of the community. In the model of patrimonial domination, the authority distributes privileges in exchange for loyalty. This study was conducted in 2015-2016 in a small Russian town; 21 semi-structured interviews were carried out with the owners of small- and medium-sized businesses. In addition, 13 interviews were conducted with recipients of business donations and experts in the field of charity (including leaders of non-proft organizations, schools, local media, and government representatives). The empirical results show that business charity is a result of the relationships between businesses, the local community, and local authorities. The local community sets a stable social order of charity in a small town. However, the most stable and significant charitable donations from businesses are possible only in the system of patrimonial exchanges.","Business charity; Critical theory; Local community; Patrimonial authority; Small- and medium-sized businesses; Solidarity",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992109252

Radaev suggested looking for topics that are not separate from empirical findings and connect many subject areas. A draft research project was considered as an illustrative example. The point was to relate a decrease in alcohol consumption by Millennials (those born in 1982-1999) to larger-scale social shifts and potentially to the withering away of a ""Soviet common man"" from the position of a dominant social type. Alcohol consumption was chosen as an indicator because of its close relationship to multiple life spheres: healthcare, politics, economy, everyday communication, etc. The paradox is that despite enjoying favorable conditions for drinking, Millennials consume about two times less alcohol than previous generations. By applying a cohort analysis to illuminate this paradox, Vadim Radaev attributed it to massive sociocultural changes in post-Soviet Russia. The presentation included a lively discussion of both methodical issues and general methodological considerations. The discussion was carried out by laboratory researchers Elena Berdysheva, Dilyara Ibragimova, Anna Kruglova, Olga Kuzina, Andrey Shevchuk, and numerous HSE students.","Alcohol; Big topics; Cohort analysis; Generations; Indicators; Millennials; Simple Soviet man; Social shift",,"Russian",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992093892

The worth of crimes is closely related to the criteria for evaluation of police performance. The data derived from 12 in-depth interviews with Russian police officers, nine indepth interviews with senior students of Moscow University of Russian Interior Ministry who are undergoing practice within police departments, and online discussions within the police community show that policemen in Russia made their practical decisions while balancing between multiple orders of worth. The theoretical framework of data interpretation is represented by symbiosis theories of valuations and the institutional logics approach. Operationalized as a set of cultural rules and expectations defining legitimate grounds for assessing and determining what rational behavior in a given organizational context really is, the concept of institutional logics stresses the interrelations between value-oriented and material dimensions of social action but allows one to stress the hierarchy and constant competition between various orders of worth in an organization. Four institutional logics - state, clan, quasi-market, and professional - are empirically identified. Each of them brings its own order of worth to the police organizational environment. Crimes in the eyes of the police always have a price - expressed in either ""checkmarks,"" points of recognition by the boss or colleagues, or money. The data suggest that, despite the hierarchy between the orders of (crimes') worth within the police system as a whole, in each case, institutional logics and criteria of worth related to them compete with each other. Depending on the characteristics of the criminal case and the situation in the police department at a given moment, the competition between various orders of worth is resolved by policemen in different ways. The results of the study shed light on the functioning of police discretion and help to accentuate the dysfunctional side of police reform in Russia.","Corruption; Justice; Orders of worth; Performance appraisal system; Policing reform in Russia; Professionalism",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992083585

Second, they find differences in institutional and extra-institutional mechanisms of recruitment for sociologists and offer a theoretical explanation. They offer the category of ""optical systems"" as a cultural framework of university organization used by various external and internal agents with different types of resources and motivation. ""Optical systems"" become an important source of coping with distrust and the fear of being cheated by ""noble swindlers"", since the dynamics of the academic world are forced by the replacement of the suspicions vocabulary. In this review, we give a brief analysis of the chapters, presenting the advantages and weaknesses. This book discusses several important issues: morals and markets in academia; the impact and work of economic incentives; and the strengths and weaknesses of social networks, academic pathways, and political culture. Because of its provocative statements, incriminating comments, and polemic conclusions, this book is worth reading for all those who are involved in the modern system of higher education and science-academics, civil servants, governors, and of course, various experts.","Academic Career; Academic markets; Institutional history; Mertonian question; Moral; Optical systems",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992028306

Therefore, ensuring correct behavior of such systems is an actual and important task. One of the most error-prone stages of system development in the framework of model-oriented approach is the implementation stage, in the course of which a program code is constructed based on the model developed. This paper presents an algorithm for automated translation of MAS models represented as nested Petri nets into systems of distributed components. Nested Petri nets are the extension of Petri nets in the framework of the nets-within-nets approach, which assumes that tokens in a Petri net may themselves be Petri nets, possess autonomous behavior, and interact with other tokens of the net. This makes it possible to model MASs with dynamic structure in a natural way. The translation presented in this paper preserves distribution level and important behavioral properties (safety, liveness, and conditional liveness) of the original model and ensures fairness of the target system execution. The use of such translation makes it possible to automate construction of distributed MASs by models of nested Petri nets. As a test example, translation of nested Petri nets into systems of distributed components was implemented on the basis of the EJB component technology. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,"Curricula; Mass transportation; Petri nets; Automated translation; Automatic construction; Autonomous behaviors; Behavioral properties; Component technologies; Distributed components; Distribution levels; System development; Multi agent systems","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988023703

Thus, the TTM methodology developed combines and jointly analyzes different datasets to gain intelligence to cover different phases of the technological evolution starting from the ‘emergence’ of a technology towards ‘supporting’ and ‘solution’ applications and more ‘practical’ business and market-oriented uses. Furthermore, the study presents a new algorithm for data clustering in order to overcome the weaknesses of readily available clusterization tools for the purpose of identifying technology trends.

Since this time, Russia went through number of steps of healthcare system modernization. Most attention was paid to the resource allocation, medical equipment and drug provision, the problem of the low quality of care was repeatedly addressed. Major direction of the efforts was the creation of obligatory technical standards of care. Methods I studied the volume of publication found in MEDLINE for period 1991–2014 and in the relevant Russian journals not covered by MEDLINE as well as legislation on health care introduced since 1991. Results The review found that despite some increase in volume of funding of health care system, and provision of incentives for quality, the progress with health care quality assurance is slow. The methodology of development of evidence based guidelines is not accepted. The control over conflict of interest of participants of the development of the guiding documents is not introduced. Economic factors are not systematically addressed in decisions on provision of health care interventions. The practice of the health technology assessment does not exist. The system of financial incentives for the quality of care dominates and is developing without evidence based criteria and evidence of its efficacy. Conclusion The documents prescribing quality healthcare are developing non-systematically in Russia. The acceptance of the modern methodology of guideline development, health technology assessment and control over conflict of interest is needed as a minimum prerequisite for the progress in the quality assurance. © 2016 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine","Clinical practice guidelines; Health care reform; Legal regulation; Quality of care; Russia; Standards","Article; biomedical technology assessment; conflict of interest; evidence based medicine; health care delivery; health care financing; health care policy; health care quality; health economics; human; practice guideline; priority journal; quality control; Russian (people); Russian Federation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963936114

This paper examines whether bank risks are explained by their exposure to the interbank market. The market discipline hypothesis suggests that bankers are well equipped to monitor their peers, and the interbank borrowing is par excellence an uninsured deposit. Consequently, banks with a larger exposure to the interbank market should present strong bank fundamentals. Using a sample of 37 Mexican banks, from December 2008 to September 2012, and dynamic panel models based on the SYS GMM estimator, I did not find evidence in favor of the market discipline hypothesis.

We study the structure and properties of VΔ and A∗(Δ) and give applications and connections to other subjects, such as Macaulay duality, Novik–Swartz theory of face rings of simplicial manifolds, generalizations of Minkowski’s theorem on convex polytopes, cohomology of torus manifolds, computations of volumes, and linear relations on the powers of linear forms. In particular, we prove that the analogue of the g-theorem does not hold for multi-polytopes. © 2016, Institute for Mathematical Sciences (IMS), Stony Brook University, NY.","Macaulay duality; Minkowski relations; Minkowski theorem; Multi-fan; Multi-polytope; Poincare duality algebra; Stanley–Reisner ring; Torus manifold; Volume polynomial",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034652113

We suggested that the overpopulation of owned dogs and their subsequent transition into stray dogs is a primary reason for the increase in the number of stray dogs. Information on owned dogs was obtained through a cross-sectional household survey of dogs owners in Omsk, Russia. Analysis of a vertical life table showed that the maximum mortality of owned dogs under 1 year of age was 53 %; in other age classes, the mortality was, on average, 5.6 %. Analysis of fecundity showed that 81 % of the owners do not mate their dogs; consequently, only 36 % of the adult females whelped at least once. Analysis of the Leslie matrix showed that the growth rate of the population of owned dogs was 1 % per year. This result shows minimum overpopulation. Previous dogs escaped or were lost or vanished in rare cases (approximately 0.5 %). However, in a megalopolis, even such low frequencies are significant (95 % CI: 1433–5473 individuals). Analyses of the demographic processes in a population of owned dogs showed that a transition from owned dogs to stray dogs exists. Overpopulation is not the key reason for the transition, but different accidents are: that is, pets are lost, run away, etc. The frequency of such events is small, but, because of the size of the city, the number of such dogs might be 10–39 % of the total number of stray dogs. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Demography of domestic dogs; Fecundity; Mortality; Owned dogs; Stray dogs",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969871510

Our experiments tested how human subjects perceive the layout of a naturally-illuminated indoor scene that contains common symmetrical 3D objects standing on a horizontal floor. In one task, the subject was asked to draw a top view of a scene that was viewed either monocularly or binocularly. The top views the subjects reconstructed were configured accurately except for their overall size. These size errors varied from trial to trial, and were shown most-likely to result from the presence of a response bias. There was little, if any, evidence of systematic distortions of the subjects’ perceived visual space, the kind of distortions that have been reported in numerous experiments run under very unnatural conditions. This shown, we proceeded to use Foley's (Vision Research 12 (1972) 323–332) isosceles right triangle experiment to test the intrinsic geometry of visual space directly. This was done with natural viewing, with the impoverished viewing conditions Foley had used, as well as with a number of intermediate viewing conditions. Our subjects produced very accurate triangles when the viewing conditions were natural, but their performance deteriorated systematically as the viewing conditions were progressively impoverished. Their perception of visual space became more compressed as their natural visual environment was degraded. Once this was shown, we developed a computational model that emulated the most salient features of our psychophysical results.

Until recently, roadmapping was used mainly for strategic planning, either from a technological or a market research perspective. Roadmaps emphasized either technological development or satisfaction of market demands but rarely both. Consequently, roadmaps either excessively stress the technology side, which might lead to technically sophisticated solutions that lack applicability, or overstress customer needs, neglecting business competence-building. Therefore, this paper develops a new integrated roadmapping approach that combines these two perspectives: it focuses on strategic planning by firms and public authorities for the long run goals of social and economic development, bringing together the market “pull” and technology “push” approach. This dual technique provides the potential for alternative means of choosing the most effective resource allocation. Integrated roadmaps include the various development stages of prospective innovations, e.g. stages of the existing innovation value chain, including R&D, manufacturing, market entry, services, and market expansion as well as prospective stages, including new technologies, products and services. The value of integrated roadmapping lies in its responsiveness to the challenges in innovation planning schemes for firms and sectors; it takes into consideration both future market requirements and the future resource basis for satisfying market needs, an approach not currently offered by traditional techniques. The paper develops a roadmapping methodology that can be used for planning firms' and public authorities' long-term innovation strategies. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; Innovation strategies; Integrated roadmap; Market pull; Market route; Roadmapping; Scenario; Technology push","Commerce; Economics; Innovation; Strategic planning; Foresight; Innovation strategy; Market pull; Roadmap; Roadmapping; Scenario; Technology pushes; Economic and social effects; future prospect; innovation; integrated approach; planning method; planning process; resource allocation; strategic approach; technological development","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949526171

Drawing on the national representative survey data conducted in Autumn 2015 by the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Science, the author comes to a conclusion that Russians demonstrate a socio-cultural consensus in their attitudes towards state and society. Russians perceive society as Power passing the responsibility for the sustainable and equitable development to the state. The statism of Russia is a bottom-up phenomenon since people of Russia overwhelmingly support a priority of the society's interests over the ones of an individual. The majority perceives Russia as a unique civilization that should avoid the Western way of modernization. The idea of the 'unique way' is a distinct feature of the national identity of Russians; it plays a pivotal role in the societal cohesion of the whole society. In this model, the state is considered to be responsible for any breach in the society, in particular for the injustice and exploitation. That's why the growing number of violations of the rights of Russian workers increases the risks of societal conflicts and lead to a delegitimisation of the official authorities. In conclusion, the author suggests the state being more responsible for the Russian nation in the sense of protecting the population from the structural violence and exploitation.","Crisis; Etacratism; Justice; National identity; Norms and values; Russian worldview; Social conflicts; State and society; Structural violence",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020446361

To reach this goal, we assessed the adrenal secretory activity (norepinephrine level) and activity of the Zuckerkandl’s organ under the conditions of destructed noradrenergic neurons of brain caused by (1) their selective death induced by introduction of a hybrid molecular complex, which consisted of antibodies against dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) conjugated with saporin cytotoxin (anti-DBH-saporin) into the lateral brain ventricles of neonatal rats; and (2) microsurgical in utero destruction of embryo’s brain (in utero encephalectomy). It was observed that 72 h after either pharmacological or microsurgical norepinephrine synthesis deprivation in the newborn rat’s brain, the level of norepinephrine was increased in adrenals and, conversely, decreased in the Zuckerkandl’s organ.

It is shown that when the field-aligned current increases so that the electron drift velocity exceeds a value of the order of the electron thermal velocity, the plasma becomes unstable to the formation of cavities with low density and strong electric field. The condition of instability is associated with the value of the background magnetic field. In the case of a relatively weak magnetic field (where the electron gyro-radius is greater than the ion acoustic wavelength), the current instability can lead to the formation of one-dimensional cavities along the magnetic field. In the case of a stronger magnetic field (where the ion acoustic wavelength is greater than the electron gyro-radius, but still is less than the ion gyro-radius), the instability can lead to the formation of 3D density cavities. In this case, the spatial scales of the cavity, both along and across the background magnetic field, can be comparable, and at the earlier stage of the cavity formation they are of the order of the ion acoustic wavelength. Rarefactions of the cavity density are accompanied by an increase in the electric field and are limited by the pressure of bipolar electric fields that occur within them. The estimates of typical density cavity characteristics and the results of numerical solutions agree with known experimental data: small-scale structures with a sufficiently strong electric field are observed in the auroral regions with strong field-aligned current. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Magnetospheric physics (2704 auroral phenomena, 2772 plasma waves and instabilities)","Acoustic variables measurement; Acoustic waves; Electric fields; Electrons; Gyroscopes; Ions; Magnetic fields; Magnetism; Magnetosphere; Electron drift velocity; Electron thermal velocity; Field aligned currents; One-dimensional cavities; Plasma waves and instabilities; Small-scale structures; Strong electric fields; Weak magnetic fields; Plasma diagnostics","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982735428

This is made possible with adaptive tag-aware profiling that follows an online learning strategy based on user history.

Moreover, the precision of prediction errors is thought to be modulated by attention. Much of this evidence comes from paradigms in which a stimulus differs from that predicted by the recent history of other stimuli (generating a so-called “mismatch response”). There is less evidence from situations where a prediction is not fulfilled by any sensory input (an “omission” response). This situation arguably provides a more direct measure of “top-down” predictions in the absence of confounding “bottom-up” input. We applied Dynamic Causal Modeling of evoked electromagnetic responses recorded by EEG andMEGto an auditory paradigm in which we factorially crossed the presence versus absence of “bottom-up” stimuli with the presence versus absence of “top-down” attention. Model comparison revealed that both mismatch and omission responses were mediated by increased forward and backward connections, differing primarily in the driving input. In both responses, modeling results suggested that the presence of attention selectively modulated backward “prediction” connections. Our results provide new model-driven evidence of the pure top-down prediction signal posited in theories of hierarchical perception, and highlight the role of attentional precision in strengthening this prediction. © 2016 Chennu et al.","Dynamic causal modeling; Electroencephalography; Hierarchical predictive coding; Magnetoencephalography; Mismatch effect; Omission effect","adult; Article; behavior assessment; causal modeling; connectome; electroencephalography; face validity; female; human; magnetoencephalography; male; mismatch negativity; perception; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; signal processing; task performance; attention; auditory evoked potential; biological model; brain cortex; brain mapping; cytology; diagnostic imaging; hearing; nonlinear system; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; sound; young adult; Adult; Attention; Auditory Perception; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Models, Neurological; Nonlinear Dynamics; Sound; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981311973

Previously, the auto/paracrine activity of SLURP-2 was considered to be mediated via its interaction with the α3β2 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here, we describe the structure and pharmacology of a recombinant analogue of SLURP-2. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed a three-finger' fold of SLURP-2 with a conserved β-structural core and three protruding loops. Affinity purification using cortical extracts revealed that SLURP-2 could interact with the α3, α4, α5, α7, β2, and β4 nAChR subunits, revealing its broader pharmacological profile. SLURP-2 inhibits acetylcholine-evoked currents at α4β2 and α3β2-nAChRs (IC 50 ∼0.17 and >3 μM, respectively) expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In contrast, at α7-nAChRs, SLURP-2 significantly enhances acetylcholine-evoked currents at concentrations <1 μM but induces inhibition at higher concentrations. SLURP-2 allosterically interacts with human M1 and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) that are overexpressed in CHO cells. SLURP-2 was found to promote the proliferation of human oral keratinocytes via interactions with α3β2-nAChRs, while it inhibited cell growth via α7-nAChRs. SLURP-2/mAChRs interactions are also probably involved in the control of keratinocyte growth.

A large body of literature suggests that both the changes in and the volatility of ToT may affect economic development in different ways.

Previous studies of homemade alcohol in Russia have almost entirely focused upon the use of samogon (moonshine) attributed to the northern style of drinking. No systematic analysis is available regarding the production and consumption of homemade wine. This paper explores the drinking patterns demonstrated by consumers of samogon and homemade wine in Russia. The main factors affecting the consumption of these beverages are investigated. Methods Data were collected from a 2014 nationwide survey of 14,986 respondents aged 15+ years. Beverage preferences, volume of consumed alcohol, drinking habits, and alcohol availability were the main measures reported. Demographic, socio-economic, spatial, and policy-related factors affecting homemade alcohol consumption are examined using logistic regression. Results The percentages of samogon and homemade wine consumers were similar, although a greater volume of samogon in pure alcohol was consumed compared to homemade wine. The groups of samogon and homemade wine consumers showed very little overlap. Unlike homemade wine consumers, samogon drinkers consumed larger amounts of alcohol and were more engaged in frequent and excessive drinking, drinking without meals and drinking in marginal public settings. Gender, education, regional affiliation, and type of residence showed opposite associations with regard to the consumption of samogon and homemade wine. Availability of homemade alcohol in the neighbourhood was the most influential predictor due to respondents’ own production, presence of homemade alcohol in friendship networks and at illegal market. The prices of manufactured alcohol and the consumption of homemade alcohol did not show significant relationships. Conclusion Consumers of samogon and homemade wine demonstrate contrasting drinking patterns that are largely driven by different factors. Samogon is consumed in a more hazardous manner, whereas homemade wine is consumed in a more moderate and law-abiding way. Illegal commercial samogon should be a special concern for alcohol policy. © 2016","Alcohol consumption; Drinking patterns; Homemade alcohol; Russia","alcohol; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; alcohol consumption; alcoholic beverage; Article; consumer; consumer attitude; drinking behavior; educational status; female; food availability; food preference; friendship; homemade wine; human; male; market; neighborhood; priority journal; residential area; Russian Federation; samogon wine; sex difference; social status; alcoholic beverage; commercial phenomena; drinking behavior; economics; epidemiology; middle aged; questionnaire; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; wine; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholic Beverages; Commerce; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Russia; Surveys and Questionnaires; Wine; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979587723

In such an environment, the problem of consistent transformation and loading of heterogeneous input data to various target repositories becomes a critical success factor. The objective of the project was to design a new conceptual approach to configurable data transformation, de-identification, and submission of health and genomic data sets. Main motivation was to facilitate automated or human-driven data uploading, as well as consolidation of heterogeneous sources in large genomic or health projects. Methods: Modern methods of on-demand specialization of generic software components were applied. For specification of input-output data and required data collection activities, we propose a simple data model of flat tables as well as a domain-oriented graphical interface and portable representation of transformations in XML. Using such methods, the prototype of the Configurable Data Collection System (CDCS) was implemented in Java programming language with Swing graphical interfaces. The core logic of transformations was implemented as a library of reusable plugins. Results: The solution is implemented as a software prototype for a configurable service-oriented system for semi-automatic data collection, transformation, sanitization and safe uploading to heterogeneous data repositories-CDCS. To address the dynamic nature of data schemas and data collection processes, the CDCS prototype facilitates interactive, user-driven configuration of the data collection process and extends basic functionality with a wide range of third-party plugins. Notably, our solution also allows for the reduction of manual data entry for data originally missing in the output data sets. Conclusions: First experiments and feedback from domain experts confirm the prototype is flexible, configurable and extensible; runs well on data owner's systems; and is not dependent on vendor's standards. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Customization; Extraction-transformation-loading; Genomic data; Manual entry optimization; Variety","Computer programming; Data handling; Data warehouses; Genes; Health; Java programming language; Metadata; Semantics; Software prototyping; Consistent transformations; Critical success factor; Customization; Data collection process; Extraction transformation loadings; Genomic data; Service Oriented Systems; Variety; Data acquisition; computer language; computer program; extraction; human; human experiment; logic; model; motivation; specialization; automation; computer graphics; computer interface; computer language; information processing; Internet; procedures; software; Automation; Computer Graphics; Data Collection; Internet; Programming Languages; Software; User-Computer Interface","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973860874

But according to the self-determination theory (SDT) model, high-level psychological needs, when met, are non-contingently beneficial (a main effect-only hypothesis).

In both studies, both the lower level and higher level need-satisfaction sets had strong main effects upon many positive work outcomes, including intrinsic motivation, organizational commitment, and SWB.

Such a mentality entails a strong commitment to the utilitarian, instrumental values of the market at the expense of more altruistic, expressive values. Drawing upon IAT, we hypothesize that at the individual level, integration into selected non-economic institutions will tend to inhibit the adoption of a marketized mentality, but the strength of this inhibiting effect will vary depending on the degree to which economic institutions and non-economic institutions in society are ‘balanced’ or ‘unbalanced’. Our theoretical arguments imply that observed levels of acceptance of a marketized mentality will vary significantly across societies and that this variation will be related to the degree of imbalance in the institutional order: We expect to observe a cross-level interaction such that the inhibiting effect of integration into non-economic institutions is attenuated as institutional imbalance increases.

Little research has examined differential patterns of help-seeking among students of ethnic minority and non-minority status. The present study conceptualizes school help-providing as remedial exchange of social capital among students. To explore possible barriers to such exchange, we compare help-seeking networks among mid-adolescents (15–16 y.o.) of migrant ethnic minority opposite those of non-minority origins, in Russian high schools (N = 3496). The data were collected in 183 classrooms from 49 schools of Greater Moscow area; network information was elicited from students’ nominations of their classmates whom they ask for help in Math. Statistical analysis relied on multilevel dyadic p2 model. The data strongly suggest that school performance, academic self-evaluation, and gender are factors affecting help-seeking and help-providing behavior in classroom. By contrast, socio-economic status and, importantly, ethnic minority status had no influence on peer help relations in Moscow schools, suggesting that (1) minority status does not universally introduce stigmatizing barriers in youth social capital exchanges; and (2) majority-minority dynamics may vary as a function of the macro-context in which adolescents are embedded.

Initial work on this concept focused on what is still widely regarded as its institutional core, the vast array of private, nonprofit institutions (NPIs), and the volunteer as well as paid workers they mobilize and engage. These institutions share a crucial characteristic that makes it feasible to differentiate from for-profit enterprises: the fact that they are prohibited from distributing any surplus they generate to their investors, directors, or stakeholders and therefore presumptively serve some broader public interest. Many European scholars have considered this conceptualization too narrow; however, arguing that cooperatives, mutual societies, and, in recent years, “social enterprises” as well as social norms should also be included. However, this broader concept has remained under-conceptualized in reliable operational terms. This article corrects this short-coming and presents a consensus operational re-conceptualization of the third sector fashioned by a group of scholars working under the umbrella of the European Union’s Third Sector Impact Project. This re-conceptualization goes well beyond the widely recognized definition of NPIs included in the UN Handbook on Nonprofit Institutions in the System of National Accounts by embracing as well some, but not all, of these additional institutions and forms of direct individual activity, and does so in a way that meets demanding criteria of comparability, operationalizability, and potential for integration into official statistical systems. © 2016, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Civil society; Conceptualization; Definition; National accounts; Nonprofit organizations; Social economy; Volunteer work","civil society; conceptual framework; European Union; ideology; institutional framework; nonprofit organization; planning theory; stakeholder; theoretical study; Europe","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976287202

They have complex internal dynamics, which allow them to fire spontaneously, display bistability, and also to be involved in network phenomena such as high frequency oscillations and travelling waves. Purkinje cells exhibit type II excitability, which can be revealed by a discontinuity in their f-I curves. We show that this excitability mechanism allows Purkinje cells to be efficiently inhibited by noise of a particular variance, a phenomenon known as inverse stochastic resonance (ISR). While ISR has been described in theoretical models of single neurons, here we provide the first experimental evidence for this effect. We find that an adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model fitted to the basic Purkinje cell characteristics using a modified dynamic IV method displays ISR and bistability between the resting state and a repetitive activity limit cycle. ISR allows the Purkinje cell to operate in different functional regimes: the all-or-none toggle or the linear filter mode, depending on the variance of the synaptic input. We propose that synaptic noise allows Purkinje cells to quickly switch between these functional regimes. Using mutual information analysis, we demonstrate that ISR can lead to a locally optimal information transfer between the input and output spike train of the Purkinje cell. These results provide the first experimental evidence for ISR and suggest a functional role for ISR in cerebellar information processing. © 2016 Buchin et al.",,"analytical parameters; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; cell function; inverse stochastic resonance; nerve cell excitability; nerve potential; neurotransmission; nonhuman; Purkinje cell; rat; resting state network; synapse; action potential; animal; biological model; biology; cytology; Markov chain; physiology; Purkinje cell; Sprague Dawley rat; Action Potentials; Animals; Computational Biology; Models, Neurological; Purkinje Cells; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Stochastic Processes","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988971422

Studies involving mismatch negativity (MMN) measurement show a low level of binding, whereas behavioral experiments suggest a higher level. We examined the possibility that the two levels of feature binding coexist and may be shown within one experiment. The electroencephalogram was recorded while participants were engaged in an auditory two-alternative choice task, which was a combination of the oddball and the condensation tasks. Two types of deviant target stimuli were used-complex stimuli, which required feature conjunction to be identified, and simple stimuli, which differed from standard stimuli in a single feature. Two behavioral outcomes-correct responses and errors-were analyzed separately. Responses to complex stimuli were slower and less accurate than responses to simple stimuli. MMN was prominent and its amplitude was similar for both simple and complex stimuli, whereas the respective stimuli differed from standards in a single feature or two features respectively. Errors in response only to complex stimuli were associated with decreased MMN amplitude. P300 amplitude was greater for complex stimuli than for simple stimuli. Our data are compatible with the explanation that feature binding in auditory modality depends on two concurrent levels of processing. We speculate that the earlier level related to MMN generation is an essential and critical stage. Yet, a later analysis is also carried out, affecting P300 amplitude and response time. The current findings provide resolution to conflicting views on the nature of feature binding and show that feature binding is a distributed multilevel process.

Examples are weighted Ky Fan and weighted Hadamard inequalities involving determinants of positive-definite matrices, and weighted Cramér-Rao inequalities involving the weighted Fisher information matrix. © 2016, Springer International Publishing.","concavity; convexity; weighed Cramér-Rao inequalities; weighted conditional entropy; Weighted entropy; weighted Fisher information; weighted Gibbs inequality; weighted Hadamard inequality; weighted mutual entropy; weighted relative entropy",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954357492

However, research has relied excessively on contrasts between North American and East Asian samples, and commonly used self-report measures of independence and interdependence frequently fail to show predicted cultural differences. We revisited the conceptualization and measurement of independent and interdependent self-construals in 2 large-scale multinational surveys, using improved methods for cross-cultural research. We developed (Study 1: N = 2924 students in 16 nations) and validated across cultures (Study 2: N = 7279 adults from 55 cultural groups in 33 nations) a new 7-dimensional model of self-reported ways of being independent or interdependent. Patterns of global variation support some of Markus and Kitayama's predictions, but a simple contrast between independence and interdependence does not adequately capture the diverse models of selfhood that prevail in different world regions. Cultural groups emphasize different ways of being both independent and interdependent, depending on individualism-collectivism, national socioeconomic development, and religious heritage. Our 7-dimensional model will allow future researchers to test more accurately the implications of cultural models of selfhood for psychological processes in diverse ecocultural contexts. © 2016 American Psychological Association.","Culture; Independence-interdependence; Self-construals","adolescent; cultural anthropology; cultural factor; female; human; individuality; male; personality; psychology; self concept; student; young adult; Adolescent; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Culture; Female; Humans; Individuality; Male; Personality; Self Concept; Students; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976470965

the burden of HIV/AIDS is essential for policy setting and programme evaluation. In this report from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we provide national estimates of levels and trends of HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and mortality for 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. Methods For countries without high-quality vital registration data, we estimated prevalence and incidence with data from antenatal care clinics and population-based seroprevalence surveys, and with assumptions by age and sex on initial CD4 distribution at infection, CD4 progression rates (probability of progression from higher to lower CD4 cell-count category), on and off antiretroviral therapy (ART) mortality, and mortality from all other causes. Our estimation strategy links the GBD 2015 assessment of all-cause mortality and estimation of incidence and prevalence so that for each draw from the uncertainty distribution all assumptions used in each step are internally consistent. We estimated incidence, prevalence, and death with GBD versions of the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP) and Spectrum software originally developed by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). We used an open-source version of EPP and recoded Spectrum for speed, and used updated assumptions from systematic reviews of the literature and GBD demographic data. For countries with high-quality vital registration data, we developed the cohort incidence bias adjustment model to estimate HIV incidence and prevalence largely from the number of deaths caused by HIV recorded in cause-of-death statistics. We corrected these statistics for garbage coding and HIV misclassification. Findings Global HIV incidence reached its peak in 1997, at 3·3 million new infections (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 3·1–3·4 million). Annual incidence has stayed relatively constant at about 2·6 million per year (range 2·5–2·8 million) since 2005, after a period of fast decline between 1997 and 2005. The number of people living with HIV/AIDS has been steadily increasing and reached 38·8 million (95% UI 37·6–40·4 million) in 2015. At the same time, HIV/AIDS mortality has been declining at a steady pace, from a peak of 1·8 million deaths (95% UI 1·7–1·9 million) in 2005, to 1·2 million deaths (1·1–1·3 million) in 2015. We recorded substantial heterogeneity in the levels and trends of HIV/AIDS across countries. Although many countries have experienced decreases in HIV/AIDS mortality and in annual new infections, other countries have had slowdowns or increases in rates of change in annual new infections. Interpretation Scale-up of ART and prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been one of the great successes of global health in the past two decades. However, in the past decade, progress in reducing new infections has been slow, development assistance for health devoted to HIV has stagnated, and resources for health in low-income countries have grown slowly. Achievement of the new ambitious goals for HIV enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 3 and the 90-90-90 UNAIDS targets will be challenging, and will need continued efforts from governments and international agencies in the next 15 years to end AIDS by 2030.

Interpretation is the certificate of creativity initiated by the text, but supported by consciousness of freedom of the subject making this certificate. The third type: ""understanding"" is process from sense of the literary text in which the author of the text and the understanding subject participate as equals, involving in this participation all set of cultural factors.

We use cluster analysis and negative binomial regression modelling to show that, unlike in most countries of the world, correlation between support of democracy and gender equality is very low in the Arab countries. There is a group of people in the region who support both democracy and gender equality, but they are a small group (about 17% of the population) of elderly and middle-aged people characterized by higher education and social status. A substantial number of poorly educated males express support for democracy but not for gender equality. Many people, especially young males aged 25–35 in 2007, are against both gender equality and democracy. Younger people tend to be both better educated and more conservative, those belonging to the 25–34 age group being the most patriarchal in their gender attitudes. Yet, controlling for age, education does have a positive effect on gender equality attitudes. Nevertheless, this phenomenon may reflect two simultaneous processes going on in the Middle East. On the one hand, people are getting more educated, urbanized, etc., which means the continuation of modernization. On the other hand, the fact that older people are the most liberal age group may point to a certain retrogression of social values in the younger generations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Arab Barometer; democracy; gender equality; Islam; modernization; patriarchal values",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84933059769

Here, we test how the brain's capacity to rapidly form new representations for spoken words is affected by prior individual experience in non-native language acquisition. Formation of new word memory traces is reflected in a neurophysiological response increase during a short exposure to novel lexicon. Therefore, we recorded changes in electrophysiological responses to phonologically native and non-native novel word-forms during a perceptual learning session, in which novel stimuli were repetitively presented to healthy adults in either ignore or attend conditions. We found that larger number of previously acquired languages and earlier average age of acquisition (AoA) predicted greater response increase to novel non-native word-forms. This suggests that early and extensive language experience is associated with greater neural flexibility for acquiring novel words with unfamiliar phonology. Conversely, later AoA was associated with a stronger response increase for phonologically native novel word-forms, indicating better tuning of neural linguistic circuits to native phonology. The results suggest that individual language experience has a strong effect on the neural mechanisms of word learning, and that it interacts with the phonological familiarity of the novel lexicon.",,"adult; brain; controlled study; exposure; human; human experiment; language; learning; phonetics; stimulus; verbal memory; adolescent; child; female; language; language development; linguistics; male; memory; multilingualism; physiology; verbal learning; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Child; Female; Humans; Language; Language Development; Learning; Linguistics; Male; Memory; Multilingualism; Verbal Learning; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979298754

To test its attractiveness, the author then compares the portfolio with benchmarks and random portfolios during the period from 2006 to 2013 using a Sharpe coefficient. Findings – The comparison of the constructed portfolio with the benchmarks demonstrates the importance of IC for market investors and the validity of the proposed tool.

The effect of economic recession, however, varies across Europe. The purpose of this paper is to understand why this is the case. It analyses the impact of economic recession and related policy changes on third sector development in Europe. The economic effects on TSOs are thereby placed into a broader context of changing third sector policies and welfare state restructuring. Design/methodology/approach – The paper focusses on two research questions: how has the changing policy environment affected the development of the third sector? And what kind of strategies have TSOs adopted to respond to these changes? The paper first investigates general trends in Europe, based on a conceptual model that focusses on economic recession and austerity policies with regard to the third sector. In a second step of analysis, the paper provides five country case studies that exemplify policy changes and responses from the third sector in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. Findings – The paper argues that three different development paths can be identified across Europe. In some countries (France and Spain), TSOs face a strong effect of economic recession. In other countries (Germany and Poland) the development of the third sector remains largely stable, albeit at different levels, whereas in the Netherlands, TSOs rather experience changes in the policy environment than a direct impact of economic decline. The paper also shows that response strategies of the third sector in Europe depend on the context conditions. The paper is based on the European project “Third Sector Impact.” It combines an analysis of statistical information with qualitative data from interviews with third sector representatives.

While the network dynamics underlying global oscillations have been well characterised, their function is debated. Here, we show that such global oscillations are a direct consequence of optimal efficient coding in spiking networks with synaptic delays and noise. To avoid firing unnecessary spikes, neurons need to share information about the network state. Ideally, membrane potentials should be strongly correlated and reflect a ‘prediction error’ while the spikes themselves are uncorrelated and occur rarely. We show that the most efficient representation is when: (i) spike times are entrained to a global Gamma rhythm (implying a consistent representation of the error); but (ii) few neurons fire on each cycle (implying high efficiency), while (iii) excitation and inhibition are tightly balanced. This suggests that cortical networks exhibiting such dynamics are tuned to achieve a maximally efficient population code. © Chalk et al.",,"excitation; gamma rhythm; membrane potential; noise; oscillation; spike; synapse; action potential; animal; biological model; brain cortex; gamma rhythm; nerve cell network; physiology; synapse; Action Potentials; Animals; Cerebral Cortex; Gamma Rhythm; Membrane Potentials; Models, Neurological; Nerve Net; Synapses","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979586913

While periods of transitions offer the rare opportunity for countries to break with historical path dependence, hyperinflations carry the risk of creating new path dependence prematurely. By speeding up dynamics during transformative processes, hyperinflations eliminate possible alternatives that might otherwise have been chosen.

The author argues that contemporary fan fiction as a postmodern literary field and ‘fictional anthropology’ is much broader in its transformative capabilities than it is believed even in fan studies, in particular in relation to world-building. She takes as an example Russian Harry Potter fan fiction and pays special attention to the production and reception of such fan fiction genre as crossover. Analysis of texts of this genre and a survey conducted in the Russian Harry Potter online community let her come to the conclusion that this transformative activity of contemporary fandoms in virtual worlds blurs all the lines between different types of sub-creators and undermines the traditional preconceptions of how imaginary worlds can be built, inhabited and developed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958528774

Philosophers are still not able to reach agreement, and have come to a deadlock, since all possible approaches seem to have been exhausted and all the arguments repeatedly discussed. Problem: It may be assumed that the crisis has been caused by factors rooted in initial, wrong attitudes to knowledge or, more specifically, in epistemology focused on first-order cybernetics. The situation might be altered if philosophy of consciousness can be refocused on second-order cybernetics. This means that any attempt to apply the subject-object model to consciousness and specifically to reflection should be given up, while consciousness should not be seen as a certain objective essence observable by a researcher. It also means that the principles underlying theories of consciousness should be revised: Any attempts that aim to explain the mechanism of generating consciousness through non-consciousness should be abandoned. The purpose of this article is methodological, pointing out the approaches to studying consciousness that might be more effective. It also gives the author's vision of a new way of treating consciousness, taking into account the stated methodology. Method: Theoretical conceptual methods of argumentation, such as logical (deduction) and philosophical (phenomenology) kinds of proof. Results: The research shows that the epistemology underlying second-order cybernetics can eliminate many of the paradoxes typical of present-day theories of consciousness that are related to different versions of reductionism. It also explains that, in contrast to the dualistic subject-object model used for description of consciousness, the latter can and should be seen as a strictly self-describing system, where the diversity of forms and states is explained by inherent differences.

This juxtaposition is examined from a viewpoint of ""academic capitalism"" and ""transnational capitalist class"" theories, both of which are skeptical towards globalization. The aim of the analysis is to determine the causes of such a positioning of scientists within the community. The main hypothesis of the article is that the key premise of this conflict is divergence of interests between scientists, aiming to improve their situation by increasing the flow of state resources, and researchers prioritizing participation in global science, which is dependent on connections with its infrastructure including world class universities, transnational corporations, and supranational organizations providing financial support of research. The article offers an overview of the international development of science in the period from the late 1940s till the current decade. It accentuates the following milestones: The emergence of a distinct division between basic and applied science in the decade following World War Two, an explosive growth of higher education in the 1950-60s, reforms of intellectual property regulations and university funding in the 1980s; a realignment in relations between state and university in the 1990s. The article also considers a number of cases, which allow to determine the causes leading to the division of the scientific community into fractions representing diverging interests. Among them are the following: The problem of participation in English-language scientific press for researchers from non-Englishspeaking countries; development of world class universities in countries with strong scientific traditions differing from the American tradition, which dominates the global research space; collision of interests between national and supranational levels of research funding in Europe. The main conclusion made based on these cases is that the emergence of fractions in the scientific community is closely connected to wider social-economic contradictions, first of all those arising between globally and locally oriented social groups.","Academic capitalism; European research council; National science foundations; Science policy; Scientific community; World class universities",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015610360

To test whether early-formed experience related to skin sensations, olfaction and taste differs from later-formed experience related to vision and hearing, we asked Russian-speaking participants to categorize or to assess the pleasantness of experience mentally reactivated by sense-related adjectives found in common dictionaries. It was found that categorizing adjectives in relation to vision, hearing and skin sensations took longer than categorizing adjectives in relation to olfaction and taste. In addition, experience described by adjectives predominantly related to vision, hearing and skin sensations took more time for the pleasantness judgment and generated less intense emotions than that described by adjectives predominantly related to olfaction and taste. Interestingly the dynamics of skin resistance corresponded to the intensity and pleasantness of reported emotions. We also found that sense-related experience described by early-acquired adjectives took less time for the pleasantness judgment and generated more intense and more positive emotions than that described by later-acquired adjectives. Correlations were found between the time of the pleasantness judgment of experience, intensity and pleasantness of reported emotions, age of acquisition, frequency, imageability and length of sense-related adjectives. All in all these findings support the hypothesis that early-formed experience is less differentiated than later-formed experience. © 2016 Kolbeneva, Alexandrov.

This article examines legacies of state formation spatially, by looking at variation within “frontier” states—countries that in recent centuries have extended rule over new territories adjacent to their core regions. Frontier zones are found to have ongoing lower levels of public order and deficient public goods provision. Several theories are examined to explain this discrepancy, including internal resettlement, costs of monitoring and enforcement, and the relationship between settlers and the indigenous population. It is argued that the formation of strong social institutions among settlers leads to resistance to attempts to impose governance over frontier regions, and to “select for” lower fiscal capacity and lower provision of public goods. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952361991

There exist numerous sources of uncertainties that may result in time overruns possibly leading to multiple negative consequences. Our experience in planning this work suggests that accepting the stochastic nature of the project duration is a constructive step towards the preparedness to contingencies and defining penalties for repair companies. To support this approach, one needs to construct probability distributions of the durations of the projects. To address the issue of the scarcity of observed data, we suggest using a bootstrap resampling procedure. Gram-Charlier functions and order statistics are employed to approximate the distributions. It is demonstrated how to derive them for a separate repair project and a larger project consisting of a number of concurrently running subprojects. Following this, guidance is provided on how to decide about what duration should define the deadline for completion of the whole work.

Cross-cultural tests imply that the most important obstacles to tropical Africa’s fertility transition are (a) a high ideal family size, (b) a large potential to absorb increases in the female labor force participation rate without any substantial decreases in fertility due to ample child care readily available through extended family structures, (c) a large potential to increase fertility at the early stages of economic development through the abolition of postpartum sex taboos, and (d) a low potential for increases in birth spacing to contribute to fertility decline. In the last section, we discuss how the results obtained could be useful for policy recommendations aimed at accelerating the fertility decline in tropical Africa, and mitigating the forecasts of explosive population growth. © 2016, © 2016 SAGE Publications.","agriculture; demographic transition; family; female contribution to subsistence; fertility; polygyny; postpartum sex taboos; tropical Africa",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973452378

Using the voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we calculated the volumes of gray and white matter in the whole brain and in selected areas. The results showed that a common feature of different age and sex groups performing the TS was bilateral activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal areas, the inferior parietal lobes and the inferior occipital gyrus. We also found a transition from local to diffuse activation occurring with age. In young men (20 to 30 years of age) compared to women, a greater increase in the BOLD signal was found in the prefrontal areas bilaterally, the right parietal lobe and insula, and, in addition, bilateral activation in the supplementary motor area which were not observed in women.

An orthogonal pair in a simple Lie algebra is a pair of Cartan subalgebras that are orthogonal with respect to the Killing form. The description of orthogonal pairs in a given Lie algebra is an important step in the classification of orthogonal decompositions, i.e., decompositions of the Lie algebra into a direct sum of Cartan subalgebras pairwise orthogonal with respect to the Killing form. One of the important notions of quantum mechanics, quantum information theory, and quantum teleportation is the notion of mutually unbiased bases in the Hilbert space ℂ n . Two orthonormal bases {e i } i = 1 n , {f j } j = 1 n are mutually unbiased if and only if|&amp;#x2329;ei|fj&amp;#x232A;|2=1nfor any i, j = 1,…, n. The notions of mutually unbiased bases in ℂ n and orthogonal pairs in sl(n) are closely related. The problem of classification of orthogonal pairs in sl(n) and the closely related problem of classification of mutually unbiased bases in ℂ n are still open even for the case n = 6. In this article, we give a sketch of our proof that there is a complex four-dimensional family of orthogonal pairs in sl(6). This proof requires a lot of algebraic geometry and representation theory. Further, we give an application of the result on the algebraic geometric family to the study of mutually unbiased bases.

The analysis builds on authors-compiled cross-national dataset on 185 countries over the time period of twenty years, from 1990 to 2010. We find that, first, nation's intelligence reduces significantly the level of deforestation in a state. Moreover, the nations' IQ seems to play an offsetting role in the natural resource conservation (forest management) in the countries with weak democratic institutions. The analysis also discovered the presence of the U-shaped relationship between democracy and deforestation. Intelligence sheds more light on this interconnection and explains the results.

After reporting initial evidence for the potential causal effects of values on desired emotions in a preliminary study (N = 200), we tested the predictions of our proposed model in 8 samples (N = 2,328) from distinct world cultural regions. Across cultural samples, we found that people who endorsed values of self-transcendence (e.g., benevolence) wanted to feel more empathy and compassion, people who endorsed values of self-enhancement (e.g., power) wanted to feel more anger and pride, people who endorsed values of openness to change (e.g., self-direction) wanted to feel more interest and excitement, and people who endorsed values of conservation (e.g., tradition) wanted to feel more calmness and less fear.

At baseline, incongruent audio-visual pairings decreased performance, demonstrating dependence of emotion while perceiving ambiguous faces.

An example of such a phenomenon is the dynamical Lamb effect, which is the parametric excitation of an atom due to nonadiabatic modulation of its Lamb shift. This effect was initially introduced for a natural atom in a varying cavity, while we suggest its realization in a superconducting qubit-cavity system with dynamically tunable coupling. In the present paper, we study the interplay between the dynamical Lamb effect and the energy dissipation, which is unavoidable in realistic systems. We find that despite naive expectations, this interplay can lead to unexpected dynamical regimes. One of the most striking results is that photon generation from vacuum can be strongly enhanced due to qubit relaxation, which opens another channel for such a process. We also show that dissipation in the cavity can increase the qubit excited-state population. Our results can be used for experimental observation and investigation of the dynamical Lamb effect and accompanying quantum effects. © 2016 American Physical Society.",,"Energy dissipation; Quantum computers; Quantum electronics; Timing circuits; Cavity QED phenomena; Dynamical regime; Parametric excitations; Photon generation; Realistic systems; Superconducting circuit; Superconducting quantum circuit; Superconducting qubits; Excited states","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977072783

There are many measures that allow to evaluate a topological importance of nodes of the network. Unfortunately, most of them cannot be applied to large networks due to their high computational complexity. However, if we narrow the initial network and apply these centrality measures to the sparse network, it is possible that the obtained set of central nodes will be similar to the set of central nodes in large networks. If these sets are similar, the centrality measures with a high computational complexity can be used for central nodes detection in large networks. To check the idea, several random networks were generated and different techniques of network reduction were considered.

Further serious challenges for biofuels are that the average consumer (1) does not place additional value to the availability of different types of fuels and (2) does not yet accept paying more for biofuel with lower levels of pollutant emission. The increased use of biofuels hinges on the confluence of a variety of policies, such as energy, agricultural, environmental and industrial policies. This chapter juxtaposes the innovation systems for ethanol in Brazil and the United States, the two major global producers, evaluating their main strengths and weaknesses. Emphasis is placed on the coordination of energy policy with industrial and agricultural policies, environmental aspects and regulation. The chapter concludes with a general comparison of the two countries regarding the development of second-generation ethanol technologies (E2G). Brazil has a better structured market for ethanol use. However, the system shows significant inertia in terms of wide-scale adoption of E2G production technology. The United States has difficulties with market formation, but has taken a well-articulated set of actions to develop technology. A large part of technological development in the United States is done by startups with technologies often found in university research laboratories. In Brazil, technology development is dominated by research institutes and large firms. The technological evolution of E2G, intercropped with a raw material of high productivity (sugarcane), has the potential to make biofuels price competitive with fossil fuels. Despite the deep differences in terms of policy systems supporting innovation between the two countries, the results in terms of industrial production are quite close and indicate that both systems present conditions to transition to E2G. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The current study uses the Visual World Paradigm (VWP) to assess its feasibility to study retrieval interference arising from distractors present in a visual display during spoken language comprehension. The study aims to extend findings from Van Dyke and McElree (2006), which utilized a dual-task paradigm with written sentences in which they manipulated the relationship between extra-sentential distractors and the semantic retrieval cues from a verb, to the spoken modality. Results indicate that retrieval interference effects do occur in the spoken modality, manifesting immediately upon encountering the verbal retrieval cue for inaccurate trials when the distractors are present in the visual field. We also observed indicators of repair processes in trials containing semantic distractors, which were ultimately answered correctly. We conclude that the VWP is a useful tool for investigating retrieval interference effects, including both the online effects of distractors and their after-effects, when repair is initiated.

The purpose of this paper is to look at future developments of Russian science from the perspective of recent policies and their perceptions by Russian scientists. Special emphasis is placed on the so-called “efficient contracts” policy for researchers which should make the remuneration system of public R&D organisations more competitive. Design/methodology/approach: The paper examines the results of an extensive survey of almost 1,500 Russian scientists and managers at universities and public research organisations conducted by the authors in 2013 and recent statistical data and policy documents. Findings: The paper concludes that some of the ambitious science and technology goals set by the government will be hard to achieve in the next decade. The scientific landscape is likely to experience certain structural changes but will probably face many of the existing problems. Improvements in overall R&D performance will largely depend on how well the “efficient contracts” policy is implemented.

Five key questions are addressed concerning the skills and abilities of PhD holders: What competencies do researchers have at present? What competencies are currently used? How valuable are they at the present time? Will they be in demand in 10-15 years? And how relevant are these competencies for working on projects in priority areas of science and technology development? Design/methodology/approach: The analysis was based on data collected by two empirical studies conducted in 2010-2013. A survey of researchers and engineers described the issues with competencies related to the areas of science, technology and innovation. Study among 1,884 PhD holders employed in research institutes, universities and enterprises was carried out. In addition, 30 in-depth interviews were also conducted with experts representing the most promising areas of science and technology development in Russia – nanotechnology, biotechnology and the power engineering sectors. Findings: The results from quantitative and qualitative analyses indicate that general competencies such as fundamental theoretical knowledge, ability to work on projects, teamwork and creativity will be in demand in 10-15 years, rather than highly specialized skills.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper first reviews the evolution of the R&I landscape and identifies the most influential stakeholders engaged in R&I. In the light of the scenarios developed for the year 2030, a set of strategic options are identified and assessed for each stakeholder group. Findings: R&I systems are now more complex than 50 years ago and will be even more in the future. Radical changes are expected in terms of the ways research is funded, organised and carried out. Some of these transformations are captured by the scenarios developed. The analysis of scenarios indicated that their feasibility and desirability differ across different sectors of industry, and research areas within the research landscape. Research limitations/implications: Scenarios and strategies presented in the paper bring new considerations on the way research activities are practiced. Further research is considered to be useful on the new modes of research and implications for academia, industry, society and policy makers. Practical implications: The discussion around the responses of different stakeholders vis-à-vis specific scenarios about the future in R&I practices and organisation gives a practical view about how to deal with associated emerging trends and issues. Social implications: Society is a crucial stakeholder of all R&I activities. The transformative scenarios suggest that society will not only be playing a reactive role on the demand side but also more proactive role on the supply side in the decades to come. Originality/value: The paper is based on work undertaken within the Research and Innovation (RIF) 2030 project.

We obtain that at frequencies lower than Fermi energy the metallic response in a BDS film manifests in the existence of surface-plasmon polaritons, but at higher frequencies the dielectric response is dominated and it occurs that a BDS film behaves as a dielectric waveguide. At this dielectric regime we predict the existence inside a BDS film of novel electromagnetic modes, a 3D analog of the transverse electric waves in graphene. We also find that the dielectric response manifests as the wide-angle passband in the mid-infrared (IR) transmission spectrum of light incident on a BDS film, which can be used for the interferenceless omnidirectional mid-IR filtering. The tuning of the Fermi level of the system allows us to switch between the metallic and the dielectric regimes and to change the frequency range of the predicted modes.

The Louvain algorithm is used to detect communities of co-commenting. Cosine similarity and topic modeling based on latent Dirichlet allocation are applied to study topical coherence within these communities. Findings – Bloggers unite into moderately manifest communities by commenting roughly the same sets of posts. The graph of co-commenting is sparse and connected by a minority of active non-top commenters.

The article is divided into two parts. The first part provides a brief historical overview of the codes of conduct in prerevolutionary and Soviet school policy and practice. The body of evidence that we consider includes resolutions of the Soviet government, Soviet regulations about schooling, as well as the corpus of codes of conduct for Soviet schools stretching from the 1930s to the 1980s. The history of codes of conduct in the Soviet school system can be told in several stages: an initial period of complete rejection of all codes of conduct (1917–27), a period of gradual legitimation through the issuance of government resolutions (1927–35), a transitional period of waiting for the adoption of regulations promised by government resolution (1935–43), a decade (1943–54) during which all requirements were based on the “Code for Students,” adopted in 1943, and finally a gradual transition period when disciplinary functions became subject to uniform requirements (1954–72). The “Code for Students” promulgated in 1943 differed from a similar set of rules issued in 1874 as the former sought to construct an ideal image of the Soviet school and student. The fact that the new “Code” came to play a largely symbolic function meant that it lost its ability to actually regulate school discipline on a day-to-day basis. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017562697

The article seeks to answer the question: how does kindergarten reconcile emotionality with formal rules and regulations, and how does this affect the structure of kindergarten as an organization? The features of bureaucratic and feminist organizations that form the basis of kindergarten are analyzed using the organizational concept of “organized dissonance” proposed by Karen Ashcraft. The bureaucratic organization and form of organized dissonance are compared across such properties as the organization’s primary goal, power structure, functional rules, division of labor, status of/qualifications for hiring and promotion, as well as ideal member relations. In order to answer the question of what the relationship between formal rules and emotionality in kindergarten is, we used participant observation data from a kindergarten in Moscow between April 2 and May 12, 2012 as part of a teaching internship. Field diary entries and official documents from the kindergarten were analyzed as part of the study. The obtained data were analyzed using open and axial coding.

However, the exact mechanism responsible for the formation of navigation properties remained unknown. We show that navigability can be achieved by using only two ingredients present in the majority of networks: network growth and local homophily, giving a persuasive answer how the navigation appears in real-life networks. A very simple algorithm produces hierarchical self-similar optimally wired navigable small world networks with exponential degree distribution by using only local information. Adding preferential attachment produces a scale-free network which has shorter greedy paths, but worse (power law) scaling of the information extraction locality (algorithmic complexity of a search). Introducing saturation of the preferential attachment leads to truncated scale-free degree distribution that offers a good tradeoff between these parameters and can be useful for practical applications. Several features of the model are observed in real-life networks, in particular in the brain neural networks, supporting the earlier suggestions that they are navigable. © 2016 Malkov, Ponomarenko.

The author comes to the following conclusions. 1) The EAEU complies with canons formed by the EU and is being built with due regard to the European integration experience. The common external tariff, the ""four freedoms"" of the internal market and principles of its organization - the prohibition of discrimination, harmonization, mutual recognition of standards, conformity mark, common sectoral policies, logic of neofunctionalism - all these regulation elements are present in both models. 2) Russia considers cooperation with the EU as positive, because it has gained regulation methods for the traditionally controlled market and strengthened its global position due to this cooperation. 3) The EU makes a significant indirect impact on the Eurasian integration through criticism and expansion of peculiar approaches. Part of the criticism is of temporary or politicized character. 4) The EAEU has a strong starting idea - common history, common genetics and the need to preserve achievements in exploration and development of the vast Eurasian space. 5) An opportunity for interaction between the EU and the EAEU derives from the convergence of regulatory systems. However, high degree of state participation in economies of the EAEU countries, which distinguishes the Eurasian model from the European one and has become an irritant in the EU-EAEU relations, will continue to hinder ""the integration of integrations"".","Eurasian Economic Union; European Union; Freedom of movement; Harmonization; Integration of integrations; Neofunctionalism; Protectionism; Single internal market",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002546596

Using this process and the conventional pricing kernel framework, we derive double recursive formulas for computing the affine coefficients for the term structure of interest rate spread. The estimated model counterpart, which is based on the pre-EMU interest rate spread data for the interest rates of the German mark and Italian lira, fits the data reasonably well and captures the stylized empirical facts. Namely, spreads for all maturities have downward trends, and the longer the maturity is, the less spread there is. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Brownian bridge; monetary union; Pricing kernel; yield curve","convergence; interest rate; monetary union; numerical model; pricing policy","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961211083

We investigated the spatio-temporal dynamics of neural access to word representations in the brain by scrutinising the brain's activity elicited in response to psycholinguistically, visually and phonologically matched groups of familiar words and meaningless pseudowords. Stimuli were briefly presented on the visual-field periphery to experimental participants whose attention was occupied with a non-linguistic visual feature-detection task. The neural activation elicited by these unattended orthographic stimuli was recorded using multi-channel whole-head magnetoencephalography, and the timecourse of lexically-specific neuromagnetic responses was assessed in sensor space as well as at the level of cortical sources, estimated using individual MR-based distributed source reconstruction. Our results demonstrate a neocortical signature of automatic near-instant access to word representations in the brain: activity in the perisylvian language network characterised by specific activation enhancement for familiar words, starting as early as ∼70 ms after the onset of unattended word stimuli and underpinned by temporal and inferior-frontal cortices.",,"adult; brain mapping; female; human; language; magnetoencephalography; male; neocortex; physiology; procedures; spatiotemporal analysis; young adult; Adult; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Language; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Neocortex; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971321397

The high frequency firing within the bursts is attributed to NMDA, but not AMPA receptor activation. In our models of the DA neuron, both biophysical and abstract, the NMDA receptor current can significantly increase their firing frequency, whereas the AMPA receptor current is not able to evoke high-frequency activity and usually suppresses firing. However, both currents are produced by glutamate receptors and, consequently, are often co-activated. Here we consider combined influence of AMPA and NMDA synaptic input in the models of the DA neuron. Different types of neuronal activity (resting state, low frequency, or high frequency firing) are observed depending on the conductance of the AMPAR and NMDAR currents. In two models, biophysical and reduced, we show that the firing frequency increases more effectively if both receptors are co-activated for certain parameter values. In particular, in the more quantitative biophysical model, the maximal frequency is 40% greater than that with NMDAR alone. The dynamical mechanism of such frequency growth is explained in the framework of phase space evolution using the reduced model. In short, both the AMPAR and NMDAR currents flatten the voltage nullcline, providing the frequency increase, whereas only NMDA prevents complete unfolding of the nullcline, providing robust firing. Thus, we confirm a major role of the NMDAR in generating high-frequency firing and conclude that AMPAR activation further significantly increases the frequency. © 2016 Zakharov, Lapish, Gutkin and Kuznetsov.","AMPA receptors; Dopaminergic neurons; Excitatory stimuli; High frequency activity; NMDA receptors","Biophysics; Chemical activation; Phase space methods; AMPA-receptor; Dopaminergic neurons; Excitatory stimuli; High frequency HF; NMDA receptor; Neurons; AMPA receptor; dopamine; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; Article; channel gating; controlled study; dopaminergic nerve cell; feedback system; firing rate; nerve cell membrane conductance; protein analysis; protein function; protein protein interaction; resting state network; signal transduction; spike wave","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973322982

Restricted access (private) groups play an important role in the formation of neighbors' communities of trust and, supposedly, can be useful substitutes of face-to-face interaction for people moving into new buildings. Open (public) groups function as public forums for fostering neighbors' cooperation and attracting attention of broader public to local issues and conflicts. ©2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Citizen engagement; Community-oriented social media; Computer-mediated communication; Local social media; Place-based communties; Urban communities","Apartment houses; Citizen engagements; Computer mediated communication; Place-based; Social media; Urban community; Social networking (online)","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976438533

We formulate a modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory, using the formalism of density functional approach on the level of local density approximation taking into account the electrostatic interactions of ions and co-solvent molecules as well as their excluded volume. We derive the modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation, considering the three-component symmetric lattice gas model as a reference system and minimizing the grand thermodynamic potential with respect to the electrostatic potential. We apply present modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation to the electric double layer theory, showing that accounting for the excluded volume of co-solvent molecules and ions slightly changes the main result of our previous simplified theory. Namely, in the case of small co-solvent polarizability with its increase under the enough small surface potentials of electrode, the differential capacitance undergoes the significant growth. Oppositely, when the surface potential exceeds some threshold value (which is slightly smaller than the saturation potential), the increase in the co-solvent polarizability results in a differential capacitance decrease. However, when the co-solvent polarizability exceeds some threshold value, its increase generates a considerable enhancement of the differential capacitance in a wide range of surface potentials. We demonstrate that two qualitatively different behaviors of the differential capacitance are related to the depletion and adsorption of co-solvent molecules at the charged electrode. We show that an additive of the strongly polarizable co-solvent to an electrolyte solution can shift significantly the saturation potential in two qualitatively different manners. Namely, a small additive of strongly polarizable co-solvent results in a shift of saturation potential to higher surface potentials. On the contrary, a sufficiently large additive of co-solvent shifts the saturation potential to lower surface potentials. We obtain that an increase in the co-solvent polarizability makes the electrostatic potential profile longer-ranged. However, increase in the co-solvent concentration in the bulk leads to non-monotonic behavior of the electrostatic potential profile. An increase in the co-solvent concentration in the bulk at its sufficiently small values makes the electrostatic potential profile longer-ranged. Oppositely, when the co-solvent concentration in the bulk exceeds some threshold value, its further increase leads to decrease in electrostatic potential at all distances from the electrode. © 2016 Author(s).",,"Boltzmann equation; Capacitance; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrostatics; Local density approximation; Molecules; Poisson equation; Polarization; Surface potential; Density-functional approach; Differential capacitance; Electric double layer; Electrolyte solutions; Electrostatic potentials; Poisson-Boltzmann equations; Poisson-Boltzmann theory; Thermodynamic potentials; Solvents","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969663927

Abnormalities in the arcuate have been reported in young children with ASC, mostly in low-functioning or non-verbal individuals, but little is known regarding the structural properties of the arcuate in adults with ASC or, in particular, in individuals with ASC who have intact language, such as those with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome. We used probabilistic tractography of diffusion-weighted imaging to isolate and scrutinize the arcuate in a mixed-gender sample of 18 high-functioning adults with ASC (17. Asperger syndrome) and 14 age-and IQ-matched typically developing controls. Arcuate volume was significantly reduced bilaterally with clearest differences in the right hemisphere. This finding remained significant in an analysis of all male participants alone. Volumetric reduction in the arcuate was significantly correlated with the severity of autistic symptoms as measured by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient. These data reveal that structural differences are present even in high-functioning adults with ASC, who presented with no clinically manifest language deficits and had no reported developmental language delay. Arcuate structural integrity may be useful as an index of ASC severity and thus as a predictor and biomarker for ASC.

The deeds of two Venetian notaries who worked there during the 1430s, Nicolo de Varsis and Benedetto de Smeritis, are an important source for tracing the transformation of the issues and directions of Italian trade in the Black Sea region, a trade which was recovering from the crisis of the fourteenth century. Notwithstanding the Venetian-Genoese struggle and previous crisis events, this recovery made the economic conditions favourable. Although some scholars see a regionalisation of trade in fifteenth century, the source evidence challenges this interpretation. Westerners began to import Italian, Flemish and English textiles to the Eastern markets, and the local goods (fish, caviar) were widely exported to Europe – even to the markets of Flanders. Finally, the slave trade was intensive.

The paper presents the findings of an empirical study with migrants (N = 378) and residents of Moscow (N = 651) examining their intercultural relations, including their acceptance of multicultural ideology, intercultural contacts, intercultural strategies and mutual adaptation. The study was guided by three general hypotheses: the integration, the multicultural and the contact hypotheses. Data processing was carried out using path analysis, separately for migrants and Muscovites. For both samples, multicultural ideology predicts the strategy of integration positively, and of assimilation negatively. Intercultural contacts predict both acculturation strategies positively for migrants, but not for Muscovites. For migrants, both strategies positively predict life satisfaction, and integration predicts better sociocultural adaptation. For Muscovites, integration predicts life satisfaction. These specific findings fully support the two underlying hypotheses: integration and multicultural for both groups and contact hypothesis only for migrants. Multicultural ideology has positive relation to intercultural contacts of Muscovites and has indirect positive impact on intercultural strategies of migrants. Models demonstrated similar as well as different psychological processes underlying mutual acculturation and intercultural relations in the two groups. The similarities suggest that efforts should be directed at developing a multicultural ideology and facilitating intercultural contacts between migrants and members of the larger society. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Intercultural contact; Intercultural strategies/expectations; Life satisfaction; Migrants; Multicultural ideology; Sociocultural adaptation",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961175536

When education is heavily subsidized and limited in supply (as in India), preferences are welfare reducing.

In both cases, the enumerative information is taken in equivariant K-theory, where the equivariance is with respect to all automorphisms of the problem. In Donaldson-Thomas theory, one sums over all Euler characteristics with a weight (-q)x, where q is a parameter, informally referred to as the boxcounting parameter. The main feature of the correspondence is that the 3-dimensional boxcounting parameter q becomes in dimension 5 the equivariant parameter for the C×-action that defines X inside Z. The 5-dimensional theory effectively sums up the q-expansion in the Donaldson-Thomas theory. In particular, it gives a natural explanation of the rationality (in q) of the DT partition functions. Other expected as well as unexpected symmetries of the DT counts follow naturally from the 5-dimensional perspective. These involve choosing different C×-actions on the same Z, and thus relating the same 5-dimensional theory to different DT problems. The important special case Z = X×C2 is considered in detail in Sections 7 and 8. If X is a toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold, we compute the theory in terms of a certain index vertex. We show that the refined vertex found combinatorially by Iqbal, Kozcaz, and Vafa is a special case of the index vertex. © Foundation Compositio Mathematica 2016.","Donaldson-Thomas theory; M-theory",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020381689

Taking into account the polymer conformational entropy, renormalization of solvent composition near the polymer backbone, the universal intermolecular excluded-volume and van der Waals interactions within the self-consistent field theory, the reentrant coil-to-globule-to-coil transition (co-nonsolvency) has been described in this paper. For convenience we split the system volume in two parts: the volume occupied by the polymer chain and the volume of bulk solution. Considering the equilibrium between two sub-volumes, the polymer solvation free energy as a function of radius of gyration and co-solvent mole fraction within internal polymer volume has been obtained. Minimizing the free energy of solvation with respect to its arguments, we show two qulitatively different regimes of co-nonsolvency. Namely, at sufficiently high temperature the reentrant coil-to-globule-to-coil transition proceeds smoothly. On the contrary, when the temperature drops below a certain threshold value a coil-globule transition occurs in the regime of first-order phase transition, i.e., discontinuous changes of the radius of gyration and the local co-solvent mole fraction near the polymer backbone. We show that, when the collapse of the polymer chain takes place, the entropy and enthalpy contributions to the solvation free energy of the globule strongly grow. From the first principles of statistical thermodynamics we confirm earlier speculations based on the MD simulations results that the co-nonsolvency is the essentially enthalpic-entropic effect and is caused by enthalpy-entropy compensation. We show that the temperature dependences of the solution heat capacity change due to the solvation of the polymer chain are in qualitative agreement with the differential scanning calorimetry data for PNIPAM in aqueous methanol. © CopyrightEPLA, 2016.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84976286759

The mushroom-Type metamaterial surfaces allow solving such tasks as isolation of elements in antenna arrays, multipath mitigating in GNSS systems, reduction of the ground plane edge influence on the directivity of the antenna elements etc. The usage of these structures in the microwave devices design can significantly improve their properties and performance. Structurally mushroom-Type metamaterials are periodic microstrip structures and their properties depend strongly on the parameters of the substrate and the accuracy of manufacturing of the conductive pattern. As these structures have a narrow band gap, expensive materials and high precision technologies should be used for their manufacturing. A method of the mushroom-Type metamaterial band gap electronic readjustment is proposed in this paper. The idea of the method is that a variable-capacitance diode, should be placed between two coupled mushroom hats one terminal of which is grounded for direct current through a metalized via of the metamaterial element, and the other one is connected to a controlled DC voltage source. At the same time the mushroom hats are separated by at least two capacitive gaps, one of which is in parallel with a variable-capacitance diode, which equivalent capacitance is determined by the DC voltage of the controlled source. The design of a band gap metamaterial-based frequency selective surface with an electronic readjustment of the working band, and the results of its numerical modeling, which show the working band frequency movement while the changing of the lumped elements capacitance are presented.

Design/methodology/approach – The research uses partial least squares techniques applied to a sample of 113 SMEs of wood industry in Oberá, Argentina. Findings – SMEs in subsistence clusters can use relational capital and territory as resources to generate competitive advantages. These competitive advantages foster performance. In consequence, collective efficiency appears as growth strategy in subsistence SMEs.

Sample is in a particular region and sector and generalizations should be done carefully. Practical implications – SMEs probably should integrate and share industrial and business structures to develop systemic competitive advantages with a collective character. SMEs should leverage their spatial interaction to build trust and establish networks of cooperation that will be the source of their collective efficiency. These collaboration networks should base in the local knowledge. Social implications – Subsistence SMEs have strong impact on the most disadvantaged areas in developing countries.

Quantitative and qualitative analyses are applied to derive an understanding of the targets of competition policy in the practice of enforcement. Findings – The analysis reveals that the majority of cases would never be investigated under conventional understanding of the goals of antitrust enforcement. It is also shown that antitrust authorities tend to investigate cases that require less input but result in infringement decisions with lower probability of being annulled and lower cost to proceed. Structure of enforcement is skewed toward cases where harm serves as independent and sufficient evidence of competition law violation.

We found several types of water channels, where this mechanism can be realized, including (i) channels with a monotonically decreasing cross-section (normal dispersion), (ii) an inland basin described by a half of elliptic paraboloid (abnormal dispersion) and (iii) an underwater hill described by a half of hyperbolic paraboloid (normal dispersion).

Design/methodology/approach – The authors use an instrumental variables approach to estimate vocational education’s relative academic effectiveness in terms of achievement on an international test, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Program of International Student Assessment (PISA), and two possible indicators of non-cognitive outcomes – self-efficacy in mathematics and intrinsic motivation in mathematics, both also available from the PISA student survey. Findings – The results show few, if any, differences in student gains from attending the vocational track in secondary school as opposed to the academic track. Specifically, the results show that attending the vocational or academic track results in similar achievement gains in the tenth grade and generally similar gains in self-efficacy and motivation in mathematics. Originality/value – The study is unique because in the three countries, the authors can use a fuzzy regression discontinuity approach based on school systems’ age entrance date rules to estimate the gain in test scores over an academic year and to compare the gain for students in the vocational and academic tracks. The results contradict almost all other studies by showing that in these countries student academic gains in vocational education are about the same as in the academic track. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Disadvantaged groups; Education; Learning organizations; Public policy",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961659747

This theory deals with the four basic market structures, namely that of free competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly and monopoly, with a common evolutionary pattern from competition to monopoly. However, contemporary technological competition has engendered a brand-new type of market structure. Some key features of it are outlined in the article with the stress on contemporary trends in network market development that have arisen under the influence of digitalization. The traditional approach to network market is through escalation effect, when network spillovers exist either in technology or in demand, and companies or IT platforms should gain a benchmark mass of clients, as fast as possible, in order to have the whole market. All other consumers have tendency to buy the leader's product; thus, the market becomes a natural monopoly of the leader (at least, natural oligopoly). With the advancement in ICT technology, especially with digitalization, a new configuration of network market structure is being developed. Niche players are gaining their positions. It is arisen a multiple offer of ICT products. Market is becoming more and more fragmented. Network products evolve from substitutes into complements. The market drives from natural monopoly (oligopoly) into a very competitive structure. The author examines the mechanisms and results of network market transformation in contemporary digital era. Unlike the previous period when network services were provided separately, the newest tendencies, starting from TV, demonstrate that the frontiers among network markets become blurred, the separation between markets and particular ICT products vanishes/So far, the formerly independent network markets are being transformed into shapeless segments of a single and indivisible multimedia area. In this integrated area any ICT provider obtains an opportunity to successfully compete with any other. The differences between various electronic devices, between ICT, broadcasting and address services, and even non-ICT products disappear. Network market evolves from a very concentrated and monopolized structure into a fragmented competitive industry with tough price competition. This brand new structure could be titled as concentric (ring) market, or a center-periphery model. The relationships within it mean unknown possibilities and challenges both for market participants and governments. © 2016 Russian Academy of Sciences.","Industrial economics; Industrial organization; Market structures; Network competition; Network market",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032891050

He also performs another task-such as carrying out economic policy. The dictator's decision each period is whether to hire a subordinate who is competent or incompetent at that task. An unemployed subordinate may be hired in the future, when the current dictator is removed from office. I show that less competent subordinates will be more loyal. As a result, dictators who value performance at economic tasks will hire more competent subordinates and will have shorter tenures. Incompetent subordinates will be hired more often if the dictators discount future payoffs less heavily or if the payoff from competence is smaller. The results show that, consistent with observation, longer tenures will not be associated with better economic performance. © 2015 by the Southern Political Science Association.

The results derive from a single-case thematic and functionalist study of the popular Russian TV series Glukhar' (which aired from 2008 to 2011). The show merits special attention because it was on air when the Russian police were undergoing a legitimacy crisis, which lead to the 2009 police reform. The series recognized the crisis and responded to it with a set of justifications. I analyze the show's social and cultural contexts, its plot patterns, and the functions of its characters. I build a typology of justifications and claim that the show justifies the police through an open discussion about the reasons for and consequences of their lawlessness. The series shows that the legitimacy of the police is repeatedly questioned, but trust in the police is always restored because police officers are depicted as estranged from the state but not from the community. Thus, the show contains an interesting example of overcoming a legitimacy crisis through its recognition. The study opens the floor to further discussions about how popular culture resolves intense social debates about policing by symbolic means in a moment when police legitimacy is contested. © 2016 SAGE Publications.","Legitimacy; Police; Representation; Russia; TV series",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962427525

References to the second law of thermodynamics in economics within the context of scarcity ignore the fact that the earth is not an isolated system. The earth interacts with external sources and sinks of entropy and the resulting total entropy fluctuates around a constant. Even if the mankind finally proves unable to recycle industrial waste and close the technological cycle, the economic disruption caused by the depletion of natural resources may happen while the total thermodynamic entropy of the ecosystem remains essentially at the present level, because the transfer of chemically refined products may not increase significantly the total entropy, but it may decrease their recyclability.The inutility of industrial waste is not connected with its entropy, which may be exemplified with the case of alumina production. The case also demonstrates that industrially generated entropy is discharged into surroundings without being accumulated in 'thermodynamically unavailable matter'.Material entropy, as a measure of complexity and economic dispersal of resources, can be a recyclability metric, but it is not a thermodynamic parameter, and its growth is not equivalent to the growth of thermodynamic entropy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Bayer process; Economic scarcity; Entropy; Recyclability; Red mud; Second law of thermodynamics","Alumina; Economics; Entropy; Thermodynamics; Alumina production; Bayer process; Recyclability; Red mud; Refined products; Second Law of Thermodynamics; Thermodynamic entropy; Thermodynamic parameter; Industrial economics; complexity; economic activity; economics; entropy; industrial waste; mud; natural resource; recycling; red soil; thermodynamics","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962176190

Next, it is shown that the probability of being admitted to the most selective HEIs is determined not only by the USE scores, but by characteristics that are not directly related to the applicants' abilities, such as class specialisation in secondary schools, and high school location. Moreover, we have found that income has an indirect impact on the admission results: a higher level of income increases the probability of being admitted to highly selective universities through the level of investment in pre-entry coaching and the regional differences in wages. On the other hand, regional differences in costs of living decrease the opportunities of studying in selective universities.

Participants were further classified into different types of perfectionists-adaptive, maladaptive, and non-perfectionists-using latent profile analysis. As expected, maladaptive perfectionists reported higher levels of both anxiety and depressive mood compared to adaptive perfectionists; however the stress level between these two types of perfectionists was not significantly different. Cultural contexts, practical implications, and future directions were also discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Anxiety; Depression; Perfectionism; Psychometric properties; Russia",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952926905

We consider the basic stages of contextual multi-armed bandit algorithms during which the probabilistic distributions of each state are evaluated to evaluate the current knowledge of the states, and the decision space is explored to increase the decision-making efficiency. We propose a new decision-making method, which uses the probabilistic neural network to classify abnormal situation and the softmax rule to explore the decision space.

Hirooka. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Based on the statistical data on the number of patents, the amount of investment and savings, levels of production and GDP, we will explore the correlation between innovation process, technological change and economic growth. In this study, econometrical analysis of time-series and spectral-temporal analysis with Wigner-Ville distribution are used as research method. Findings: The study found that the required correlation could be represented as Hirooka's cascade model; also, the manner of this correlation was determined. The expanded cascade model augmented by investment flows is proposed to describe the dynamics of macroeconomic development; it consists of a system of differential equations. The findings support the hypothesis of J. Schumpeter and G. Mensch about the evolutionary nature of economic development. A mathematical model of innovation dynamics was suggested, which describes cyclic asynchronous fluctuations in the GDP index against the trend and allows for predicting with a high accuracy the dynamics of the macro-indicator in the short term, as well as for estimating the nearest crisis occurrence timelines. We suppose this result to be of the utmost importance from a practical point of view as it enables to develop economy policy in accordance with upcoming changes.

These random prices depend on “a state of nature” determined by the initial chance move according to a probability distribution that is known to both players. Player 1 (insider) is aware of the state of nature, but Player 2 is not. Player 2 knows that Player 1 is an insider. The bids may take any integer values. The n-step model is reduced to a zero-sum repeated game with incomplete information of Player 2. It is shown that, if the liquidation prices of shares have finite variances, then the value sequence of n-step games is bounded. This property makes it reasonable to consider the bidding of unlimited duration. The solutions of the corresponding infinite-duration games are constructed. By analogy with the case of two risky assets (see [9]), the optimal strategy of Player 1 induces a random walk of the transaction prices.

It is along these lines that one can speak about the performative life of the contemporary author, about the ""behavior that is to be found within a non-playful art form, in which the typical type of conventional professional language does not imply (or rather, until the relevant time period, did not imply) the appearance of the creator, who by his presence relativizes the very value, durability, uniqueness, and self-sufficiency of the language of the objects he made."" It is from this perspective that the author discusses the overarching meaning of Prigov's oeuvre as the grandiose mockery of societal cultural practices rather than a collection of self-sufficient works. This approach also elucidates Prigov's programmatic self-modeling as the trickster who can only fulfill the performative as the central category of contemporary culture. © 2016 The Russian Review.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962464693

To study the current state of radiology security, we explored the worldwide security of medical image archives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the DICOM data-transmitting standard, we implemented a highly parallel application to scan the entire World Wide Web of networked computers and devices, locating open and unprotected radiology servers. We used only legal and radiology-compliant tools. Our security-probing application initiated a standard DICOM handshake to remote computer or device addresses, and then assessed their security posture on the basis of handshake replies. RESULTS: The scan discovered a total of 2774 unprotected radiology or DICOM servers worldwide. Of those, 719 were fully open to patient data communications. Geolocation was used to analyze and rank our findings according to country utilization. As a result, we built maps and world ranking of clinical security, suggesting that even the most radiology-advanced countries have hospitals with serious security gaps. CONCLUSION: Despite more than two decades of active development and implementation, our radiology data still remains insecure. The results provided should be applied to raise awareness and begin an earnest dialogue toward elimination of the problem. The application we designed and the novel scanning approach we developed can be used to identify security breaches and to eliminate them before they are compromised. © American Roentgen Ray Society.","DICOM; Firewall; Networking; Pacs; Security","Article; computer security; computer system; digital imaging and communications in medicine; e-mail; human; measurement accuracy; patient coding; priority journal; radiology department; web browser; algorithm; Internet; organization and management; radiology department; radiology information system; standards; Algorithms; Computer Security; Internet; Radiology Department, Hospital; Radiology Information Systems; Security Measures","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962359314

The quantitative findings are based on a comparison between employees in 37 Russian companies who participated in corporate volunteering (N = 399) and those who did not (N = 402). Using binary logistic regression analysis, we demonstrate that employee participation in corporate volunteering is positively related to four forms of civic engagement outside the workplace: informal volunteering, formal volunteering, formal monetary donation, and informal monetary donation. In addition, we draw on information obtained from interviews with 10 corporate volunteers, as well as with all 37 company corporate volunteering managers, to develop a general explanation for why corporate volunteering might lead to civic engagement. We identify three primary explanations. First, trust in companies can be converted into increased trust in social institutions. Second, corporate volunteering can expose employees to other realities, thereby leading them to rethink their priorities. Third, corporate volunteering socializes employees to volunteering, thus making them more likely to incorporate volunteering into their personal repertoires of activities.

All the countries studied are internally diverse in their value class composition, and most of them have a non-zero probability to have members of all the five value classes.

Focusing on the decision to hold subnational elections, we argue that autocrats can use local elections to assuage powerful subnational elites. When subnational elites control significant political resources, such as local political machines, leaders may need to co-opt them to govern cost-effectively. Elections are an effective tool of co-optation because they provide elites with autonomy and the opportunity to cultivate their own power bases. We test this argument by analyzing variation in the decision to hold mayoral elections in Russia’s 207 largest cities between 2001 and 2012. Our findings suggest that Russian mayoral elections were more likely to be retained in cities where elected mayors sat atop strong political machines. Our findings also illustrate how subnational elections may actually serve to perpetuate authoritarianism by helping to ensure elite loyalty and putting the resources of powerful elites to work for the regime. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","non-democratic regimes; Russia/former Soviet Union",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959432218

However, functional neuroimaging studies are finding that the right hemisphere also plays a role in diverse language functions. Critically, the right hemisphere may also compensate for the loss or degradation of language functions following extensive stroke-induced damage to the left hemisphere. Here, we review studies that focus on our ability to choose words as we speak. Although fluidly performed in individuals with intact language, this process is routinely compromised in aphasic patients. We suggest that parceling word retrieval into its subprocesses-lexical activation and lexical selection-and examining which of these can be compensated for after left hemisphere stroke can advance the understanding of the lateralization of word retrieval in speech production. In particular, the domain-general nature of the brain regions associated with each process may be a helpful indicator of the right hemisphere's propensity for compensation. © 2016 The New York Academy of Sciences.","Compensatory mechanisms; Hemispheric lateralization; Language production; Stroke-induced aphasia; Word retrieval","aphasia; Article; brain analysis; brain asymmetry; brain damage; brain region; cerebrovascular accident; comprehension; controlled study; executive function; frontal cortex; functional neuroimaging; hemispheric dominance; human; information retrieval; language; learning; left hemisphere; right hemisphere; speech; stroke patient; working memory; brain; cerebrovascular accident; diagnostic imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; Aphasia; Brain; Functional Laterality; Functional Neuroimaging; Humans; Language; Speech; Stroke","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954447835

However, reality may not agree with what is modeled. Conformance checking techniques reveal and diagnose differences between the behavior that is modeled and what is observed. Existing conformance checking approaches tend to focus on the control-flow in a process, while abstracting from data dependencies, resource assignments, and time constraints. Even in those situations when other perspectives are considered, the control-flow is aligned first, i.e., priority is given to this perspective. Data dependencies, resource assignments, and time constraints are only considered as “second-class citizens”, which may lead to misleading conformance diagnostics. For example, a data attribute may provide strong evidence that the wrong activity was executed. Existing techniques will still diagnose the data-flow as deviating, whereas our approach will indeed point out that the control-flow is deviating. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed that balances the deviations with respect to all these perspectives based on a customizable cost function.

We assume that the density inside and outside the tube (and possibly also the cross-section radius) can vary along the tube. This variation is assumed to be of such a form that the kink speed is symmetric with respect to the tube centre and varies monotonically from the tube ends to the tube centre. Then we prove a theorem stating that the ratio of periods of the fundamental mode and first overtone is a monotonically increasing function of the ratio of the kink speed at the tube centre and the tube ends. In particular, it follows from this theorem that the period ratio is lower than two when the kink speed increases from the tube ends to its centre, while it is higher than two when the kink speed decreases from the tube ends to its centre. The first case is typical for non-expanding coronal magnetic loops, and the second for prominence threads. We apply the general results to particular problems. First we consider kink oscillations of coronal magnetic loops. We prove that, under reasonable assumptions, the ratio of the fundamental period to the first overtone is lower than two and decreases when the loop size increases. The second problem concerns kink oscillations of prominence threads. We consider three internal density profiles: generalised parabolic, Gaussian, and Lorentzian. Each of these profiles contain the parameter α that is responsible for its sharpness. We calculate the dependence of the period ratio on the ratio of the mean to the maximum density. For all considered values of α we find that a formula relating the period ratio and the ratio of the mean and maximum density suggested by Soler, Goossens, and Ballester (Astron.

Notwithstanding, in cases of quality issues the process of publishing itself generally used to be accompanied by significant preparative work - research, philological, commentary and philosophically-interpretative work. Vast experience has been accumulated in this sphere. While at the same time, a number of significant philosophic-methodological problems have been revealed. At the center of this problem field lies the question - is there any specificity in the work of publishing preparation of archival philosophical texts? Is the publishing preparation of such a philosophical text differentiated from that of the preparation of any other translated or archival literary work that requires transcription or commentary? Or is this a sphere of exclusively philological work? What is the specificity of philosophical translation and can we represent the archival publication as a type of ""translation""? And so on. Certain answers to these questions define not only the peculiarities of publishing projects and the choice of readership, but also the situation in the intellectual culture of Russia. Therefore it is often surrounded by quite distinct polemics. It is supposed, that an acute necessity of comprehensive discussion of correlated thematics has emerged today. Furthermore the accumulated experience allows the clarification of the practical requirements for publication.","Archive; Commentary; Culture-historical epistemology; Interpretation; Philosophical text; Philosophy and methodology of science; Publication; Reconstruction; Translation",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029897260

Because the Russian system of producing information on causes of death is highly decentralized, there may be discrepancies in the coding practices employed across the country. In this study, we evaluate the uniformity of cause-of-death coding practices across Russian regions using an indirect method. Methods: Based on 2002-2012 mortality data, we estimate the prevalence of the major causes of death (70 causes) in the mortality structures of 52 Russian regions. For each region-cause combination we measured the degree to which the share of a certain cause in the mortality structure of a certain region deviates from the respective inter-regional average share. We use heat map visualization and a regression model to determine whether there is regularity in the causes and the regions that is more likely to deviate from the average level across all regions. In addition to analyzing the comparability of cause-specific mortality structures in a spatial dimension, we examine the regional cause-of-death time series to identify the causes with temporal trends that vary greatly across regions. Results: A high level of consistency was found both across regions and over time for transport accidents, most of the neoplasms, congenital malformations, and perinatal conditions. However, a high degree of inconsistency was found for mental and behavioral disorders, diseases of the nervous system, endocrine disorders, ill-defined causes of death, and certain cardiovascular diseases. This finding suggests that the coding practices for these causes of death are not uniform across regions. The level of consistency improves when causes of death can be grouped into broader diagnostic categories. Conclusion: This systematic analysis allows us to present a broader picture of the quality of cause-of-death coding at the regional level. For some causes of death, there is a high degree of variance across regions in the likelihood that these causes will be chosen as the underlying causes. In addition, for some causes of death the mortality statistics reflect the coding practices, rather than the real epidemiological situation. © 2016 Danilova et al.","Causes of death; Coding; Mortality statistics; Russia; Validation","cause of death; epidemiology; health risk; identification method; model validation; public health; regression analysis; statistical analysis; time series; visualization; accident; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; alcohol liver disease; Article; atherosclerosis; behavior disorder; brain hemorrhage; cause of death; chronic obstructive lung disease; coding; controlled study; cor pulmonale; heart infarction; human; hypertension; ICD-10; mental disease; mortality; prevalence; priority journal; scoring system; senility; stomach cancer; Russian Federation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962609397

The authors view hotel restaurants as having a great potential in the promotion of local gastronomy. Design/methodology/approach – The research was done in several stages. First, the authors selected six destinations (Lapland, Catalonia, Saint Petersburg, Marseille, Parma and Munich) according to the classification of gastronomic brands based on the settlement type. Second, the authors studied conceptions of hotel restaurants located in these destinations to see how they reflect local gastronomic brands. For this purpose, restaurant menus, verbal descriptions of interiors and names of establishments were analyzed using elements of content analysis. Finally, the authors conducted several interviews with hotel managers in one of the destinations to distinguish the challenges of gastronomic branding within hotel restaurants. Findings – The results allowed defining the role of hotel restaurants in gastronomic branding depending on the following factors: hotel’s affiliation with a chain, hotel’s star rating and destination type. Practical implications – The authors argue that gastronomic branding raises attractiveness of hotels, its restaurants and destination on the whole. This research was presented to the Tourism Committee of St Petersburg, resulting in increased attention to gastronomic branding among the city authorities. Originality/value – The role of hotel restaurants in gastronomic branding has not been studied previously. However, hotel restaurants differ from other actors of gastronomic branding due to the necessity to comply with hotel’s conception, brand and standards. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Branding; Destination management; Gastronomic brand; Hotel industry; Restaurants; Tourism","classification; culture; food; hotel industry; tourism; tourism economics; tourism management; tourism market; tourist attraction; tourist destination; Bavaria; Bouches du Rhone; Catalonia; Emilia-Romagna; France; Germany; Italy; Lapland [Eurasia]; Leningrad; Marseilles; Munich; Parma [Emilia-Romagna]; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; Russian Federation; Saint Petersburg; Spain","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959464259

Studying the transition into adulthood is an important resource for understanding the modern times. However, another option is also possible. This concept of transition into adulthood can also be considered as a phenomenon of contemporary culture. The research perspective of cultural sociology, whose methodology is described as structural hermeneutics, can serve these purposes. Structural hermeneutics refers to an analysis of the structure of senses both intersubjective and collectively shared.

Such new and upgraded factories not only target current opportunities and market niches in consumer markets but also aim at exploring possibilities in core industrial markets, including mining equipment, transportation equipment, and other types of industrial equipment. We also highlight the emergence of a new type of industrial project known as “fenced field projects,” which are new manufacturing facilities within the existing industrial sites of successful Russian firms. This new type is particularly attractive for companies in the machine-building and chemical industries. Fenced field projects can be either wholly owned subsidiaries or joint ventures, but the main feature of such projects is the active use of the developed physical and business infrastructure of the “hosting” Russian company.

An explanatory model of the King of the Mountain is instead provided. Its focus is on the monopoly of political rent as a precondition for extraction of economic rent. It demonstrates an inverse correlation between the quality of institutions and the extraction of political and economic rent, and explains why an autocrat may not have an incentive to improve institutions that may make his/her monopoly vulnerable, and rather would prefer to preserve a low quality of institutions and bad enough governance. An analysis of a variety of external and domestic factors that may endanger this monopoly is provided. Finally, the autocrat's alternative strategic choices are analyzed.

We find that relative to students in Russia, Russian-medium students in the Baltics made significant gains in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test. In Latvia, these appear to be an unintended effect of somewhat ‘softened’ state language policies, the conditions surrounding minority rights, and the general context of maintaining social cohesion. In Estonia, the (later) relative gains of Russian students appear to an intended effect of locally grown educational (and language) policies and increased, more effective cooperation with Russian medium schools to further improve PISA performance in a relatively high scoring, PISA-focused country. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","achievement gains; educational reforms; language policy; natural experiment; State legitimation",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961391285

Unfortunately, this social pandemic was by and large inherited by these countries from the Soviet regime. A lot of representatives of that regime, who actually were the instigators of corrupt practices while governing a state, managed to keep their posts in power even after the regime change. In this way the representatives of the old regime facilitated further spread of corrupt practices in new governments. The research, conducted in cooperation with Professor Peter Rožič (USA), indicates an interesting phenomenon: lustration (in other words, the purge of government officials once affiliated with the Communist system) is indeed an effective mechanism to do away with corrupt legacy of a previous government. In the majority of post-socialist states (except for Albania and Bulgaria), where lustration was carried out in one form or another, we can observe a cleanup of the Soviet times instigators' corrupt practices in public authorities. Interestingly enough, nowadays, the corruption situation in these countries is considerably better than in those were lustration was not conducted. However, it is worth noting that lustration per se is not the panacea for corruption, but it does help to create a fertile ground and serves as a springboard for further anti-corruption measures and reforms. Yet what we see in Slovenia is, in fact, an obvious deviation from this pattern. Lustration was not carried out here. Nonetheless, the country is among the best anti-corruption performers and can be compared with Estonia, where lustration took place. Today, Estonia is ranked by Transparency International's CPI as a top performer among all other post-Soviet and post-socialist states. We, therefore, decided to look deeper into Slovenian anti-corruption efforts made by the new democratic government after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and to understand the reasons underlying its success in this field. Our research findings indicate that the first factor, which sets this situation apart, was filtering out the government authorities that could bring corrupt relationships or practices of the old Soviet regime, and replacing them with representatives of the nationally-oriented elites. This kind of purge, supposedly complemented by the factor of a small territorial and demographic size, created the advantageous conditions for corruption to be contained right from the start before it would become widespread. The second factor was following the GRECO recommendations to take institutional and legal anti-corruption measures during the process of accession to the European Union. Another defining characteristic of Slovenia is a relatively high quality of the political and good governance principles implementation inherent to the polyarchic democracy, which allows for corruption to be dealt with and kept at low levels through constant civil checks and balances over decisions and actions of authorities. © 2016 Russian Academy of Sciences.","Anti-corruption measures; Corruption; Polyarchic democracy; Purge of power; Reorganization; Slovenia",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035773237

An increase in childhood aggression is due to the fact that the Russian school being one of the key social institutions has been experiencing a severe crisis. Financial difficulties and endless educational reforms, the deterioration in teacher's performance since 1990s caused by a sharp decline in the prestige of the teaching profession have placed the Russian school in a dangerous situation where school violence is common. The article is based on the results of a large-scale questionnaire survey conducted among schoolchildren. To study the level and potential for violence in typical Russian schools, fourteen major socio-cultural factors were singled out. The most important ones include violent socialization in the family, the influence of the media, the level of children's insecurity in everyday life, regular use of illicit drugs and psychoactive substances, the perception of the «threshold of danger» in students' behavior. To prevent school violence, a system for resolving intra-school conflicts, a network of social contacts and relationships between all participants of school life should be developed; new educational and recreational policies to target children of different ages with regard to their biopsychosocial characteristics should be designed.","Aggression; Anomie; Family; Mass communication; School; Social control; Social environment; Socialization; Victim of violence; Violence",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020459648

By allowing the shape parameter of the power law to vary with the sales rank we managed to increase a traditionally used model's fit for most of the product categories.

We also validated and modified Garg and Telang's (2013) approach to inferring market shares using data on product price, sales rank and revenue rank.

An analysis of career and educational choices made by Russian nobles in the 1730s-1740s and recorded in the registers of the Heraldry and petitions for enrolment into the Noble Land Cadet Corps demonstrate that the members of the post-Petrine elite had very clear preferences regarding their service trajectories. As the choices made by noble families were shaped by the specific combinations of resources and threats each of them faced, there emerged deep cleavages within the elite in terms of the attitudes towards schooling. While wealthier nobles tended to join state schools, especially the Cadet Corps, the poorest nobility overwhelmingly ignored educational requirements and service registration rules imposed by the government, avoiding schools and preferring instead to enlist directly into regiments as privates. Despite numerous attempts, the government failed to force these poorer nobles to follow the new rules for entering schools and state service, codified in 1736-1737, and had to regularly issue collective pardons to the offenders. While wealth was one crucial factor shaping the nobles' service trajectories, their social connections and cultural endowments were no less important in channelling their educational and career choices and pushing them to embrace or reject the post-Petrine educational regime. As a result, the early modern ""Westernization"" of the Russian elite emerges as a dynamic social process driven by the choices made by the nobles themselves. © The Author 2015.

I formalize a general model that characterizes evolutionarily stable social activity. The proposed model replicates the theory of Newson et al. (2007) that fertility decline is caused by increasing role of oblique cultural transmission. Second, if social activity is a rational choice rather than a culturally inherited trait, and if cultural transmission acts on preferences rather than behaviors, which preferences survive the process of cultural evolution? I arrive at a very simple yet powerful result: under mild assumptions on model structure, only preferences which emphasize exclusively the concern for social prestige, i.e. extent to which one's cultural trait has been picked up by others, survive. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960449706

The old system of minimum wage setting was based on a single nationwide minimum wage which was differentiated across regions and occupations via a cumbersome framework of coefficients. The new system is a mixture of the government-set minimum wage at the federal level and collective agreements at the regional level. We show that the system of minimum wage setting has become more flexible. The reform succeeded in raising the real value of the minimum wage and increasing earnings of low-paid workers without causing significant negative effects in terms of employment. The reform did not lead to greater regional variation of minimum wages. Nevertheless, it introduced some new imbalances: an unintended consequence of the reform was the emergence of separate regional wage sub-minima for private and public sector workers in many regions. The major challenge in coming years is to strengthen the institutions of collective bargaining, introduce evidence-based evaluation and boost the capacities of government and non-government monitoring agencies. © University of New South Wales.","Collective bargaining; decentralisation; employer organisations; minimum wage; Russia; social partners; unions; wage distribution; wage policy; wage setting",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959440482

This study presents evidence against deriving dominant participle constructions from participles' attributive uses and argues that they should instead be analyzed as a syntactic nominalization in which the participle is the head that agrees with its subject in case. Our account relies on two separate components: (i) a clausal nominalization rule, introduced at the level of phrase structure, and closely resembling the structure of the English gerund; and (ii) a subject agreement rule, treated as a lexical property of Latin participles, and common to all their uses (not just the dominant use). Our synchronic account is supported by diachronic evidence, which suggests that the dominant participle construction developed in Latin through reanalysis of the absolute participle construction (shared by many ancient Indo-European languages). The change involved the introduction of a clausal nominalization rule, while the subject agreement rule was likely present from early on and not affected by the change. © The Philological Society 2015.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961050417

Empirical results have proven mixed, however. In this article, we argue that these mixed results are due to economic factors, which condition politicians' distributive strategies. In our model, we consider that politician and voters are involved in a repeated game, where past expectations condition future strategy. Current (core) supporters who receive few benefits and perceive themselves worse off than other, less loyal, groups are likely to be less loyal themselves tomorrow. In our model, politicians avoid this by providing their supporters consumption benefits directly, in the form of transfers, or indirectly, via strong economic growth. Where economic growth is good, politicians can distribute less to core supporters, who benefit from the rising economy. Where economic growth is weak, however, politicians make transfers to their core supporters to ensure future loyalty.

Fast AVX implementations produce exactly the same output sequences as the original algorithms. Usage of AVX vectorization allows to substantially improve performance of the generators. The new realizations are up to 2 times faster than the SSE realizations implemented in the previous version of the library (Barash and Shchur, 2013), and up to 40 times faster compared to the original algorithms written in ANSI C.

Computer: PC, laptop, workstation, or server with Intel or AMD processor. Operating system: Unix, Windows. RAM: 4 Mbytes Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEIT_v2_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 184(2013)2367 Classification: 4.13. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem: Any calculation requiring uniform pseudorandom number generator, in particular, Monte Carlo calculations. Any calculation requiring parallel streams of uniform pseudorandom numbers. Solution method: The library contains realization of the following modern and reliable generators: MT19937 [2], MRG32K3A [3], LFSR113 [4], GM19, GM31, GM61 [5, 6], and GM29, GM55, GQ58.1, GQ58.3, GQ58.4 [7, 8]. The library contains realizations written in ANSI C, realizations based on SSE command set and realizations based on AVX command set. The use of vectorization allows substantial improvement in performance of all the generators. The library also contains the ability to jump ahead inside the RNG sequence and to initialize independent random number streams with block splitting method for each of the RNGs. C and Fortran are supported. Reasons for new version: Modern CPUs better support vectorization compared to the CPUs available two years ago when the previous version of the library was prepared. In particular, Advanced Vector Instructions 2 (AVX2) are now supported by CPUs fabricated by Intel and AMD. AVX2 has been supported by Intel CPUs since the Haswell microarchitecture was released in June 2013, and has been supported by AMD CPUs since the Streamroller Family 15h microarchitecture was released in January 2014. An important new feature of this version is the ability to employ the AVX2 instruction set of a CPU in order to speed up the calculations. As a result, the new RNG realizations employing AVX2 are up to 2 times faster than the realizations implemented in the previous version of the library. Summary of revisions: 1. We added fast AVX realizations for the generators, which are up to 2 times faster than the SSE realizations implemented in the previous version of the library [1], and up to 40 times faster compared to the original algorithms written in ANSI C.2. The function call interface has been simplified compared to previous versions.3. We added automatic detection of whether the CPU supports SSE and/or AVX vectorization at the compilation stage and the functions which employ SSE and AVX vectorization only if the CPU supports them.4. We added support for simultaneous generation of two independent output sequences for the LFSR113 generator using the AVX vectorization.Restrictions: For AVX realizations of the generators, Intel or AMD CPU supporting AVX2 command set is required. For SSE realizations of the generators, Intel or AMD CPU supporting SSE2 command set is required. In order to use the SSE realization for the lfsr113 generator, CPU must support SSE4.1 command set. Additional comments: The function call interface has been simplified compared to the previous versions. For each of the generators, RNGAVXLIB supports the following functions, where rng should be replaced by name of a particular generator: void rng_init_(rng_state ∗ state); void rng_init_sequence_(rng_state ∗ state,unsigned long long SequenceNumber); void rng_skipahead_(rng_state ∗ state, unsigned long long N); unsigned int rng_generate_(rng_state ∗ state); float rng_generate_uniform_float_(rng_state ∗ state); unsigned int rng_ansi_generate_(rng_state ∗ state); float rng_ansi_generate_uniform_float_(rng_state ∗ state); unsigned int rng_sse_generate_(rng_state ∗ state); float rng_sse_generate_uniform_float_(rng_state ∗ state); unsigned int rng_avx_generate_(rng_state ∗ state); float rng_avx_generate_uniform_float_(rng_state ∗ state); void rng_print_state_(rng_state ∗ state); The function call interface for the rng_skipahead_ function, which jumps ahead N output values inside an RNG sequence, can be slightly different for some of the RNGs. For example, the function void mt19937_skipahead_(mt19937_state ∗ state, unsigned long long a, unsigned b); skips ahead N=a⋅2 b numbers, where N&gt;2 512 , and the function void gm55_skipahead_(gm55_state ∗ state, unsigned long long offset64, unsigned long long offset0); skips ahead N=2 64 ⋅offset64+offset0 numbers. The detailed function call interface can be found in the header files of the include directory. The examples of using the library can be found in the examples directory. Some of the generators have several versions of the rng_init_sequence_ routine, for example, rng_init_short_sequence_, rng_init_medium_sequence_, rng_init_long_sequence_ (see details in [1, 10]). Maximal number of sequences and maximal length of each sequence for pseudorandom streams are indicated in [1, 10]. The algorithms used to jump ahead in the RNG sequence and to initialize parallel streams of pseudorandom numbers are described in detail in [9, 10]. This version of the library automatically detects whether the CPU supports SSE and/or AVX vectorization at the compilation stage. During the compilation of the library, the −march=native compiler option is used, which allows the use of predefined macros such as __SSE2__ and __AVX2__ in the source code. This is supported by both GNU and Intel compilers. The functions rng_generate_ and rng_generate_uniform_float employ SSE and AVX vectorization only if the CPU supports them. Table 1: Speed of the realizations. CPU: Intel Xeon E5-2650v3 (2.3 GHz); Compiler: gcc; Optimization: -O3. This version of the library also supports simultaneous generation of two independent output sequences for the LFSR113 generator using the AVX vectorization: void lfsr113_avx_generate_two_(lfsr113 _state ∗ state, unsigned ∗ out1, unsigned ∗ out2); This is the fastest possible way to generate LFSR113 random numbers using the CPU which supports the AVX2 instruction set. The function lfsr113_skipahead_ jumps ahead only in the first LFSR output sequence. Jumping ahead in the second output sequence can be performed with the separate lfsr113_skipahead2_ routine. GNU Fortran does not have compiler directives for data alignment to assist vectorization, although Intel Fortran has directives for that, such as !dir$  attributes align:32. By default, GNU Fortran aligns all variables to 16-byte boundaries, which is sufficient to efficiently use SSE, but is not sufficient for AVX. We find that applying an additional SAVE command to the generator state in Fortran results, in particular, in alignment of the data to 32-byte boundaries. This allows one to employ AVX realizations from Fortran (see the examples directory). We have tested this on workstations with various CPUs and various versions of Linux. Development and optimization of the algorithms were supported by the Russian Science Foundation project No. 14-21-00158. Benchmark testing was partially supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research project No. 13-07-00570 and by the Supercomputing Center of Lomonosov Moscow State University [11]. Table 2: Speed of the realizations. CPU: Intel Core i7-4790K (4 GHz); Compiler: gcc; Optimization: -O3. Running time: Running time is of the order of 20 sec for generating 10 9 pseudorandom numbers with a PC based on Intel Core i7-940 CPU. Speed of the random number generation on CPUs widely used in modern servers and workstations is shown in Tables 1 and 2 respectively (see also [6, 7]). References: [1] L.Yu Barash, L.N.

Although little explored in urban studies, the city epitomizes a fascinating assemblage of processes that can illuminate the interplay of geopolitics, political choices, globalization discourses, histories, and urban contestations in shaping urban transformations. Tbilisi's strategic location in the South Caucasus, at the juncture of major historical empires and religions in Eurasia, has ensured its turbulent history and a polyphony of cultural influences. Following Georgia's independence in 1991, Tbilisi found itself as the pivot of Georgian nation-building. Transition to a market economy also exposed the city to economic hardship, ethnical homogenization, and the informalization of the urban environment. The economic recovery since the early 2000s has activated urban regeneration. Georgia's government has recently promoted flagship urban development projects in pursuit of making Tbilisi as a modern globalizing metropolis. This has brought contradictions, such as undermining the city's heritage, contributing to socio-spatial polarization, and deteriorating the city's public spaces. The elitist processes of decision-making and a lack of a consistent urban policy and planning regimes are argued to be among major impediments for a more sustainable development of this city. © 2015 The Authors.","Post-socialist city; Post-Soviet city; Tbilisi; Transition; Urban governance; Urban planning","capital city; economic regeneration; geopolitics; globalization; governance approach; market transition; metropolitan area; post-communism; sustainable development; urban development; urban planning; Georgia (republic); Tbilisi","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949579956

The author analyses doctrinal innovations and practical guidelines suggested by the Group and debates consequences of the recommended ""politicizing"" of the UN operations (assuring the leading role for the UN in any political peace process supported by UN peacekeepers, and avoiding operations where the UN role is limited to passive disengagement of conflict sides). Necessity for and limits of reconsidering traditional principles of peacekeeping, such as impartiality, consent of conflict parties, and use of force for self-defence are questioned. Trends in UN operations are compared with trends in operations related to conflicts in the Post-Soviet space (South Ossetia/Georgia, Abkhazia/Georgia, Tajikistan, Transnistria/Moldova, etc.). The author advocates timeliness for an extended interpretation of the ""defence of the mandate"" formula instead of the classical ""self-defence of the contingent"". It is suggested to practically erase the dividing line between operations of the ""peacekeeping"" type under the UN DPKO, and ""political missions"" under the UN Political Department. The arsenal of the UN instruments for conflict resolution must be widened from non-intru-sive observation missions, conflict prevention and mediation, through support of ceasefire agreements and implementation of peace accords, down to coercive peace enforcement, offensive elements, and UN Charter Chapter VH-based collective operations against aggressive regimes and states. Poorly defined functions and insufficiently clarified use offorce limits for the SC-mandated ""UN Intervention Brigade"" in Democratic Republic of Congo lead to unnecessary involvement of the UN into coercive actions. The experience of the UN ""infrastructural hubs"" establishing, like the one in Entebbe (Uganda) used for supplying eight African UN operations, is described. New technology for peacekeeping, like the use of unpiloted flying drones, opens new opportunities, but creates legal and practical problems. A distinction offunctions between ""blue helmets"" (specially trained multinational UN contingents) and ""green helmets "" (regular national armies used by states in foreign conflicts) is recommended, including avoidance of counter-terrorism tasks and strong coercive tasks for the UN peacekeepers. Parallel and interfaced ""partnerships"" between the limited UN operations and more forceful national/coalition operations in the same areas are suggested instead. © 2016 Russian Academy of Sciences.","Collective security treaty organization; Conflict resolution; Conflicts; Mediation; Peace operations; Peacekeeping; Preventive diplomacy; Regional organizations; United Nations; Use of force principles",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035811497

Comparable information on nonfatal health outcomes among these children and the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among older children and adolescents is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To determine levels and trends in the fatal and nonfatal burden of diseases and injuries among younger children (aged < 5 years), older children (aged 5-9 years), and adolescents (aged 10-19 years) between 1990 and 2013 in 188 countries from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Data from vital registration, verbal autopsy studies, maternal and child death surveillance, and other sources covering 14 244 site-years (ie, years of cause of death data by geography) from 1980 through 2013 were used to estimate cause-specific mortality. Data from 35 620 epidemiological sources were used to estimate the prevalence of the diseases and sequelae in the GBD 2013 study. Cause-specific mortality for most causes was estimated using the Cause of Death Ensemble Model strategy. For some infectious diseases (eg, HIVinfection/AIDS, measles, hepatitis B) where the disease process is complex or the cause of death data were insufficient or unavailable, we used natural history models. For most nonfatal health outcomes, DisMod-MR2.0, a Bayesian metaregression tool, was used to meta-analyze the epidemiological data to generate prevalence estimates. FINDINGS: Of the 7.7 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 7.4-8.1) million deaths among children and adolescents globally in 2013,6.28 million occurred amongyounger children, 0.48 million among older children, and 0.97 million among adolescents. In 2013, the leading causes of death were lower respiratory tract infections amongyounger children (905 059 deaths; 95% UI, 810 304-998125), diarrheal diseases among older children (38 325 deaths; 95% UI, 30 365-47 678), and road injuries among adolescents (115186 deaths; 95% UI, 105185-124 870). Iron deficiency anemia was the leading cause of years lived with disability among children and adolescents, affecting 619 (95% UI, 618-621) million in 2013. Large between-country variations exist in mortality from leading causes among children and adolescents. Countries with rapid declines in all-cause mortality between 1990 and 2013 also experienced large declines in most leading causes of death, whereas countries with the slowest declines had stagnant or increasing trends in the leading causes of death. In 2013, Nigeria had a 12% global share of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections and a 38% global share of deaths from malaria. India had 33% of the world's deaths from neonatal encephalopathy. Half of the world's diarrheal deaths among children and adolescents occurred injust 5 countries: India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Ethiopia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Understanding the levels and trends of the leading causes of death and disability among children and adolescents is critical to guide investment and inform policies. Monitoring these trends over time is also key to understanding where interventions are having an impact. Proven interventions exist to prevent or treat the leading causes of unnecessary death and disability among children and adolescents. The findings presented here show that these are underused and give guidance to policy makers in countries where more attention is needed. Copyright 2016 American Medical Association.

We compute the quantum periods of all 3-dimensional Fano manifolds. In particular we show that 3-dimensional Fano manifolds with very ample anticanonical bundle have mirrors given by a collection of Laurent polynomials called Minkowski polynomials. This was conjectured in joint work with Golyshev. It suggests a new approach to the classification of Fano manifolds: by proving an appropriate mirror theorem and then classifying Fano mirrors. our methods are likely to be of independent interest. We rework the Mori-Mukai classification of 3-dimensional Fano manifolds, showing that each of them can be expressed as the zero locus of a section of a homogeneous vector bundle over a GIT quotient V//G, where G is a product of groups of the form GL n (ℂ) and V is a representation of G. When G = GL 1 (ℂ) r , this expresses the Fano 3-fold as a toric complete intersection; in the remaining cases, it expresses the Fano 3 -fold as a tautological subvariety of a Grassmannian, partial flag manifold, or projective bundle thereon. We then compute the quantum periods using the quantum Lefschetz hyperplane theorem of Coates and Givental and the abelian/non-abelian correspondence of Bertram, Ciocan-Fontanine, Kim and Sabbah. © 2016, Mathematical Sciences Publishers.

Mining of such data collections is essential to support many real-world applications ranging from healthcare to marketing. In this work, we focus on the analysis of complex sequential data by means of interesting sequential patterns. We approach the problem using the elegant mathematical framework of formal concept analysis and its extension based on pattern structures. Pattern structures are used for mining complex data (such as sequences or graphs) and are based on a subsumption operation, which in our case is defined with respect to the partial order on sequences. We show how pattern structures along with projections (i.e. a data reduction of sequential structures) are able to enumerate more meaningful patterns and increase the computing efficiency of the approach. Finally, we show the applicability of the presented method for discovering and analysing interesting patient patterns from a French healthcare data-set on cancer. The quantitative and qualitative results (with annotations and analysis from a physician) are reported in this use-case which is the main motivation for this work. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Data mining; Formal concept analysis; Pattern structures; Projections; Sequences; Sequential data","Data mining; Health care; Information analysis; Textile printing; Computing efficiency; Mathematical frameworks; Pattern structure; projections; sequences; Sequential data; Sequential patterns; Sequential structure; Formal concept analysis","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944332513

These discretizations involve nonstandard approximations for ∇p(ρ), div(ρu), and ρ. As a result, a discrete total mass conservation law and a discrete energy inequality guaranteeing that the total energy does not grow with time can be derived.

Instead, the Russian financial market institutions were rendered into a vehicle for inter-bank lending under control of the Central Bank of Russia.

That is why the process of demand forecasting under such circumstances is called unconstraining. The goal of every unconstraining approach is to get empirical or theoretical estimation of true demand. The application of the maximum likelihood method to unconstraining problems in Revenue Management is advocated in the article based on the construction of the distribution function for the censored demand depending on availability of the censoring information. Numerical results are presented on comparative analysis of existing unconstraining methods and the method used in the article. It is demonstrated that maximum likelihood method proves to be more efficient in case of high percentage of censoring. Another important advantage of the method connected to the fact that it enables one to process the situation of censoring information incompleteness when some elements of the observed sample data are known to be censored or not and for the others this information is not available.

More importantly, it develops a typology of higher education institutions that is relevant for the Russian context. The Ward method is used to cluster universities on the basis of university distinctions in terms of the availability of resources, education, and research and development. This typology of universities is verified by assessing their efficiency score gained from modified Data Envelopment Analysis, incorporating universities' heterogeneity. Finally, the paper gives a decision tree for classifying universities bearing in mind their diversity.

Focusing on the number of subcategorization options, we investigated verb argument structure effects in a large sample of narratives from AphasiaBank, by speakers with aphasia, as well as control speakers without brain damage. Verb argument structure complexity did not negatively affect verb selection in any type of aphasia.

In this paper we discuss two physically meaningful regularization procedures, one corresponding to vanishing viscosity and another to weak noise limit. We show that for any convex Hamiltonian, a viscous regularization allows us to construct a nonsmooth flow that extends particle trajectories and determines dynamics inside the shock manifolds. This flow consists of integral curves of a particular “effective” velocity field, which is uniquely defined everywhere in the flow domain and is discontinuous on shock manifolds.

Nowadays, there is a lot of interest in assessing functional interactions between its key regions, but in the majority of studies only association of Blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activation patterns is measured, so it is impossible to identify causal influences. There are some studies of causal interactions (i.e., effective connectivity), however often with inconsistent results. The aim of the current work is to find a stable pattern of connectivity between four DMN key regions: the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), left and right intraparietal cortex (LIPC and RIPC). For this purpose functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 30 healthy subjects (1000 time points from each one) was acquired and spectral dynamic causal modeling (DCM) on a resting-state fMRI data was performed. The endogenous brain fluctuations were explicitly modeled by Discrete Cosine Set at the low frequency band of 0.0078–0.1 Hz. The best model at the group level is the one where connections from both bilateral IPC to mPFC and PCC are significant and symmetrical in strength (p < 0.05). Connections between mPFC and PCC are bidirectional, significant in the group and weaker than connections originating from bilateral IPC. In general, all connections from LIPC/RIPC to other DMN regions are much stronger. One can assume that these regions have a driving role within the DMN. Our results replicate some data from earlier works on effective connectivity within the DMN as well as provide new insights on internal DMN relationships and brain’s functioning at resting state. © 2016 Sharaev, Zavyalova, Ushakov, Kartashov and Velichkovsky.","Default mode network (DMN); Dynamic causal modeling (DCM); Effective connectivity; Resting-state fMRI; Resting-state networks","causal modeling; clinical article; default mode network; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; medial prefrontal cortex; posterior cingulate; rest","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957811504

The duality establishes an explicit relationship between the classical N-body trigonometric Ruijsenaars-Schneider model and the inhomogeneous twisted XXZ spin chain on N sites. Similarly to the rational version, the spin chain data fixes a certain Lagrangian submanifold in the phase space of the classical integrable system. The inhomogeneity parameters are equal to the coordinates of particles while the velocities of classical particles are proportional to the eigenvalues of the spin chain Hamiltonians (residues of the properly normalized transfer matrix). In the rational version of the duality, the action variables of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model are equal to the twist parameters with some multiplicities defined by quantum (occupation) numbers. In contrast to the rational version, in the trigonometric case there is a splitting of the spectrum of action variables (eigenvalues of the classical Lax matrix). The limit corresponding to the classical Calogero-Sutherland system and quantum trigonometric Gaudin model is also described as well as the XX limit to free fermions. © 2015 The Authors.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950972215

Here, we investigated whether functional connectivity at rest between these brain regions is associated with individual and sex-related differences in thermal pain and relief responsiveness. Twenty healthy volunteers (ten females) were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging in resting conditions. Half an hour after scanning, we administered thermal pain on the back of their right hand and collected pain and relief ratings in two separate runs of twelve stimuli each. Across the whole group, mean pain ratings were associated with decreased connectivity at rest between brain regions belonging to the default mode and the visual resting-state network. In men, pain measures correlated with increased connectivity within the visual resting-state network. In women, in contrast, decreased connectivity between this network and parietal and prefrontal brain regions implicated in affective cognitive control were associated with both pain and relief ratings. Our findings indicate that the well documented individual variability and sex differences in pain sensitivity may be explained, at least in part, by network dynamics at rest in these brain regions. Functional connectivity at rest predicts individual and sex-related differences in pain ratings collected outside the scanner. Across the whole group, pain ratings are associated with decreased connectivity between brain regions belonging to the default mode and the visual resting-state network.

This paper provides an overview of injury estimates from the 2013 update of GBD, with detailed information on incidence, mortality, DALYs and rates of change from 1990 to 2013 for 26 causes of injury, globally, by region and by country. Methods Injury mortality was estimated using the extensive GBD mortality database, corrections for illdefined cause of death and the cause of death ensemble modelling tool. Morbidity estimation was based on inpatient and outpatient data sets, 26 cause-of-injury and 47 nature-of-injury categories, and seven follow-up studies with patient-reported long-term outcome measures. Results In 2013, 973 million (uncertainty interval (UI) 942 to 993) people sustained injuries that warranted some type of healthcare and 4.8 million (UI 4.5 to 5.1) people died from injuries. Between 1990 and 2013 the global age-standardised injury DALY rate decreased by 31% (UI 26% to 35%). The rate of decline in DALY rates was significant for 22 cause-of-injury categories, including all the major injuries. Conclusions Injuries continue to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the developed and developing world. The decline in rates for almost all injuries is so prominent that it warrants a general statement that the world is becoming a safer place to live in. However, the patterns vary widely by cause, age, sex, region and time and there are still large improvements that need to be made. © 2016 BMJ Publishing Group.

However, convincing the public that climate change is real faces powerful ideological obstacles, and climate change is slipping in public importance in many countries. Here we investigate a different approach, identifying whether potential co-benefits of addressing climate change could motivate pro-environmental behaviour around the world for both those convinced and unconvinced that climate change is real. We describe an integrated framework for assessing beliefs about co-benefits, distinguishing social conditions (for example, economic development, reduced pollution or disease) and community character (for example, benevolence, competence). Data from all inhabited continents (24 countries; 6,196 participants) showed that two co-benefit types, Development (economic and scientific advancement) and Benevolence (a more moral and caring community), motivated public, private and financial actions to address climate change to a similar degree as believing climate change is important. Critically, relationships were similar for both convinced and unconvinced participants, showing that co-benefits can motivate action across ideological divides. These relationships were also independent of perceived climate change importance, and could not be explained by political ideology, age, or gender.

However, because of globalization we see that today the new world order is being established on some other and more fair principles because the United States and the West continue to gradually weaken. With regard to the decline of u.s. leadership and the rise of the developing countries we expect that no country can substitute for the United States as the hegemonic power. Thus, the World System will continue its development in the future without an absolute leader. So, in the next decades the global political landscape will undergo dramatic changes. We are at the outset of a very complex, contradictory, and long process of creating a new world order. The directions, forms, and results of the processes of its transformations to a great extent depend on the changing balance of world forces and on different geopolitical factors and combinations. Philosophy faces many problems with respect to the creation of a new world order. Without doubt philosophers can do much to make better and more humane the world order that is being created. © 2016 by Koninklijke Brill nv, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Findings – The analysis shows that wage satisfaction is the strongest negative predictor of Russian employees’ intentions to leave compared to core job-related and interpersonal relations satisfaction. For non-blat employees, the relationships with intentions to leave are negative and significant for all three types of satisfactions, whereas for employees with blat only the relationship between core job-related satisfaction and intentions to leave is significant. Originality/value – The present study, first, reveals that wage satisfaction is the most important but not the only way to retain blue-collar employees in Russia and, second, points toward the complex nature of blat’s influence on employees’ organizational behavior in contemporary Russian organizations.

This analysis focuses on narratives of student attrition and its causes and reveals the generally accusatory nature of the professor discourse. All the narratives can be integrated and described in terms of the metaphor of the trial. In its most obvious form, the accusation that students are to blame for attrition is developed as a type of discourse that can be called prosecutorial, but it can also be developed in speeches resembling those made by defense attorneys and judges. These three types of discourse build figurative barriers between the university and professors, on the one hand, and students, on the other hand. These barriers encourage professors to feel uninvolved in student attrition. Not one of the three discourse types articulates the university's mission or problematizes the principles and goals of its activities. We suggest that the “bad student” discourse reflects some real problems associated with the massification of education and inevitable changes to the student body. An analysis of the professor discourse allows us to hypothesize that their response to these changes is limited to stating the problems and disassociating themselves from them. The construction of figurative barriers may result in professors' self-distancing not only from students, but also from the changes affecting the education system. Such self-distancing complicates the process of adapting to these changes and makes it difficult to control. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989873955

The theme of senseformation, a recurring thread throughout Husserl’s entire body of work, serves as a discussion starting point. A special emphasis is put on one of Husserl’s posthumously published texts from 1933, in which he distinguishes between the open process of sense-formation [Sinnbildung] and the closed sense-structures [Sinngebilde]. The ""phenomenon"" to which phenomenological philosophy refers here is not a ""pre-given thing"" yet, but rather the horizon in which its sense is shaped. This fundamental intuition is crucially important for the project of ""nonstandard"" phenomenology, which Richir is developing in the context of Francophone philosophy. Drawing equally from Maurice Merleau-Ponty’ phenomenology of language, Richir refers to ""the sense that creates itself."" In this way, he is continuing to develop one of the key intuitions of phenomenological philosophy, which Husserl establishes by distinguishing between the living process of sense-formation and the ""fixed [static]"" sense-structures. Based on this fundamental distinction, phenomenological philosophy is described as one of the tools of modern humanities rather than a highly specialized philosophical doctrine closed into itself. The author demonstrates that the conceptual pair of Sinnbildung/Sinngebilde may be used for analyzing both philosophical works and literary texts. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Husserl; Intermediate perception; Pregiveness; Primal instituting; Richir; Semantic augmentation of perception; Semantic sediment; Senf-formation; Sense-fixation; Sensestructure",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978755668

Religious and economic spheres are mediated by labour which takes different forms, creating distinct, but related disciplinary labour spaces.

We complement the discussion by bringing the model's constructive mechanisms or self-implementing technologies in play. By this, we mean the elements of the economic model that are aimed at ‘implementing’ it by envisaging the ways to change the reality in order to bring it more in line with the model. We are thus concerned mainly not with the ways to change the model to ‘fit’ the reality, but rather with the model's own armature that is supposed to transform the world along theoretical lines. The case we study is Arrow–Debreu–McKenzie general equilibrium model. In particular, we show the following: gradient methods and stability could be regarded as constructive mechanisms of general equilibrium modeling in the context of market socialism debates; the obsession of general equilibrium theorists with these concepts can be partly explained by the fact that they hoped not to be faithful to reality, but rather to adjust it to fit the theoretical model; mechanism design theory initiated by the stability theorist Leonid Hurwicz could be seen as a successor of this position. We conclude by showing the relevance of this analysis for epistemic culture of much of contemporary economics and hence, claim that it is an important complement to the traditional philosophy of economic modeling. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","general equilibrium; implementation; mechanism design; models; stability of equilibrium",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961201964

However, the ultimate argument here is that, contrary to Priest's interpretation, Hegel's philosophy can be convincingly read as supporting the idea that the mind's ability to go beyond any particular limit of thought can actually be said to involve an adherence to a normative demand to locate and dispel the contradictions that emerge through the very setting of determinative limits.

The economy is modelled by use of the, so-called, fK endogenous growth model based on microfoundations describing the labour institutions. Despite a rather small formal difference, the model differs much in its properties from traditional growth models. The fK model generalises the well-known AK model but is free of the known shortcomings of the latter. Our analytical results as well as computer simulations show that, despite the presence of temporary acceleration opportunities, the unstable windfalls prohibit long-run sustainable growth. The windfall can be followed by a restructuring leading to a long-run economic decline after ceasing the capital inflow. The effect of the capital inflow depends on the relation between the expected inflow growth rate and the economic growth rate of the benchmark model (without inflow), as well as on the time preferences in the economy. If the capital inflow is expected to grow faster than the proper growth rate of the economy, this can lead to a decline in wages. © 2016 The Author(s).","Economic development; Economic dynamics; Economic growth; Foreign aid; Labour institutions; Oil windfall; Production function","capital flow; economic development; economic growth; international aid; labor market; vulnerability; wage","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047920739

The study examined the forging force, the uniformity of deformation of the vessel’s walls, the filling of the dies, and the probability of crimping. Consideration was given to the possibility of using the phenomenon of superplasticity to forge the given product. The superplastic flow regime is maintained only during the final stage of the forging operation (the last 20% of the stroke of the die) in order to shorten operation as a whole. This is done by setting the die speed at a value which ensures that the material is deformed within a prescribed rate range and that the limits specified for the maximum forces are observed. Several alternatives were examined for making the vessel, these variants differing in the form of the semifinished product and the configuration of the dies. With constraints on the maximum loads and forging time, the technology that was chosen makes it possible to significantly increase the coefficient that characterizes the utilization of titanium in the production process. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Forging; Mathematical modeling; Optimization of manufacturing; Spherical tank; Titanium","Deformation; Dies; Forging; Mathematical models; Pressure vessels; Titanium; Computer modeling; Forging force; Maximum forces; Maximum load; Production process; Semi-finished products; Spherical tank; Superplastic flow; Finite element method","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046702111

This component is presented as a multipurpose mechanism which functions both in the internal subsystem of criminality (selfdetermination, or causality) and the external one (determination, or conditionality). The author focuses on these two functions of criminal culture. Thus, one of them supports the existence of crime as a social and legal phenomenon, or self-determination, in which the energy of self-assertion and psychological protection is used. Self-assertion initiates the expansion effect that determines the expansion function of criminal culture. The function’s activity is closely connected with external conditions of criminality. This interconnection acts as a basis for the other function aimed at optimizing the external connections of criminality. The effect is especially evident in penitentiary conditions where criminal culture is transformed into prison subculture characterized by the highest degree of criminality’s reproduction. Criminal culture is viewed as a highly complex systemic factor of crime and an object of the corresponding system of law enforcement counteraction. This means that effective counteraction to criminal culture is only possible on the basis of a systemic approach. Moreover, the anti-criminal potential of the counteraction system should exceed the criminal potential with which criminality is charged. The author analyses the influence of criminal culture that is hardly noticeable at first glance but has a deeply destructive effect on the moral and legal conscience of people and, especially, on the formation of a criminal personality. The paper examines the most important elements of criminal culture in the mechanism of personality criminalization. The author uses the theoretical research of a well known Russian criminologist Professor O.V. Starkov on the mechanism linking pre-criminal and criminal behavior. The conclusions of the theoretical analysis of this issue are supported by an empirical basis, mainly represented by the materials of applied criminological research carried out by the author. The author presents measures of counteracting criminal culture as an extension of the ideas on its neutralization found in criminological publications.

Certain topographical features, varied hydrological conditions in rivers, and diverse weather conditions required a flexible system of waterways as a means of communication. In a pre-industrial landscape, the transport network was a compromise between the needs of the individual and the problems imposed by natural factors. The effectiveness of transportation systems depended on organisational and economic factors: governmental structures and communities could obviously provide a greater level of organisation than individuals. One of such communities was the monastery: the Spaso-Prilutsky monastery was a considerable force in the organisation of trade in Northern Russia.

The main sources were documents from the Razryad (service lists) and Pomestny Prikaz (land chancellery): local Novgorod court records also furnished further information. The history of the Novgorod Tartars began in the 1550s, when groups from Astrakhan and Kazan were settled in the eastern part of Novgorod region (Sugletsa and Udomlya districts). As they served the tsar, they received landed estates in Novgorod that were populated with Orthodox peasants. Between 1550 and 1611, different Muslim groups were transferred to Novgorod from Azov, the Crimea, and Bukhara; these groups maintained special identities for a long time. The conversion of Muslims to Orthodoxy is focused upon in this article: the process was slow, but the predominance of Orthodoxy in the region gradually induced local Tartar groups to accept baptism. In 1605, there were 197 newly-baptised Tartars and 48 Muslims. After the Time of Troubles, the differences between the various groups of Tartars disappeared. Most of the Tartars lost their landed estates and started to serve for food and salary; nonetheless, this special group of Novgorodian servicemen continued to exist until the Great Northern War.","16th-17th centuries Russian history; Conversion; Newly-Baptized; Novgorod Land; Prosopography; Settling; Tartars",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021930562

To trace the dynamics of youth mortality rates in Russia in 1959-2014, to compare it with that in European counties, and, based on the analysis of differences in the causes of death, to understand due to what factors the gap has grown over the past 50 years. For this, mortality data were analyzed. This established that the main differences in Russian youth mortality rates are seen in the level of the mortality classes «external causes of death» and «circulatory diseases». An incomplete epidemiological transition and a severe increase in mortality from these major causes of death in Russia in the 1990s further increased the gap in death rates with other European countries. The downward trend in Russia's mortality in the key sections of the class «external causes of death», such as «transport accidents» and «intentional self-harms», has begun to emerge recently, since the mid-2000s. This trend was observed in European countries even at the end of the 20th century. High mortality in young people is determined by both objective (healthcare quality and availability) and subjective (self-estimated health, care of health, attitude towards medicine, risk-taking behavior, and value of their own and other people's lives) factors. The subjective factors are associated with vital behavior-human actions aimed at maintaining physical, somatic, and mental health. Unlike other causes of death, the class «external causes of death» directly reflects young people's tendencies toward risky behavior, as well as unfavorable environmental conditions. The existing difference in the mortality rates of Russian and European youth is therefore insurmountable without changing the vital behavior of Russia' young people.","Causes of death; Convergence-divergence of mortality; Epidemiological transition; Vital behavior; Youth mortality",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021845425

Fixed-term contracts can contribute to innovation, because they enhance the flexibility of labor relations and create savings in the use of workers. However, fixed-term contracts can reduce the likelihood of innovation because they reduce investment in human capital, leading to a reduction in labor productivity. Which trends dominate in labour relations is the subject of this study. For the study, we was used the data about enterprises from the annual Russian Enterprises Survey in 2014.

The results showed that fixed-term contracts have a positive effect on the innovation activity of enterprises only when they are used in a limited quantity. With an increase in the percentage of workers in enterprises with fixedterm contracts, the likelihood of innovation activity of enterprises declines.","Fixed-term contracts; Human capital and innovation; Innovative activity of enterprises; Investment; Non-standard employment; Russia; Types of innovation",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021840376

In this regard, there is growing demand for innovative management tools combining solutions from different fields. The 'smart city' concept is one of the most sought after. This article analyses the advantages of this concept, the necessary conditions, as well as the obstacles for implementing it. We consider the challenges related to becoming a 'smart city', the different ways a smart city comes into being, evaluate the future for smart city solutions, as well as assess the current willingness of administrations of Russian cities to adopt this model. From our analysis, we conclude that 'smart city' strategies continue in many cases to rely on a narrow, 'technological' approach. Such an approach presupposes that the availability alone of smart infrastructure can solve many urban problems and improve the quality of urban life. However, in contrast to the extended, comprehensive approach, it does not address many socioeconomic factors and the real needs of the population. Consequently, certain targets remain largely unfulfilled. The implementation of an integrated approach implies a number of conditions, such as the ability to integrate management decisions taken at various levels and predict how changes in one system affect other systems; a focus on interdisciplinary collaboration; and an ability to deal with resistance to changes. A survey conducted by the HSE's Research Institute for Regional and Urban Planning in 2015 aimed to evaluate the future prospects for establishing the concept of 'smart city' in Russian cities. The survey results show that city managers in Russia in general positively perceive the 'smart city' approach as a basis for urban development strategies. Yet, the possibilities for implementing it are mostly seen as medium or long-term options.","Complex systems management; Comprehensive approach; Innovation; Smart city; Technological approach; Urban policy",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021776242

Thus, the idea that acquiring knowledge was an unproblematic transfer of what is already available and can be unilaterally transferred and assimilated was rejected [Lave, Wenger, 1991]. The aim of this paper is to study the opportunities persented by electronic network platforms for using the collective nature of knowledge in the interests of further developing knowledge and innovation through online communication of professionals. Based on a literature review on the development of knowledge, the paper compares the basic principles of knowledge application in formulating new decisions during real joint activity and during online communication within specialized platforms for 'knowledge exchange'. The author argues that electronic networking platforms contribute to the fragmentation of knowledge representation of participants, eluding a common sense and purpose. Thus, such platforms blur the boundary between knowledge and information. The article indicates that the desire to increase the effectiveness of collective creativity via online communication risks not developing competencies, discretion, and exploration of others' experiences. Instead, this desire leads to strengthening external control and separation of functions into primary routine operations when an individual participant is valued not for his/ her knowledge and previous experience, but for his/ her communicative capabilities. The produced effect is akin to the industrial revolution of the machine era; when this effect is widespread, there are risks that knowledge workers will be turned into easily replaceable, piecemeal workers. To avoid this, electronic platforms should either learn to recreate the conditions of offline micro-environments of innovation, or not claim to fulfil the role of knowledge production.","Communication; Communities Of Practice; Connection; Electronic Platforms; Innovation; Joint Activity; Knowledge; Social Interaction; Working Team",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021753044

These are, however, hard to conceptualize and measure. First, we need to consider the nature of research activity itself and, second, we need to evaluate a number of factors that influence such activities at the national, institutional and individual levels. One of the key issues is motivation of academic personnel, who are considered the main producers of new knowledge. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse the employment characteristics of researchers, and develop adequate mechanisms to facilitate their scientific productivity. This paper aims to examine determinants of publication activity among doctorate holders employed in the academic sector in Russia. Data for the analysis was derived from a survey on the labour market for highly qualified R&D personnel conducted in 2010 by the HSE, within the framework of the OECD/UNESCO Institute for Statistics/Eurostat international project on Careers of Doctorate Holders (CDH). With the use of regression analysis, we assess the effects of scientific capital, international cooperation, employment, and socio-demographic characteristics of researchers on their productivity, which is measured through their total publication output as well as through the number of papers in peer-reviewed academic journals. The differences between factors were assessed for two generations of researchers-those under 40 years old, and above. It was shown that the quality of scientific capital, measured through diversity of research experience, has a stronger impact on research productivity, rather than the age or other socio-demographic characteristics of doctorate holders. It was also demonstrated that direct economic stimuli and actual research productivity of researchers are weakly correlated. Consequently, we identified that a potentially winning strategy for universities and research institutions that want to improve their performance indicators would be to provide younger scholars with wider opportunities for professional growth, including intense global cooperation in the professional community.","Bibliometric indicators; Human capital; Performance-based payment; Russian scholars; Scientific publications; The productivity of science",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021630581

One major trend is the proliferation and diversification of actors, forums and their arrangements to address global governance challenges, which has led to fragmentation in global governance. However, such contested multilateralism has a positive dimension, as the emergence of informal multilateral institutions claiming a major role in defining the global governance agenda creates alternatives for providing common goods. New arrangements acquire their own actorness and place in the system of global governance. In certain policy areas, there is a clear trend for the new summit institutions' leadership. The most visible recent cases include the Group of 20 (G20), the BRICS group of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, with APEC gaining importance regionally and globally. These new informal groupings work on their own agenda. They also engage with established international organizations to steer global governance processes. Taken together, the transformative trends in international relations, the emergence of new actors, tensions between exclusive and inclusive clubs, and demands for the legitimacy and effectiveness of the international institutions define the relevance of the study, systematization and comparative analysis of the effectiveness of this model of cooperation among international institutions. This article builds an analytical framework by undertaking three tasks. It first reviews the key concepts. Second, it argues for a rational choice institutionalist approach. Third, it puts forward a hypothesis for research: to compensate for their inefficiencies, summit institutions engage with other international organizations in a mode they regard most efficient for attainment of their goals. The modes of those institutions' engagement with other international organizations as reflected in the leaders' discourse should thus indicate the role of those institutions in the global governance architecture, which is imputed at their launch and subsequent evolution. The hypothesis further suggests that the ""governing in alliance"" mode enhances the effectiveness of the summit institutions; however, those institutions' use is not mutually exclusive. The modes of engagement with international institutions coexist in the engagement of informal summit institutions with other international organizations. The choice is defined by the policy area and type of organizations. The article concludes with a case study of BRICS engagement with international institutions. The results confirm that the choice of engagement model reflects the forum's role and place in the global governance architecture. To maximize benefits from cooperation, the BRICS engages with relevant international organizations on agenda priorities at different institutional levels. Two types of engagement are typical for the BRICS: catalytic engagement (exerting an influence for changes in international organizations through endorsement or stimulus, or compelling them to reform) and parallel treatment (creation of the institution's own mechanisms). By establishing new institutions, the BRICS consistently strengthens its cooperation with other international institutions.

On one level, the SREB is a transport and logistics initiative to deliver Chinese goods to Europe. However, more than this, the SREB is a comprehensive project to develop Central Asian countries and to respond to economic and political processes within China and the larger Asia-Pacific region. Specifically, the SREB is intended to meet challenges - increasing income gaps, the growing presence of the United States in Asia and changing labour patterns - that are transforming the region's social and economic landscape. In this context, the SREB is an expression of China's desire to create strong regional value chains, to outsource labour-intensive and environmentally harmful production, to foster the development of northwestern China, to create conditions for political stability in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, and to guarantee that Chinese construction firms are operating at full capacity. To the extent that the SREB is about the transport of goods, this is driven by the need to diversify export risks in the face of deteriorating military and political conditions in the sea rather than by perceived commercial benefits. The Joint Statement on Cooperation on the Construction of Joint Eurasian Economic Union and the Silk Road Projects signed on 8 May 2015 represents a milestone in China-Russia relations and potentially lays to rest concerns about competition between these two projects. Indeed, the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) and the SREB are complementary projects with the former providing an institutional basis for cooperation and the latter providing the necessary investment resources for joint projects. If successful, the coordination of the EEU and the SREB will make it possible to overcome potential contradictions in Central Asia - the source of the most serious tensions between Russia and China. Participation in the SREB may come with certain benefits for Russia. First, the integration of Russia's transportation system into the logistics network of the Eurasian region will give Russia's transit and associated logistical services access to growing regional markets. Second, the SREB creates opportunities to strengthen industrial cooperation between neighbouring countries and to develop new economic clusters. Third, the integration of the EEU and the SREB may support the more ambitious project of cooperation in the greater Eurasia area and transform the region into a new centre of economic development on the global level.","Eurasian Economic Union; Russia-China relations; Silk Road Economic Belt",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021351987

Engaging with two major theoretical perspectives on this regional project, we aim to establish to what extent it is economic regionalism (interpreted also as an isolationist strategy), vis-à-vis Russia-led geopolitical motives, that drives the construction and potential expansion of the Eurasian Union. The political-economy debate of Eurasia goes beyond a common tariff area and a common market within the territory of the former USSR. Increasingly, it involves the establishment of a common monetary area. It appears that a new Silk Road is being laid with foundations for a new Eurasia - one of the global economic and political players of this century. In our analysis, the economic reasons pursued by Russia in the Eurasian initiative are in fact inseparable from the economic problems of geopolitical significance. We argue that overarching objective of Russian policy is to establish a regional economic fusion, with significant economic sovereignty and strong political influence; that is, the new centre of power in the global economy of the 21st century. Correspondingly, our analysis also suggests that while Russian integration policy in Eurasia has not been formulated in an anti-American way, if successful, the likely consequence will be that a significant segment of the global market will be withdrawn from under the economic dominance and political influence of Western-led economic blocks.","Eurasian Union; Global governance",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021333353

When is a resolution legitimate and when does it extend beyond the UNSC's mandate? Can a resolution be mandatory as well as supplementary, or can it change the norms of international law, which operate outside the UN. The vast majority of resolutions are intended to solve a specific situation that threatens international peace and security. Russian and foreign scholars refer to the same documents and decisions of international judicial bodies, but interpret them differently. In this article the author analyzes arguments about the existence of the UNSC's legislative powers, using a comparative analysis formulated for this purpose. Obligations arising from article 25 of the Charter apply only to UNSC decisions adopted for implementing or controlling existing norms of international law and not newly formulated norms. Article 103 is intended for obligations under the UN Charter, and not for acts made pursuant to basic documents. The Charter does not allow the UNSC to make decisions that require acts and at the same time add or modify international law. The UNSC can create subsidiary bodies that extend the scope of discussions related to threats to peace and security, but cannot change the limits of the use of enforcement measures under articles 41 and 42. The Counter-Terrorism Committee, created by Resolution 1373 (2001), supports UN members' sovereign efforts to prevent terrorism and the 1540 Committee helps members prevent the trafficking of nuclear material and the use of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. There is no evidence of any customary rule of international law based on UNSC decisions. The author refutes the claim that Resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1540 (2004) support the universal agreement associated with the Counter-Terrorism Committee or the 1540 Committee. The only undisputed basis for the UNSC making normative decisions is article 43, which grants the power to make international treaties. However, in practice the UNSC does not use this provision. The author concludes that the best way to clarify the UNSC's true legal position, limits and the basis of its activities under Chapter VII to determine the principles and criteria that guide its authority, which allow it to grant permission for the use of force, is to hold a special session of the UN General Assembly.","1540 Committee; Acts ultra vires; Counter-Terrorism Committee; Decision making; Legislative powers; Peace and security; The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda; The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia; United Nations; United Nations Charter; United Nations General Assembly; United Nations Security Council; Weapons of mass destruction",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021324155

While such distinction can be productive for analyzing development assistance at a global level, it might bring less value when considering development aid milieu at a local level. In this article the author considers the case of Kyrgyzstan and its main aid donors based on select criteria set out by the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation. It draws on an analysis of databases, official documents, open sources including media and the country's National Sustainable Development Strategy for 2013-2017. It concludes that traditional and emerging donors do not represent homogeneous groups; for Kyrgyzstan, differences within the group can be as significant as differences among the groups. Moreover, the analysis does not support the notion that assistance from traditional donors has greater effectiveness. On some parameters including alignment emerging donors' assistance can be more effective. Nonetheless, serious gaps between the two groups remain in terms of transparency, mutual accountability and harmonization. The author also explores the stronger bargaining positions of aid recipient in their interactions with donors due to the increased diversity of sources of assistance, focusing on this trend in Kyrgyzstan. Given Kyrgyzstan's position as a priority for Russia's assistance and Russia's rapidly increasing levels of support, the author also addresses the case of Russian-Kyrgyz Development Fund in detail.","Aid effectiveness; Development assistance; Emerging donors; Kyrgyzstan; Russia; Traditional donors",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021318306

In this first book to discuss the issue, Vadim Rossman offers an in-depth analysis of the subject, highlighting the global trends and the key factors that motivate different countries to consider such projects, analyzing the outcomes and drawing lessons from recent capital city transfers worldwide for governments and policy-makers. Capital Cities studies the approaches and the methodologies that inform such decisions and debates. Special attention is given to the study of the universal patterns of relocation and patterns specific to particular continents and mega-regions and particular political regimes. The study emphasizes the role of capital city transfers in the context of nation- and state-building and offers a new framework for thinking about capital cities, identifying six strategies that drive these decisions, representing the economic, political, geographic, cultural and security considerations. Confronting the popular hyper-critical attitudes towards new designed capital cities, Vadim Rossman shows the complex motives that underlie the proposals and the important role that new capitals might play in conflict resolution in the context of ethnic, religious and regional rivalries and federalist transformations of the state, and is seeking to identify the success and failure factors and more efficient implementation strategies. Drawing upon the insights from spatial economics, comparative federalist studies, urban planning and architectural criticism, the book also traces the evolution of the concept of the capital city, showing that the design, iconography and the location of the capital city play a critical role in the success and the viability of the state. © 2017 Vadim Rossman.",,,"English",Book,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020769158

Current research is another attempt to understand these changes. The aim of this research was to define the nature of cohabitations in Russia, and find out the factors of entrance to non-marital unions. For these purposes, we used Event History Analysis and Sequence Analysis. The key requirement in using these methods is applying longitudinal or retrospective collections of data that have become the gold standard of current quantitative social science. Accordingly, the three-wave panel data of the Russian part of «Generations and Gender Survey» and the retrospective data of «Person, Family, Society» were chosen for this study. The opposite trends of matrimonial behavior were revealed: the younger Russian people are, the higher their probabilities to start the first cohabitation and the lower their risks to have the first marriage. Cohabitation is not a complete alternative to marriage in our country yet, but the proportion of Russians, for whom cohabitation does not grow into a marriage, rises, and young people start to consider a non-marital union appropriate for child-bearing. It is a sign that cohabitation is close to become an independent social institution for young non-religious people who get secondary vocational education in big cities.","Cohabitation; Event history analysis; First marital unions; Life course; Marriage; Second demographic transition; Sequence analysis",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020425627

The most popular deproblematization strategies are 'anti-patterning', 'telling anecdote' and 'counter-rhetoric of insincerity', as defined by Ibarra and Kitsuse. The discourse intensity on this issue is remarkable. For example, the Russian food embargo is more noticeable in the public space than sanctions.

Does high inequality hamper the adoption of reforms that contribute to the development of the industrial sector? In the present paper, we demonstrate that the lack of consensus about the role of inequality in the long-run growth could be attributed to not considering the fundamental differences between land inequality and capital inequality, and the differential effects they exert on the process of political struggle accompanying industrialization in most countries worldwide. We propose a two-sector unified growth model, in which the speed of industrialization depends on the outcome of political conflict between the heterogeneous interest groups, differing with respect to capital and land ownership, over the adoption of reform of the modern sector. The growth of productivity in the modern sector is possible only if the supporters of this reform manage to overcome the resistance of its opponents in the process of lobbying their interests. The distribution of capital and land is crucial in this process since it determines the structure of agents' incomes and, hence, their political preferences and incentives to invest in lobbying for (or against) the reform. We demonstrate that higher concentration of land ownership hampers development of the modern sector, while higher concentration of capital ownership within the landless agents increases political support of pro-growth reforms and intensifies industrialization. Moreover, the strength of the latter effect is increasing with the accumulation of the aggregate capital. Finally, our model explains the non-monotonous dynamics of political conflict intensity, which corresponds well with structural changes and GDP per capita growth observed in historical data.","Industrialization; Political conflict; Unified growth theory; Wealth distribution",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019893447

Anthropologists tie it with alternative marriage arrangements, characteristic of those systems where marriages are arranged by parents; historians tend to view the abduction of women as part of early history of developed nations, mostly the Middle Ages. In Russia, recent historiographical discussion of abductions always starts with descriptions of customary practices in Siberia to highlight the steppe and frontier experiences in the framework of colonization and underline 'savage' or 'backwardness' of Siberian populations. However, scholars almost never talk about the abduction of women within the European part. In this article, female abductions are analyzed within the framework of citizenship and modernization of the Russian Empire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It focuses on the notion of consent and how it contributed to the founding of a new social unit, that is the family, in which women and men acquired their rights and duties in relation to outside society and wider polity. The lack of consent jeopardized the legitimacy of such a union and compromized the citizenship status of its members. On its way to build the country as a modern empire, Russian authorities localized the abduction of women as a 'customary' practice of 'backwards' people to preserve the modern European core of the Empire. © 2017 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","abduction; bride price; citizenship; consent; rape; Russia; Siberia",,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018572988

The flogging of political prisoner Bogolyubov following Trepov's illegal order made Zasulich desperate to take revenge in order to alert Russian society of the humiliating arbitrariness and the unfairness of the political and legal structures of late Imperial Russia. Her victimization highlighted her ""moral right"" to act as a defendant of true law and legality in Russia.

Chalmers came to the conclusion that consciousness is redundant in relation to the brain functioning and he called it the hard problem of consciousness. In this article a fusion of existentialism and quantum theories of consciousness will be proposed, with the result being a neurophenomenological theory of consciousness Quantum brain and Nothingness. An important base for the paper is the idea of direct connection between the hard problem of consciousness and the problem of free will that allows us to build a “bridge” between existential philosophy and the hard problem of consciousness. The main ideas of neurophenomenological theory of consciousness will contain the following: At present moment brain can be simultaneously in multiple states, because of the significant quantum effects that influencing neuron impulses. From the third person’s perspective the quantum brain looks like physical object, but in reality (i.e. “from the inside”, “brain for brain” or brain as “thing-in-itself”) quantum brain is consciousness. It means that the conscious and quantum neuronal processes are the same “something” that can be observed both from inside and from outside. Because of that consciousness exists simultaneously in multiple states. Further free “i” in the continuously processes of selection of one of the possible state of consciousness and automatically chooses one of the possible state of the quantum brain, causing collapse of its wave function as a result. Furthermore, consciousness is “quantum brain for quantum brain” and “i” that is in the continuous process of collapsing of brain’s wave function. Quantum states of brain are pressuring “i” requiring its own realization. This “pressure” and particular quantum states of the brain are represented as multitude of qualia for “i”. As a result, consciousness is emergent interaction of “i” and quantum states of the brain. © 2016, E-FLOW PDF NeuroQuantology.

The article aims to reveal the meaning of the term in different scientific and philosophical interpretations. The term ""meme"" was introduced by Richard Dawkins, who tried to embed culture into his theory of gene evolution. Hence, its meaning was similar to ""gene"" in Richard Dawkins's interpretation. The term became popular in research, in culture, in popular science, and in the sphere of common sense. It is often used to describe online phenomena of funny pictures and phrases that spread quickly. The scientific use of the term supposes a specific ideological background. It is atheistic, technocratic, media-oriented and depicts the human being as a prosumer. This approach is not as developed in the fields of anthropology or sociology, yet it became widely used in research related to viral news or messages diffusion. The article claims that meme popularity is part of an attempt to conceptualize text and context in a new way, stressing the pragmatic aspects of messages exchanges. This claim builds on Marshall McLuhan's and other media theorists' idea of communication. The content of memes is similar to what Claude Lévi-Strauss called ""bricolage,"" and the social situation refers to Benjamin's mechanical reproduction. Finally, the meme is compared to theories of popularity and celebrities, and is recognized as a conceptual language to describe the practice of consumption that is close to production. The key feature of meme in this context is that it does not produce new meanings; it only reproduces old ones.","Celebrity; Claude LéVI-Strauss; Internet; Meme; Richard Dawkins; Stoned fox; Walter Benjamin",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018349986

The first part of the article provides a brief historical account of the beginning of modernity, when the cultural phenomenon of persons famous for something other than their military achievements, their inheritance, or their artistic talents first emerges. This part of the article addresses the heyday of cinema and television, i.e. the period between the start of the 19th century and the latter half of the 20th century. The second part of the article is dedicated to celebrities as objects of contemporary cultural and social research. As a discipline, celebrity studies is a relatively new sphere in US and UK universities, but an increasing number of researchers are taking up the study of celebrities each year. This is due to the fact that celebrities often embody a non-articulated public mood, and also because modern celebrity culture is based on the capitalization of names and thus perfectly illustrates many key processes taking in the cultural industry today. The article concludes by examining the phenomenon of internet celebrities, who used the representation of everyday practices in order to gain the attention of their audiences. This is a comparatively new phenomenon that has not been fully examined by academics. This phenomenon occurs when there is a reduction of design, expressed in the demonstration of sincerity and simplicity, resulting in a new sort of self-design. The audience's demand for simplicity and naive sincerity generates two new trends that will prevail in the culture of celebrities in the coming years. On the one hand, stars will bet on the expansion of demonstrations of everyday life practices. On the other hand, new applications and platforms will emerge that are specifically designed to preserve privacy and the ability to participate in one-way data transmission without interactive connections with fans.","Attention economics; Celebrity; Commonplace; Fame; Mass media; Popular culture; Social networks",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018239764

As a form of such involvement, non-profit organizations (NPOs) can be established to support educational institutions. In this paper, we assess the level of collective co-production in Russian school education and look for correlations between institutional characteristics of schools and their cooperation with NPOs. The data for the research was obtained from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities (through the SPARK System), websites of local departments of education, and publicly available sources of information about activities of NPOs supporting schools. We reveal considerable cross-regional differences in the development of collective co-production in school education. The process is more active in provincial towns than in megalopolises: The proportion of schools supported by specifically founded NPOs is higher in many regional centers than in the capital cities. At the same time, a lot of regions have no such NPOs at all. As it turns out, NPOs are more likely to be created to support schools with a special status (gymnasiums, lyceums and specialized schools), where the parental demand for quality education services is higher. Meanwhile, we found no correlation between autonomous status of educational institutions and their participation in collective co-production. Thus, the increased degree of independence did not induce cooperation with NPOs for the purpose of raising extra-budgetary funds in this case.","Autonomous educational institution; Co-production; Demand for education services; Gymnasium; Lyceum; Non-profit organization; School; Specialized school",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017153701

University students brought before the Professors' Disciplinary Court were charged with breaking administrative rules (most often rioting and being drunk in the street) and the university code (from passing on an I D badge to a third party to forging a professor's signature).","20th-century history of Russia; Alltagsgeschichte; History of higher education; Professors' disciplinary court; Student movement",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017095030

We regard student engagement as the opposite of academic dishonesty and propose a conceptual model of how academic honesty at the university influences various aspects of student engagement in learning activities. We conduct an empirical study totest the hypothesis on the correlation between the characteristics of honesty at the university and parameters of student engagement suggested as part of the conceptual model. We use data collected by the Monitoring of Student Characteristics and Trajectories carried out in universities included in the Russian Association of Leading Universities in Economics and Management.

The origins of this myth are discovered in Late Imperial Russia. Over the first decades of the twentieth century, through the early Soviet period, the Tajik Aryan myth would transform from a narrative legitimizing Russian imperial rule to a myth of Tajik national identity. The article shows how Tajikistan’s imagining and formation as a nation-state was inextricably linked to the Aryan myth andto the way it was articulated by imperial scholars-turned-Soviet orientalists, such as Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Semenov (1873-1958). Taking the microhistorical perspective of a single life allows the author to highlight the local Central Asian dynamics of the complex imperial situation that paved the way to and accompanied Bolshevik nationalities policy. As a scholar with a certain political weight, Semenov managed to exploit the leeway for action in accordance with his own research interests (rather than acting as a mere instrument of the imperial and Soviet regimes in Central Asia). Consequently, the article argues that the process of delimiting borders and identities in 1920s Central Asia was influenced not only by Moscow-based Bolsheviks and leading Central Asian Muslim political figures but also by Russian orientalists as distinctive historical actors. © 2016, Ab Imperio.

Basing on the data of survey of 1-11th grade students' parents conducted in 2013 in Moscow by Institute of Megalopolis Human Development (IMHD), three different types of risks are identified. The first type is intra-school risks which include dissatisfaction with characteristics of schools (educational programs and teaching staff as well as ethnic composition of school classes). According to the data, this sort of risks affects 67% of families with schoolchildren in Russian capital. The second type - intra-household risks - covers risks of lacking household resources. Approximately 39% of respondents declare at least a component of such risks. Third type - external risks - concerns indicators of child-friendliness in the urban space. About 83% of parents fear street crime on the way to school or lacking reciprocity among citizens. A special attention is paid to the intersection of different risks and concentration of intra-school, intra-household and external risks in the minds of respondents. It should be pointed out that more than half of schoolchildren's parents do not find any risk in the context of education.

I examine whether Neoclassical Price Theory (NPT) has caused this result. To identify the concept in the case law, I explain how market power, cost tests, and recoupment analysis derive from the NPT concepts of rationality, competition, and efficiency. Competition and efficiency refer to the state of the market in perfect competition relative to monopoly, and thus explicate how predation can harm consumers. Rationality refers to profitability, consumer harm, and the incentive to predate. The concepts create a conceptual framework through which the legal elements assist in predicting the effects of predation. I reviewed all published US federal appellate decisions considering predation from 1950 to 2014. I also examine on what effects judges have focused, whether such effects depart from NPT, and the relationship between effects and plaintiffs’ success rate. Brooke Group defined effects as recoupment, and plaintiffs subsequently have won a single published case. Because the Supreme Court viewed predation as rarely successful and the claim itself as systemically inhibiting pricecuts, lower courts have interpreted cost and market power evidence within the confines of NPT, but strictly.

This impact depended on the industrial composition of employment, industrial wage premiums, and intra-industry wage differentiation. Calculations based on various Rosstat data sources suggest that all three factors contributed to the narrowing of wage inequality. Proportion of employment in the highest and lowest paying industries tended to shrink, compressing the wage distribution from the both tales. Wages in these industries approached the averages for the whole economy. At the same time, the intra-industry wage differentiation measured by Gini coefficients contracted as well. Observed dynamics in cross-industrial inequality can survive in medium term perspective. Lower hydrocarbon prices are likely to affect negatively the wage paying capacity of firms in this sector, thus compressing relative wages. The same can happen in the crisisridden financial sector. If upward pressures on wages in the budgetary sector do not disappear, relative wages here will grow bringing an equalizing effect on the total wage distribution.","Cross-industry differentiation; Inequality; Wages",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012925108

It was supposed that positive emotional state and dispositional joy heighten the speed of positive information processing and don't influence processing of the stimuli with negative emotional coloring. Testing of the emotion induction procedure proved it to be partially successful. Congruency effect for dispositional joy was achieved: we found an interrelation of higher manifestation of this trait with higher speed in joy recognition from facial expressions.

The second criterion is the aspect which third party emphasizes in the process of solving a conflict - the relations between disputants and their emotions, or the result of a conflict. Hence, a classification of the third party's intervention strategies in solving interpersonal conflicts can be presented. For example, when a third party's activity is high and the third party emphasizes the relations between disputants and their emotions in the process of solving a conflict, the third party's intervention strategies are facilitative, evaluative, transformative, as well as mediation strategies. When the third party's activity is high and the third party emphasizes the outcome of a conflict, the third party's intervention strategies are pressing, directive, arbitration, problem-solving, and deal-making. Then, when the third party's activity is low and the third party emphasizes the relations between disputants and their emotions in the process of solving conflicts, the third party's intervention strategies are differentiated, narrative, storytelling, and understanding-based. Finally, when third party's activity is low and the third party emphasizes the result of a conflict, the third party's intervention strategies are analytic, neutral, strategic, pragmatic, as well as orchestration strategies.

The macroeconomic analysis shows that this process is due to the differences in salaries, the weak equalizing effect of social transfers and new sources of income such as the income from property and of business activity. We have a poor understanding of the factors determining this inequality at the household level so far. Decomposition of equivalised household expenditure inequality into inter- and intra-groups using cross-sectional data (RLMS-HSE, 1994-2014) shows that during the whole research period one of the most significant factors of intergroup inequality is region of residence. During periods of high economic growth the significance of education and intensity of employment increased in intergroup inequality; however, during the period of economic stagnation the intergroup differentiation of educational potential began to decrease. Despite the important population policy aimed to increase the birth rate, children in families have become the most significant factor of intergroup inequality for the last years. A regression analysis of the determinants of inequality, which allows us to estimate the contribution of each factor to the model dispersion of per capita expenditure allows us to draw the conclusion that meritocratic factors explain a majority of observed inequality. The contribution of the child-burden factor to total inequality did not change during the past ten years, and at the same time, the inequality-decreasing effect of the presence of pensioners in households has continuously increased.","Human capital; Income and wages inequality; Wealth and poverty",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012876625

Graeber studies the moral dimension of markets and develops a powerful tool for concrete analysis of contemporary economy in its relation to power, inequality, and international politics. The book takes for its main objective an explanation of why we tend to believe that 'one has to pay one's debts' regardless of circumstances. A historical-anthropological investigation demonstrates that money debts are closely linked to both expansion of markets and strengthening of states. The book is addressed to a wide audience; however, it is also a highly valuable source for anthropologists, sociologists, historians and political philosophers. In the published book review, G.

Fluctuations in income from profits, shares, rents during crisis may temporarily reduce inequality, but the periods of prosperity naturally increase income inequality. Social inequality has a serious impact on economic growth and social stability in the country, but with a significant increase in income and consumption levels of the poor population in the XX-XXI centuries inequality in itself might not cause social unrest.

Using hierarchical cluster analysis and confirmatory factor analysis with cross-validation in an independent sample, we arrived at a set of 36 items grouped into 4 scales and 12 subscales (corresponding to theoretical prerequisites of fundamental motivations). The scales demonstrate acceptable reliability (in the .79-.88 range, .93 for the general score). We sought evidence of convergent and discriminant validity of the scales by using correlational and multiple regression analyses of their associations with indicators of emotional, social, and psychological well-being, subjective happiness, satisfaction with life, basic psychological need satisfaction, self-esteem, internal locus of control, as well as alienation and psychopathology. The findings support the convergent validity of existential fulfillment indicators against well-being measures based on different theoretical approaches, as well as discriminant validity of specific existential fundamental motivation scales.

The significance of this concept for development of Social Identity Theory and understanding of intergroup relations is discussed. Contradictions that were found while testing the interrelations between ingroup identification, ingroup favoritism, attitudes toward outgroups, and self-esteem serve as a starting point for the author's reasoning. In order to find causes of such contradictions and possible ways of their solving the author performed theoretical analysis of methodological and empirical research based on Social Identity Theory, as well as functional analysis in related areas. Based on this analysis two suggestions were made. Firstly, Social Identity Theory implicitly contains two meanings of social identity that could lead to discrepancies in empirical results. On the one hand, identity is regarded as just an intermediate element between categorization and comparison, on the other hand, identity is a substantive phenomenon supported by the range of management strategies. Secondly, identity management strategies could specify functions that iden tity carries out for both an individual and a group. Nevertheless, Social Identity Theory focuses only on those functions that identity carries out for the individual himself. Shifting the focus toward functions that identity executes for a group leads to new suggestions about the initial contradictions. First of all, this leads to doubts in personal self-esteem enhancement as the only ""ultimate goal"" of strong group commitment. Moreover, this leaves the question open, ""at whose expense"" the positivity of identity is maintained in the process of intergroup comparisons. Hence, one can expect that while some identity management strategies bring positive outcomes for outgroup attitudes, other strategies bring negative outcomes, which makes identity management strategies a crucial explanatory construct for the study of intergroup relations.","Identity management strategies; Intergroup relations; Social identity functions; Social identity theory",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012247642

The effect consists in missing the second target stimulus after a successful detection of the first in a visual search task. One of the theories links the effect to the fact that the detected first stimulus exhausts the resource of the working memory and thus blocks the search. In our study we used a standard working memory task which consisted in memorizing one digit (low working memory load) or six digits (high working memory load) with a subsequent report. A visual search task consisted in looking for the letters T among letters L. There might have been one or two Ts or none at all. The subjects' task in each trial was to identify the Ts while retaining the information about the digital task in the working memory. The experiment revealed meaningful significance of the number of stimuli, but the factors of the working memory load and interference of stimuli were insignificant. Thus the degree of the effect of ""misses in continued search"" (the difference between percentage of correct answers in the task with two target stimuli and in the task with one target stimulus) turns out to be the same in all trials irrespective of high or low loading of the working memory. Comparison of the findings of the study with other research data allows a conclusion that the effect of misses is either not linked to working memory or is linked to another memory sub-system. The study also revealed a link between the effect of misses and the number of search stimuli, i.e. the perceptive load of the system of information processing.","Effect of ""misses in continued search""; Visual attention; Visual search; Working memory",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012241804

On the basis of documents from the archives of the Medical Council of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and periodicals, the author traces the search for relevant organizational and self-organization models for Russian doctors. The views of government officials and the professional medical elite differed significantly. For government reformers, doctors were a group of officials called upon to instill social control and to provide medical assistance to the population. As such, they were treated as comparable to other similar classes of employees. At the same time, they possessed complex knowledge, which complicated the doctors’ management. In this regard, the “medical mission” (later the department) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Police and the Ministry of Education were supplemented by the Medical Councils - advisory bodies consisting of “renowned doctors”. Due to the concentration of highest state authorities, elite military units and higher medical schools in Saint Petersburg, the capital’s doctors (mainly military surgeons and physicians in ordinary) became the administrators of the Russian medical class. German-speaking doctors, involved in public administration in their Russian service, created at the beginning of the 19th century a society of German doctors - a kind of elite professional club. A change in the ethnic composition of the medical community due to the development of medical education contributed in the 1830s to the emergence of health administrators and physicians in ordinary of Russian origin. Competition with German tutors and other social issues resulted in the creation of the Society of Russian Physicians, the goal of which was the unification of Russian doctors into a professional medical community. © Elena A.

The next article (Part 2) will contain an investigation of the categories of a community (communitas), communication, and society (societas). I stress the immediate readiness of the question in existing Thomistic literature. Despite the active investigations of Aquinas's political theory, the social theory remains almost forgotten. The works of Ignatius Th. Eschmann, Yves Congar, and Jeremy Catto represent some exclusions from this assertion, but not one of them has paid enough attention to the terminological peculiarities of Thomistic thought. Between the main results of this work, it is worth to focus on the next aspects of the dissipation of the people's concept, its equalization with the multitude, and the break of the connection between the notions of a people and a Commonwealth. The populus in Thomas's theory loses its political nature ascribed to it by Cicero and Augustin. Having lost its subjectivity, the People convert into an organized multitude united by common territory and the same mode of every-day life. Aquinas ignores the creation of the Commonwealth by the People and establishes a connection of another type between these concepts. According to him, the People is a kind of Aristotelian ""materia,"" while the Commonwealth is the ""form."" In compliance with the precedential assertion, the Respublica becomes eternal and unchangeable, where only the content-i.e., the People or the multitude-can change. In effect, Aquinas formulates the concept of the proto-State here. © Centre for Fundamental Sociology, 2016.","Commonwealth; Multitude; Populus; Respublica; Social theory; The People; Thomas Aquinas",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010955859

Russian researchers rarely focus on the Russian prison system as a whole, or on women's experiences in colonies, female identities, and punishment practices in particular. These topics therefore remain marginalized, out of the spotlight of critical public debate and sociological research. The present article contributes to the current debate on the meaning and consequences of close relations in women's colonies, varying in context from friendship and love to exploitation under the tough control of the gender regime from both the prison administration and the informal system of power typical of a prison hierarchy. The female body becomes an additional mechanism of supporting the repressive nature of a penal colony, strengthening patriarchal traditions, and maintaining a high level of homophobia in Russian society as a whole. Based on the analysis of 33 in-depth interviews including biographical elements with women between 18 and 55 years old convicted for various crimes, I argue that the gender regime in correctional facilities for women becomes an additional mechanism aimed at strengthening discipline, control, and the patriarchy in a patriarchal society. Whilst the regime is not prescribed by law, it becomes the law because of the extreme objectification of women, the female body, and the status of the female. © Centre for Fundamental Sociology, 2016.","Female body; Gender; Intimacy; Patriarchal gender regime; Russian prison system; Sexuality; Women's colonies",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010934706

His starting point is Greek philosophy, specifically Plato's and Aristotle's views on friendship. He adds significant nuances to the understanding of friendship that were first laid down in his doctrine of philosophical hermeneutics. It allows him to place the notion of friendship in the context of modern philosophical debate and social criticism, and thus to make an original contribution to the discussion. Gadamer understands friendship as a necessarily reciprocal structure. He emphasizes the fact that only reciprocity or a kind of relation to someone other than ""me"" can serve as a sufficient basis for the explanation of the possibility of a community, as opposed to neo-Kantian and a phenomenological adherence to self-consciousness. The notion of friendship is closely connected to the notion of solidarity. The first one is considered as a more universal and thus grounding type of interpersonal communication, whereas natural solidarity is a specific kind of bond that can grow into the true friendship. Furthermore, friendship is seen as an accession of being (Zuwachs an Sein) from a teleological point of view, i.e., the true friendship is a contribution to and the realization of life. The outcome of this practice cannot be differentiated from its process. © Centre for Fundamental Sociology, 2016.","Friendship; Gadamer; Increase in being; Philosophical hermeneutics; Practical philosophy; Solidarity; Understanding",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010934379

It shows that while the ideal of fathers heavily involved in day-to-day parenting is widespread, the reality is somewhat different despite the active participation of Russian mothers in the labor market. Still, for most Russian men, fathering as a set of everyday practices of engaging with their children has more value than for the generation of their fathers. The research shows that modern Russian society can be characterized by the co-existence of egalitarian and traditional tendencies in gender relations. On the one hand, the practices of involved fathering are evolving, and on the other hand, the traditional patterns of masculinity are enforced, excluding fathers from the sphere of parenthood. Economic factors and rigid notions about the family gender contract are the main obstacles which prevent Russian men from ""doing"" involved fatherhood. The liberal phenomenon of ""new fatherhood"" which appeared in Western countries turned out to be much more conservative in Russia. The modern family is still the ""space of struggle,"" and this struggle is counter-directed: It can be a fight for survival, or for power, or for an egalitarian gender order, against the discrimination of men as secondary parents, against old-fashioned traditional views on the father's and the mother's roles in the family, or for the preservation of those views. © Centre for Fundamental Sociology, 2016.","Fatherhood; Fathering practices; Gender contract; Involved fatherhood; Masculinity; Parenthood",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010931316

It aims to uncover the specific features of pride in the social security system by estimating the effects of various factors based on cross-national evidence from the International Social Survey Program - National Identity and multiple country-level measurements of social policies. The results show that the level of pride in the social security system is higher than pride in other socioeconomic achievements and has higher variance at the aggregated country level. The higher variance is due to the country-specific objective characteristics of the social sphere, especially those directly related to material well-being, and also to the expectations formed by the past: The socialist legacy negatively affects pride in the social security system even more strongly than other facets of pride. The strongest individual-level factors affecting pride in the social security are those directly related to social inequality. Pride is lower among those who are more vulnerable and dependent on social policies (generally women rather than men) and those who bear the costs (full-Time employed as main taxpayers). On the other hand, it is higher among those who might appreciate its necessity in ideological terms (the better educated) and need it less (those with higher subjective social status). This outcome shows an important discrepancy in evaluations: Those with a greater impact on policymaking have a more op timistic view of the social security system than those whom it primarily affects. These results have important policy implications as they suggest that, by presenting social policy issues in a more positive manner and specifically targeting past-oriented expectations, policymakers can foster public understanding and involvement. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.","Elite Achievements; Mass Achievements; National Pride; Social Policies; Social Security System",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009143804

Parenting culture is a set of care practices that are embedded within the certain meanings and ideological contexts of both a particular social group and society in general. Professionalization can be conceptualised as a process whereby expert knowledge (medical, psychological, pedagogical) penetrates into the everyday practice of child care. The professionalization of parenting involves a variety of actors: The mass media, social policy, public and independent experts of childhood. In this article we examine self-help literature for parents as one of the agents in the parenthood professionalization process. Handbooks published for parents represent one part of an expert knowledge system that has been adapted for mass readers and contains criticism of everyday and conventional ideas about childcare. On the basis of methodology used to assess the popularity of books, such as the number of published copies, readership levels on parent Internet-forums and the evaluation of sealed copies by vendors, a sample of fifteen Russian books was formed. Employing the use of discourse analysis, the meaning behind the responsibility zones of experts and parents is reconstructed in these popular books. The authors found and conceptualized three types of parent professionalization in these books. Firstly, there is professionalization based on individual experience, which prioritize individual, often biologically defined, care practices as the basis of knowledge about the child. This corresponds to the institutionalized, standard expert view of a 'normal child'. Secondly, we found professionalization based on expert knowledge. This type of professionalization is found in books where the experts are prior agents in signifying parenting practices. Parent's specific knowledge and everyday understandings are ignored or presented as harmful and dangerous for child. The knowledge and practices of childcare are medicalized and related to treatment and hygiene. Thirdly, there is professionalization based on 'common sense'. This type of professionalization is based on critical reflection that parents should undertake, both in relation to the expert's advice and everyday notions about good childcare. In conclusion, we consider why these three types of professionalization are popular in a Russian context. It can be argued that the current neo-liberal trend in social policy strengthens the demand for parents handbooks. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.","Parenthood; Parenting Culture; Professionalization",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009115365

The theoretical framework is based on interactions between concepts such as social closure, autonomy and professionalization. This framework helps analyse some of the parameters of status among professional homeopaths, namely the economic, power-related and socio-cultural aspects. This analysis is based on qualitative and quantitative data obtained from semi-structured interviews with homeopaths (N=22) and a survey conducted by the author at the Annual Moscow Conference of Homeopathy (N=149), as well as information gained in the course of the secondary data analysis. The survey was used, in part, to clarify and add to the questions that had arisen in the interviews. In order to define the level of individual autonomy among homeopaths we developed quantitative indicators. The data demonstrates that the economic status of Russian homeopathy specialists is relatively low, that professional associations play a limited role in the self-regulation of the group, and that the mechanisms of social closure are weak. All this hinders the professionalization of homeopaths. Nonetheless, homeopaths find a sufficiently high level of individual autonomy as homeopathic practice is not strictly standardised. Today homeopaths as a group face the choice between two professionalization strategies. One is the standardisation of homeopathy, which, although permitting better integration within conventional medicine, threatens ordinary homeopathy practices with a loss of autonomy. The other professionalization strategy rejects standardisation and integration, instead focusing on the preservation of the unique identity and autonomy of the practice. The choice of strategies is a dilemma for homeopaths as each option possesses its own advantages and restrictions. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.","Complementary And Alternative Medicine; Homeopathy; Profession; Professionalization; Russian Healthcare",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009094271

The choice and recognition of the genre become an aesthetic problem for both the author and the audience. Discrepancies and genre inconsistencies smoothed by vigorous rhetoric are the key structural principle of the trilogy. The pool of characters turns into a full-blown accusatory remark, a showdown and a sentence to all who were guilty before Sukhovo-Kobylin. The trilogy itself is a rigorous statement of historical and personal circumstances and the freak of fate that broke his life once and forever. The inter-play continuity of the trilogy is provided by temporal indicators (""six years later"") and the balance between old and new characters. The guises familiar to the audience undergo transformations, sprouting the seeds of tragedy and tragifarce seen in the first play. The signs of a total disaster piling up in the second part turn out to be a jeering anecdote, a lampoon, a mockery of life and death, and an alternate substitution of a dead man for a living one and vice versa.

Today, identification of various genres in each play of the trilogy as well as in the whole dramatic cycle, requires a wider range of sources. The choice of a specific genre always has to do with Sukhovo- Kobylin's ideological position. He sees himself as a participant of and witness to the painful processes going on in Russia. The author's development of the genre conception and its philosophical underpinning have not yet been addressed by researchers in this context. Whatever it was he was writing about, Sukhovo-Kobylin always returned to the same speculation about the criminality of the apparatus of the Russian government and the criminal world order. This firm belief was realized in two interrelated forms, two major genres in which he polished his ideas: dramatic trilogy Scenes from the Past and philosophical tractate Uchenie Vsemir [The All-World Doctrine]. It is not so much synthesis as syncretism of genres in Scenes from the Past that we can talk of in the context of regular mental exercises, diary confessions and epistolary documents reflected in comedies Svad'ba Krechinskogo [Krechinsky's Wedding] and Smert' Tarelkina [Tarelkin's Death]. This syncretism is what makes Sukhovo-Kobylin's theater so holistic and his theories so persistently and vividly embodied.","Boundaries of genres; Character; Comedy; Dialogue; Drama; Drama series; Farce; Philosophy; Stage space; System of genres; Transformation; Vaudeville",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009074995

The need for the transition from physicians' visits reimbursement to capitation payment is substantiated. It is argued that the current payment method hinders disease prevention activities, chronic disease management, integration of service delivery as well as a shift of services from inpatient to outpatient settings. The latest regulatory documents on this subject are critically evaluated with the focus on the attempts to combine the capitation method with the fee-for-service one. Alternative approaches aimed at cost containing and strengthening disease prevention are discussed. Versions of fundholding schemes are suggested as well as the ways to mitigate their excessive financial risks. Various options of the pay-for-performance are seen as the necessary addition to the fundholding scheme. Problems of the capitation rate development under the fundholding are reviewed. It is argued that the budget of a fundholder should include only a manageable part of the inpatient care cost. The methods of planning primary health care utilization should also change - from the current planning of the number of a physician's visits to the planning of the size of a catchment area in terms of the number of residents served by primary health care providers.

What are the major advantages and disadvantages of these mechanisms? What is the role of social partners in setting the MWs at the regional level? And most important - what problems may be solved by the regionalization of the MWs? Based on the practice of the MW regionalization, we divide countries into four groups. However, the prevailing method is the coexistence of the national minimum wage floor set by the federal government and regional minimum wages.

An analysis of the strategies for increasing efficiency of cultural heritage sites is based on the empirical research of the historical country estates, located in Moscow region. To estimate the development perspectives of the historical country estates in Moscow region, we used cluster analysis methods and defined four clusters that are characterized by diff erent strategies of the cultural heritage use and their development perspectives. To assess cost eff ectiveness of the historical estates, we developed normative and dynamic models; the calculations made with the use of the models resulted in a list of the historical estates that have prospects for re-development and transformation into cultural and educational centers. Proposed strategies for the development of cultural heritage sites are built upon variable-based calculations of their investment attractiveness, introducing specific economic parameters that could be acceptable to potential investors, with increasing costs of repair and restoration works taken into account.

The analysis of urban youth consumption draws on the data of a research project; its empirical basis consists of sixty semi-structured interviews conducted with two generations of young people in St. Petersburg (20-25 and 30-35 years old) with different job tenure (no more than five years and about ten years) and from different fields of employment: the public sector (budget-funded organisations), the private sector (commercial companies) and self-employment (freelancers). Our particular attention to the changes in young people’s financial and time budgeting practices stems from the hypothesis that they are the main manifestations of youth’s first reactions to the crisis.

Second, elaborating the adequate research tools for studying the ethical dimension of globalizing social reality. We conduct a critical analysis of the current literature on these issues from the Global Sociology perspective. We show that the ‘value-involved’ Global Sociology is the only possible mode of successful and appealing international disciplinary practice. However, existing ‘value-involved’ approaches are Eurocentric by nature and lack sensitivity to the ethically diverse global social reality. We propose the conceptual framing of ‘Ethically Responsible Global Sociology’ as a new vision of our discipline in the global world. © Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2016.","Ethics in sociology; Global Sociology; Globalization; Value-involved sociology",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007286556

We compare benefits and shortcomings of the models discussed. We confirm that there is no “silver bullet”, i.e. a universal lifecycle model equally applicable to any software product. Consequently, lifecycle model choice is dependent upon product size and scope; each project requires a unique combination of features. In crisis, we recommend to combine prototyping with the other models that we discussed in order to achieve a common understanding of the key product features and to reduce project risks. The lifecycle model choice determines project economics, time to market, product quality and overall project success. However, the product success essentially depends on human factors, which include common vision of the critical product functions, transparent communication and feedback. We analyze applicability of the lifecycle models to large-scale, mission-critical software systems, which is essential in crisis. Finally, we introduce a methodology, which includes a spiral-like lifecycle and a set of formal models and visual tools for software product development. The methodology helps to optimize the software product lifecycle, which is mission-critical in crisis.

The reformers had a rather vague vision of the future state as a single mechanism assembled out of rationally identified individual functions. It was to replace the older imperial state composed of an assortment of self-governing blocs of territorial or “thematic” responsibilities. Medicine was identified as one of the main types of modern expert knowledge that should be used in the reconfiguration of the state, which explains the centrality of it to the reforms, and the surprisingly chaotic history of finding a proper arrangement for medical expertise within the new government structure. As it turned out, the very field of medicine in the Russian Empire lacked any internal professional cohesion due to the lack of locally trained cadres, institutional underdevelopment, and, most important, the absence of any common culture of professional solidarity. Therefore, state building went hand in hand with professionalization, and they enhanced each other along the way. Any new step toward the formalization of governance had a direct impact on structuring the medical profession, and vice versa. In the process, they developed the very discourse of modern governance based on expert knowledge and discipline, which was not exclusively “statist” or “professional” in nature. Eventually, the medicalization of public discourse resulted in producing a new concept of authority as based not on the political sovereignty (of the emperor) and not on the seniority of status (of the elite circle of physicians) but on the expertise provided by a qualified professional. The unsettled nature of the modern Russian state, still lacking a developed class of bureaucracy and formalized procedures (or even, until the 1830s, codified law), made the reform of government-regulated health highly protracted and haphazard. The professionalization of physicians had directly influenced the professionalization (institutionalization and bureaucratization) of the state through the transfer of practices and values. By looking at the history of “regulatory agreement” between the state and professionals and bringing previously unknown sources into the discussion, the author of the article reads the zigzagging path of institutional development as a story of the complex process of self-organization of the modern state and the medical profession behind the facade of administrative arbitrariness. © 2016, Ab Imperio.

It will be argued that Article 168 of the Russian Civil Code, as a metarule, contains three types of rule: 1) rules dealing with the priority of special rules and exceptions (exclusive rules); 2) rules dealing with the interpretation of general, special and exclusive rules, as well as with the requirements of statutes or other legal acts violated by a transaction and established outside of Article 168 of the Civil Code; 3) rules dealing with the admissibility of special rules and exceptions, as well as with the conditions of admissibility of these rules. With regard to the first group of rules, the legislature and commercial courts consider Article 168 of the Civil Code a common base for other grounds in the Civil Code, and in certain other statutes, for declaring transactions invalid. According to the second group of rules, the subject-matter (object) of legal interpretation consists of two elements: а) the text of Article 168 of the Civil Code; and b) the texts of legal acts, described by the generic term “statute or other legal act.” Article 168 of the Civil Code provides instructions, not only for rules as objects of application of the article, but also for the methods of interpreting violated requirements. The rules of admissibility for special rules and exceptions, as well as the conditions of admissibility for these standards, are aimed at the numerous cases in which the legislature, in the Civil Code or in other legal acts, expressly establishes nullity (voidness), voidability and other legal consequences for illegal transactions. The paper also answers questions regarding the impact of recent amendments to the Russian Civil Code on the use, by commercial courts, of rules on business transaction invalidity. © 2016, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

Agents whose behavior has just one possible future have determined causal status, while agents whose behavior may vary in the future have undetermined causal status. The structure of the world or local determinism may govern an agent's causal status. It is claimed that according to extended mind hypothesis agents with different causal statuses may coexist in the world. The extended mind hypothesis states that artifacts located outside of human bodies may perform cognitive functions and we must recognize them as parts of a human cognitive system. Those artifacts may be either determined or undetermined. In both cases, according to the extended mind hypothesis, they are going to be parts of the human cognitive system. Therefore, with respect to cognitive functions performed by those artifacts, agents have different causal statuses. It is easy to imagine a situation in which various people use determined and undetermined devices simultaneously and are considered free in the same manner.

It briefly examines contemporary libertarian theories of free will, provides criticism of agent-causal theories, and discusses the innovative character of Robert Kane's theory of Ultimate Responsibility. Hard incompatibilism is criticized because of its methodological deficiencies in exploring the prospects of living without freedom of will.

The differences pertain to socio-economic status of students as well as to a number of academic outcomes: Achievement on standardized tests, particularly Unified State Exam; percentage of students pursuing higher education; quality of chosen higher education institutions. However it is unknown whether teachers from standard and 'elite' schools do differ. We undertook our study to answer this question. Data and method: Data was collected in St.Petersburg in 2014-2015. In total, we surveyed 769 teachers from 39 schools (18 schools with standard and 21 with advanced curriculum) randomly selected from two city boroughs. The questionnaire included items on education and professional trajectories, social capital, self-efficacy and professional commitment, attitudes towards teaching profession and students, lifestyles, cultural consumption, socio- demographics. We used ANOVA for statistical analysis of differences between categories of teachers, and factor analysis (PCA) for multi-itemed scales. Results and conclusion: In spite of existing differentiation between 'ordinary' and 'elite' schools, differences between their teachers are almost non-existent and concern mainly cultural preferences. Teachers tend to stay in the same school for many years, horizontal mobility is rare. However, mobility between schools of different types occur as often as within the same type. It is important to emphasize that such essential characteristics as self-efficacy, professional commitment, attitudes towards students, disciplinary practices are the same for all teachers regardless the school type or socio-economic composition of schools.

It is argued that they have radically changed the image of Russia as ""primus inter pares"" in the former USSR. Special attention is paid to several key factors which have brought about the new social structure: property relations, the labour market system, the demographic situation and consumer behaviour. All of the related processes and changes are traced using data from Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat). Younger generations of Russians have difficulty understanding the peculiar features of the ""economy of shortage"", just as the generations which grew up during the Soviet era have difficulty understanding today's ""economy of surplus"". Young people believe in the so-called free education and free medical care and social justice in the former USSR. This might explain why the former social and economic system is today being idealized not only by the elderly people, but by the younger generations as well. Moreover, such peculiar nostalgia is spreading because certain social groups (i.e. Soviet intellectuals, who expressed the most scepticism towards socialism, and associated groups are disappearing for demographic reasons, whereas several newly established social groups) (such as entrepreneurs, self-employed and free-lancers) were never even possible in the Soviet economy. The article concludes by evaluating the degree of stability of Russia's new social structure. The recent events of 2014-2016 have demonstrated that a substantial number of Russians appear to be ready to change their perceptions again. The Soviet idea of state prevalence over private initiative which was once rejected in the 1990s is returning to Russians' everyday life.","Consumption behaviour; Demography; Labour market; Property relations; Social and economic changes; Social structure",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002335961

However, the relationship between job loss and subjective social status dynamics remains insufficiently researched. Particularly, little is known about occupation-specific differences in perceptions of social status decline due to job loss. Given occupational heterogeneity, the effect of occupation on subjective social status dynamics due to job loss may differ considerably. The questions raised in this study are the following: For which occupational groups is job loss more damaging in terms of subjective social status decline? Do unemployment transitions differ in terms of their impact on subjective social status decline for various occupational groups? This study utilizes data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey- Higher School of Economics (RLMS-HSE) for 2000-2012. Panel regression models with fixed effects are estimated. The findings reveal a modest negative effect of unemployment on subjective social status. Moreover, this effect is consistently present among male workers who occupy the lower level of the occupation hierarchy (grades 7-9 of the one-digit ISCO88). For job loss the effect, however, is much more pronounced. The decline in subjective social status is particularly pronounced among ex-managers (both male and female) and male workers, who worked as technicians and associate professionals, and for service and sales workers.","Occupations; Panel data; RLMS-HSE; Social stratification; Subjective social status; Unemployment; Worker flows",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002263328

Studying the history of the developed nation-states which have successfully tackled corruption and experienced similar social organizations of shadow practices is a better approach to designing an anti-corruption policy for Russia, rather than simply borrowing foreign practices with little reference to their socio-political development. Drawing upon the Australian experience of police corruption and reform in the 1950s, we suggest anti-corruption policies for the contemporary Russian police force. To do this, we apply an event structure analysis (ESA) to identify the key organizational and institutional factors which contributed to the formation and subsequent dissolution of the First Joke, a corrupt police network which operated in the Queensland Police Force from 1950s-1980s. We design our policy recommendations taking into consideration the particularities of the Russian police and our ESA of the First Joke. Our analysis suggests that curtailing cumbersome state regulations and the over-reliance on police performance evaluation, establishing democratic oversight, improving the current recruitment and selection system, developing community policing alongside further market liberalization and democratization could be effective policies for Russia.","Australia; Corruption; Covert networks; Event structure analysis; Police reform; Russia",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002262296

Our approach differs from the one which is more common among social geographers in that we do not simply equate the group perceptions to the sum of individual perceptions, but regard them as the product of continuous exchanges and interactions between individuals within the group. We analyse this process in a specific group of people: 8th and 9th grade students of a Moscow secondary school, who also interacted with the same age students and the cultures of Ukraine and Poland in the course of school trips. The data for this study were collected in January, 2013 in the form of interviews with the students, and their textual and visual records containing the associations regarding these countries. Our findings reveal that the group perceptions formed in the course of direct interaction with the country and particularly within a single expedition are the most consistent. In our case this is exemplified by contrasting the group perceptions of Ukraine (more consistent) and Belarus (less consistent). In terms of emotional colouring the group perceptions of Ukraine feature the highest degree of neutrality, whereas a small degree of wariness characterizes the perceptions of Belarus and Poland. We conclude that more intense and direct contact with a country (or culture) is more important for the consistency of the perceptions within a group, than more indirect sources (such as, for instance, cultural stereotypes).

The use of simulation games in the educational process allows students to gain a firsthand understanding of the processes of real life. Public administration, public policy, and political science courses increasingly adopt simulation games in universities worldwide. Besides person-to-person simulation games, there are computer-based simulations in public administration education. Currently in Russia the use of computer-based simulation games in Master of Public Administration (MPA) curricula is quite limited. This paper focuses on computer-based simulation games for students of MPA programs. Our aim was to analyze outcomes of implementing such games in MPA curricula. We have done so by (1) developing three computerbased simulation games about allocating public finances, (2) testing the games in the learning process, and (3) conducting a posttest examination to evaluate the effect of simulation games on students' knowledge of municipal finances. This study was conducted in the National Research University Higher School of Economics (HSE) and in the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA) during the period September to December 2015, in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Two groups of students were randomly selected in each university and then randomly allocated either to the experimental or the control group. In control groups (n=12 in HSE, n=13 in RANEPA) students had traditional lectures. In experimental groups (n=12 in HSE, n=13 in RANEPA) students played three simulation games apart from traditional lectures. This exploratory research shows that the use of computer-based simulation games in MPA curricula can improve students' outcomes by 38%. In general, the experimental groups had better performance on the posttest examination (figure 2). Students in the HSE experimental group had 27.5% better scores than students in the HSE control group. Students of the RANEPA experimental group had 38.0% better scores than students in the RANEPA control group. Research indicates that lecture-based courses are less effective than courses with more interactive approaches. Therefore, our study highlights the need to implement computer-based simulation games in MPA programs in Russian universities.

This model expands the arsenal of instrumental methods and allows multivariate production forecasts which are unattainable by other methods of real variables as the functions of complex variables simulate the production differently in comparison with the models of real variables. The values of coefficients of the power production functions of complex variables can be calculated for each statistical observation. This allows to consider the change of the coefficients over time, to analyze this trend and predict the values of the coefficients for a given term, thereby to predict the form of the production function, which forecasts the operating results. Thus, the model of the production function with variable coefficients is introduced into the scientific circulation. With this model, the inverse problem of forecasting might be solved, such as the determination of the necessary quantities of labor and capital to achieve the desired operational results. The study is based on the principles of the modern methodology of complex-valued economy, one of its sections is the complex-valued patterns of production functions. In the article, the possibility of economic forecasting is tested on the example of the UK economy. The results of this prediction are compared with the forecasts obtained by other methods, which have led to the conclusion about the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the method of forecasting at the macro levels of production systems.

It is argued that academic researchers and critics of hip-hop culture are trapped in representations of the fundamental differences between ""mainstream"" and ""underground.""

Existing managing traditions rely largely on indicators borrowed from higher authorities' systems for monitoring and control. It is noteworthy that indicators for assessing effectiveness and quality of teaching are almost not present.

Unfortunately, in most cases to prove the behavioral equivalence is an undecidable problem. A common way to overcome such undecidability is to consider a model of programs with an abstract semantics based on the real one, in which only some simple properties are captured, and to provide an efficient equivalence-checking algorithm for the model. We focus on two kinds of properties of data-modifying statements of imperative programs. Statements a and b are commutative, if the execution of sequences ab and ba lead to the same result. A statement b is (left-)absorptive for a statement a, if the execution of sequences ab and b lead to the same result. We consider propositional program models in which commutativity and absorption properties are caprtured (CA-models). Formally, data states for a CA-model are elements of a monoid over the set of statement symbols, defined by an arbitrary set of relations of the form ab = ba (for commutativity) and ab = b (for absorption). We propose an equivalence-checking algorithm for CA-models based on (what we call) progressive monoids. The algorithm terminates in time polynomial in size of programs. As a consequence, we prove a polynomial-time decidability for the equivalence problem in such CA-models.","commutativity; equivalence checking; left absorption; program models; semigroups","Algebra; Polynomial approximation; Semantics; Absorption property; Behavioral equivalence; Commutativity; Equivalence checking; Equivalence problem; Imperative programs; Program models; Semigroups; Equivalence classes","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84997221485

Entrepreneurial activities have become increasingly important for the introduction and commercialization of new technological solutions. The same is true for Russia’s oil and gas industry, which requires a major technological upscaling to stay competitive. Promising start-ups, however, often face high barriers and fail to commercialize superior technological solutions. The purpose of this study is to show how industry-specific entry barriers can hamper start-up activities. Design/methodology/approach: This paper discusses the experiences of a Russian oilfield service start-up in commercializing a self-developed technology for increasing the productivity of oil wells. Findings: The start-up faced conservatism from corporate decision-makers, declining oil prices and suboptimal protection of intellectual property rights. The company overcame most barriers through moving into other markets outside of Russia, as closing a deal with customers in the USA and Canada went much faster than the extended business cycles of national oil companies. Originality/value: This paper connects sectoral foresight activities to the real-life experience of a start-up.

It is argued that the multiple modernities perspective which emerged as a paradigm of historical sociology is exerting increasing influence on the study of contemporary societies. The multiple modernities approach has been elaborated by S. Eisenstadt. In today's sociology the most influential versions of this perspective are represented by the theories of P. Wagner and J. Arnason. However, the multiple modernities approach remains mostly on the theoretical level. Within this perspective working out of middle-range theories which can be tested empirically is still needed. Some steps in this direction have already been made. Thus the theory of cultural encounters proposed by G. Delanty is discussed in the article. Delanty follows the idea of intercivilizational encounters developed in historical sociology. But he seeks to elaborate that concept and to apply it to cultural encounters in contemporary Europe. Delanty offers a system of ideal types that includes different forms of cultural encounters and considers their possible outcomes. Nevertheless, his approach can be applied mostly to the macro-level of social interaction. In addition, social mechanisms that define the choice of a certain type of interaction of cultures need to be considered in greater detail. At the same time a developing trend of today's sociological theory is connected with searching for the ways to fill in the gap between sociology of culture and new institutionalism. Within this trend N. Fligstein and D. McAdam have worked out a theory of strategic action fields. These scholars are drawing on several theoretical sources including Bourdieu's fields theory. However, further ""humanization"" of the new institutional approach seems relevant. Interaction between new trends in sociology of culture and new versions of institutional sociology can benefit both sides. © 2016r.","Cultural encounters; Multiple modernities; New institutionalism; Social fields",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996488607

At the same time, they were divided on many political issues, as well as by personal attitudes. The rise of the Nazis to power in Germany provoked Maklakov and Gruzenberg, now living in emigration in France, to discuss the new political reality in Europe: that of dictatorships based on massive nationalist mobilization. They discuss the prospects of the Soviet regime in this new reality, which leads them to a bigger question of the “nature” of the Russian people, the historical roots of the Bolshevik Revolution, and their own integrity in politics and as professionals. © 2016, Ab Imperio.

It promoted a version of the deliberately distorted Russian language, first of all by systematically altering orthographic and punctuation norms. This “padonkafskii” language (given the misspelled usage of the original word, it seems more accurate to translate it as “basterds,” as in in Tarantino’s movie) has been analyzed by linguists. Its political role and implicit message have not been scrutinized until now. In the article, Ilya Kukulin argues that this basterd language was used and promoted by pro-Kremlin political entrepreneurs to develop new strategies of communication: performances of cynical transgression and symbolic violence through the humiliation of counterparts. Cyberbullying became a distinctive style of seemingly nonconformist subculture, and already in this capacity was used by the regime. Central to this communication strategy was the cult of power, xenophobia, and discarding of any idealistic motivations of human behavior as hypocritical public relations technologies. At the same time, the basterd subculture itself claimed the status of nonconformist sincerity for its members. This image of a novel subculture helped to promote its aggressive xenophobia and support for the authorities among the most socially dynamic groups of Russia’s population. Political mobilization of the basterds’ language relied on the earlier aesthetic and political strategies of Russian mass culture of the 1990s, which were partially reconfigured or further developed. The radical and socially escapist irony underlying the cultural scene of the 1990s (the article uses Russian punk rock as an example) has been recast into the view of society as a total war, perceived from the position of total cynicism and nihilism. Cynicism has become the main mode of social thinking in modern Russia. Once popular with many bloggers, the basterds’ language is now out of vogue. Moreover, experiments with language transgressions seem to have lost their popularity. Instead, the role of transmitters of an ultra-cynical worldview and proponents of symbolic violence has been assumed by officialdom as represented by press secretaries of the president, key ministries, or MPs. They display the same conscious transgression of linguistic norm and moral standards as their Basterd predecessors, who pretended to be antiestablishment and nonconformist. The preponderance of basterd language during the previous decade cleared the ground for hate-speech and symbolic violence in the public sphere as an acceptable, attractive, and even necessary format of public communication. © 2016, Ab Imperio.

He approaches them as paradigmatic cases of the development of political projects of national autonomy during the first decades of the twentieth century as part and parcel of a more general conceptual transformation. New ways of envisioning the political arrangement in a multicultural society became possible after a methodological shift occurred in the late nineteenth century. Then, philology departed from its classical Humboldtian model with its focus on clear forms and direct genealogies, and modern linguistics emerged heavily borrowing from methodologies of the natural sciences. New philologists began studying the complex sphere of languages and cultures outside the framework of preset hierarchies (e.g., of pure “languages” and inferior “dialects”), which had very important implications for the conceptualization of social diversity. The three protagonists of Dmitriev’s article embodied the three main paradigms of political response to the new epistemological situation. Marr stood for a modernized imperial political entity, Baudouin de Courtenay was a federalist, and Krymskii developed the position that in many ways anticipated the early postcolonial analysis of the 1950s. © 2016, Ab Imperio.

The paper shows the interdependence of accounting practices that ensure transparency in society, with the evolution of visual culture for the last one thousand years. Accounting history for this period is presented as a consequence of the stages which provide the increasing of transparency in economic units (or availability of information) to the actors interested in their activity-from owners to society in general. Visual culture is considered as set of objects suggesting their visual perception, and the technologies supporting them. Synchronism is shown between accounting revolutions and significant changes in visual culture and technologies: these are cultural innovations of the beginning of the 2nd millennium, period of the Renaissance, second half of XIX and end of the XX centuries. Joint periodization is offered for the accounting practices and visual culture, on the basis of changes in the mechanisms of transparency in society, i.e. technologies and instruments of information perception and cultural practices' reproduction. It is shown that visual aspects and innovative technologies supporting them had the greatest impact on development of accounting from all aspects of culture, and this impact can be traced only in the context of the European culture.","Accounting; Accounting history; Cultural history; Culture; Economical history; Transparency; Visual culture; Visual culture history",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995422257

The paper demonstrates that the problem in question, also known as a Hobbesian problem, has been transmitted to the center of the discourse of social science long ago since being formulated for the first time in 1651 by Thomas Hobbes in his famous Leviathan. The solution of the problem of social order as proposed by Hobbes, consisting in the recognition of the necessity to constitute a dominant political authority, i.e., the state which is capable of maintaining stable social relations, caused an intensive theoretical debate that continues to this day. Social theorists have proposed a large variety of answers to the question posed by Hobbes, but none can be considered as final or comprehensive. The paper makes an attempt to reconstruct various theoretical and methodological approaches to the problem of social order, from the solution proposed by Hobbes (including its reformulation by Talcott Parsons) to the analytical concepts of social order elaborated by contemporary thinkers belonging to different theoretical orientations. The article makes the conclusion that translating the old problem of classical political philosophy of modernity into the language of actual contemporary social theory allows the problematization of the heuristic foundations of political discourse of modernity by operationalizing its key concept.","Max weber; Modernity; Regular character of social action; Social integration; social order; Talcott parsons; Theory of society; Thomas hobbes",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994528991

The analysis focuses on the identification of the motifs of the power rhetoric in relation to young people, that is, recurrent speech constructions highlighting a central dimension of the problematized situation and the responses to it. The analysis of the rhetoric confirms the assumption about the pragmatic attitude of the Russian ruling elite concerning youth. Authorities problematize an alleged external influence on young people, while a number of situations that could be defined as a problem such as the limited life chances of young people, HIV/AIDS, or repressive criminal policy, etc., do not have the status of the problem. The study of speeches of the president, government programs, and Russian government reports shows that the specific motifs of the authorities' rhetoric in relation to youth are ""threat,"" ""protection,"" and ""traditional values"" while the permanent features of the power discourse are militarization and traditionalism. The authorities emphasize ""traditional values"" without specifying what these values are. These values are declared as ""true"" and opposed to ""quasi-values,"" without clarifying the principles of such division.

This branch of narrative theory considers, among others, the issues of emergence, development and refunctionalization of certain narrative categories and techniques over time. From discourse linguistics the author adapts the term ""mode"" to describe the differences between presenting the story in a novel in the form of a written document or an oral account - a feature which is sadly neglected by scholars of literature. The article is an attempt to trace various modifications of oral and written modes in the British novel across the period of late 17th - 19th centuries. The limitations for the research are the following: the novels are written in the first person, this person is a diegetic narrator, and there is a pronounced retrospective component in the novel. The two modes are seen as poles of a continuum within which it is still possible to differentiate between four types of modal relations: the predominance of the oral mode, the predominance of the written mode, the neutralized mode, and the dual mode. The predominance of the oral mode in a novel is comparatively rare and usually accompanies exotic, adventurous or fantastic storylines (Behn, Reid, Wells). It functions as a medium connecting the reader to the fictional world by modeling aural communication that ""dissolves"" the physical written text. On the contrary, the written mode materializes the fictional world into the text of the book. This allows the reader to perceive the story as a part of his primary reality. Early English novel almost exclusively resorts to the written mode by imitating the forms of memoirs, diaries and letters (Defoe, Swift, Richardson and others). There are some examples of the neutralization of modes in the Victorian age (Charlotte and Ann Bronte, Dickens), i.e. the reader cannot form a stable opinion of whether the story is fixed in any document or is narrated orally. The author attributes this to the Realist strategy. The dual mode, when the features of both modes are combined in the same novel, can be traced across the studied period (Sterne, Mary Shelley, Emily Bronte). It seems to be a productive technique for the evolvement of the novel as a genre. At the same time its analysis helps to highlight both the writer's artistic idiosyncrasies and the period's tendencies. The author concludes with the hypothesis of the emergence of another, mental, mode which reflects the processes of memory and remembrance as they appear in the narrator consciousness. It buds already in David Copperfield and blossoms in the 20th-century novel. Tuning the suggested typology by taking into account all three modes and the novels beyond the 19th century is the prospect of the research.","Charles Dickens; English novel; Historical narratology; Laurence Sterne; Mary Shelley; Oral; The Bronte sisters; Written and mental modes",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994516334

We describe the development of video analysis and the areas where this methodology is applied. The article analyses the characteristics of video as a research tool for studying everyday interactions, and emphasizes the advantages of the method such as the naturalistic approach, a focus on the multimodality and organization of interactions, and the ability to grasp the role of material objects and environment. We outline specific traits of video, such as the possibility of replaying it, the similarities and differences of the social, scientific and ""professional"" methods of working with video, and the reflexivity in the process of production and handling recordings. Using video for sociological research is discussed as a space of methodological choices. Issues of where to install a camera, what software to employ for archiving files, montage and editing, how to transcribe and present data, or whether to analyze fragments on data sessions have substantive consequences. These choices are made by the researcher and formed by his interests and questions, as well as by particularities of the object. The aspects and potential of video analysis are elaborated in the example of the research of museum visitors. Besides a brief review of the recent studies of visitors' interactions, we demonstrate how a sociologist can produce, transcribe, and make sense of a video fragment.","Audiovisual data; Ethnomethodology; Interaction; Multimodality; Video analysis; Videography",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994493210

Youth sociolect is a constantly evolving part of the language. It is the most flexible layer of the language in which a constant process of updating the vocabulary structure is going on, as a result of which there appear not only new slang words and expressions but also there emerge new previously unknown thematic areas. The objective reason for these changes is that certain notions go out of use and new concepts that are to be named come up. The subjective reason lies in the activity and creativity of slang speakers who think of new words and expressions and constantly invest them with a different meaning later on. The research also explores in moving fashion changes in the gender aspect of the youth sociolect. In the 18th and 19th centuries slang was predominantly young men's domain since women were not allowed to universities. In the 20th century women got access to higher education but the situation hardly changed and slang words continued to be concerned with male preoccupations. In the 21st century gender asymmetry starts to decrease gradually with slang used equally by both men and women. Lexical-semantic development is most visible in the change of meanings of slang words that lose their old meanings and repeatedly acquire new ones, in which connection this process can be repeated again and again. The changes in semantics take place at irregular intervals. Sometimes terms get backtheir old meanings one or two centuries later. This is mostly the case with polysemantic slang words that change only some of their meanings rather than all of them. The process of creation of new slangy names for designation of the same persons, objects, concepts is also very active thanks to which there appear synonymic groups whose length indicates the importance of these realities for youth slang speakers. Due to the transparency of the borders of the youth language we observe transition of separate lexical units into the colloquial and even standard language as is evidenced by the development of some student terms and expressions which are traced in the article three centuries back. The research is a case study of the material of the most significant dictionaries of the 18th-21st centuries. All the findings are illustrated by concrete examples from these lexicographic sources.","German; Language; Semantics; Sociolect; Vocabulary; Youth",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992731097

The article examines the reporting of Russian business organizations with reference to the state bodies. The article includes the following topics: The notion of reporting, types and features of reporting, problems of reporting, the procedure for the establishing of new types of reporting for business organizations. The article examines the reporting regardless of the scope of regulation. Other articles usually consider reporting of enterprises only in relation to the financial sector (tax reporting) or to the statistical reporting, but this article studies reporting at the universal level. The author distinguishes the following types of reporting: The state statistical reporting, financial reporting (accounting and tax reporting), reporting of sectors. There is a description of each type of reporting and its legal regulation, of signs and features of each type of reporting systems in the article. The article presents a classification of the business reporting on various grounds. It is proved that the reporting is a tool of state regulation and enforcement on a par with such tools as: various state permissions (licensing, accreditation, certification, etc.), control functions of state bodies (testing and inspection business). Reporting creates costs for business as it needs completing reporting forms. Therefore, this article proposes to introduce regulatory mechanisms that exclude the establishment of redundant reporting forms. The authors' conclusions were verified in eight areas of public administration. The authors revealed an exhaustive list of reporting forms in all these areas. Such forms were reviewed with regard to the content and purposes of their collection.

It offers alternative defi nitions of government regulation as an independent branch of economic policy that has been attracting ever more attention in recent years. The article analyses approaches to the optimization of government regulation taking into account market failures and market improvement opportunities, and makes a point that contradistinguishing government regulation from market regulation is unjustifi ed. An observation is made that since regulation implies a certain degree of enforcement, the eff ectiveness of regulation largely depends on the amount of trust that society places in the government. It is common knowledge that government regulation is examined, in both theory and practice, through the prism of not only public but also private interests. To secure advantages and benefits, certain interest groups attempt to influence the formation of government regulators, oft en to the detriment of public interests. Th is raises the question about the aspects of reasonable deregulation. When it comes to choosing the practical course for improvement of government regulation, the recommendations of the OECD Regulatory Policy Committee (RPC), based on many years of analysis of regulatory performance in many countries, are invaluable. Analysis of the evolution of Russian regulatory practices demonstrates that they are generally consistent with OECD recommendations. Superfl uous regulatory functions of the government (unrelated to market failures) are scaled back, resulting in a reduction of administrative barriers and translating into business climate improvements. Market entry formalities are simplified along with control and oversight procedures applicable to business entities. Information transparency increases as regulatory requirements become more readily available and self-regulation improves. And yet further steps aimed at improvement of government regulation call for a deeper and more profound analysis and fundamental preparations in terms of creating information databases for a risk-oriented approach and making regulators really independent and more accountable.","Accreditation; Certification; Licensing; Regulatory action; Selfregulation; State regulation",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992561250

Hazel Markus, the author of the term ""possible self"", adds a new component to the general model ofself-concept for an explanation of how concepts of potency influence self-concept as a whole. Possible self is the part of self-concept that appeals to the sphere of future and potency, and serves as a cognitive expression of expectations, goals, fears, hopes and aspirations of the subject, as well as the link between cognitive appraisal of self and motivation. The current estimation of the self, as H. Markus believes, considers possible selves, those that the person would like to become, selves that he avoids, and even selves that will never become real. At the same time this mechanism is not reduced only to understanding of the goal or appraisal of the possible future, but surely includes experience of a potential situation from within and appraisal of opportunities to act. In such form it becomes the important instrument of the personality development and personality resource of self-regulation and coping with difficulties. The role and the place of this approach in the general theory of self-concept were analyzed. The concepts ""self-schema"" and ""working self-concept"" were defined. Some opportunities of application of this approach in psychotherapy are revealed. Results of some empirical studies provided within this approach are given. It is shown that possible self construct demonstrates high heuristic potential and demonstrates ample opportunities of application in psychological practice.","Personality resources; Possible self; Self-concept; Self-determination",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992513902

Recent studies showed that basic human values could be used to explain considerable proportion of variance in attitudes towards immigrants and immigration. These studies reported that across cultural contexts the value dimension of self-transcendence is positively related to attitudes to migrants, and the value dimension of conservation is related negatively. In this paper I attempt to address some theoretical problems with universalistic interpretations of value-behavior relationships and propose a new method to identify culturally specific patterns of value-attitude relationships. Data from 25 countries collected in waves 5 and 6 of the European Social Survey (ESS) was used to assess feasibility of the proposed method. Accounting for cross-country variation significantly improved predictions of attitudes towards immigrants from individual values. Moreover, the proposed measure moderated the relationship between individual values and attitudes towards immigrants when tested against an independent data set.

Travel transforms the ontological meaning of concepts of space and movement contributing to the evolution of mixed, hybrid, synthetic concepts describing and characterizing the dynamic geo-imaginative pictures of the world. Travel viewed through the prism of postnomadism may be understood as an existential co-spatiality experience. Postnomadism is an aspiration to imagine and comprehend a journey as a complete spatiality existence ontologically understood as co spatiality.

The Russian movement is far from homogenous and varies by many parameters, e.g. ideology, governance, lifestyle. Ecovillage communities and settlements began to form as ? way of isolating their inhabitants in one way or another from modern society. The process accelerated in the 2000s spurred by the publication of Vladimir Megre's book Anastasia (1996), the first book in the Ringing Cedars of Russia series (of which ten volumes have been published so far with more than 11 million copies sold). 'Anastasian' settlements, the so-called kin's domain settlements (consisting of family-owned homesteads), rapidly became the prevailing type of ecovillages in Russia. However, until recently this phenomenon has remained relatively underresearched, and this article attempts to fill in this gap by exploring these communities in the context of Russia's ecovillage movement. The work is based on field research carried out by the author in 2012-2015 in nine ecovillages located in Western Russia and the Urals. It is based on 32 in-depth interviews with 54 respondents and overt observations. Additional interviews were conducted with the inhabitants of neighbouring non-ecovillage communities, and people possessing expert knowledge on the subject in question (V. Hiltunen, expert on ecovillages, and the functionaries of the municipalities where the surveyed communities are located). The author reveals the social structure of ecovillage communities, their subsistence models, sources of income, self-organization and governance, as well as relations with local and government authorities, and the inhabitants of neighboring villages. Fundamental differences between ecovillage communities and traditional rural communities are identified with regard to the origin of the inhabitants, their education, demographic characteristics, subsitence and farming practices.","Anastasians; Deurbanization; Ecovillages; Kin's domain settlements; Self-isolation; Social structure of rural communities",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991207377

The article draws the substance of political symbolization from the theory of the symbol, introduced by German Romantics. Political symbolization is conceptualized in terms of the multiplicity of unstated meanings in communication within a political context. The findings of the article have a significant implication in that political symbolization is a unpredictable phenomenon; it becomes ""visible"" as if it has been happening in reality. However, in the collective perception due to the dispositions of interpreters, political symbolization is presented as more essential than the viscera of life. The author shows how the mechanism of persuasion may become an independent, productive source in the sphere of politics. Thus, the mechanism of persuasion cannot be simplified to the translation of the ideas, but it is also capable of producing new meanings. In this framework, political argumentation can be used not only for promoting ideas in the sphere of politics, but might produce politics itself. Arguments that might be marked as ""true"" or ""false"" are transformed into judgments of the ideologically normative language. Therefore, the ability ""to impose"" one's ideological perspective on the public gains crucial importance as it consists of axiological and cognitive elements. Resources taken from argumentation mechanisms maintain a real political force in the process of agenda-setting. However, not any rhetorical message appealing to a specific political community will lead to the steady and efficient process of collective self-identification, which is always followed by the production of new political meanings through collective judgments.","German Romanticism; Mechanisms of persuasion; Political argumentation; Political symbolization; Rhetoric; Symbol",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990861939

However, since the early 1960s, Goffman has distanced himself from the dramaturgical approach, and searched for a new source for theorizing. For Goffman, games became one of such sources. Despite the wide arsenal of analytical concepts and research experience formed during this period, Goffman is not perceived as a game theoretician, and his approach to the study of everyday life through the gaming metaphor has not found popularity among researchers of gamification practices. The article aims to reveal the theoretical potential of Erving Goffman's gaming encounter by briefly marking the main collisions of his approach with adjacent areas, although mostly with symbolic interactionism and ethnomethodology. We conclude that, unlike symbolic interactionism, the gaming concept tends to limit the extent of penetration of the symbolic content of interactions; a sequence of moves and results of an encounter only makes sense because of the recursive interpretation of the participants. In contrast, Goffman points out that the outcome of the gaming encounter depends on the previous sequence of moves and the situationally-available set of events. Ethnomethodologists note that everyday life is not interrupted during breaks and is not played by the rules, like games. According to Goffman, the gaming interaction eventually has an interrupted temporality, which, however, does not imply strategic timeouts. In turn, the existing gap with game theory is explained by the fact that Goffman deliberately excludes the strict calculation of everyday life interactions, leaving a significant role for the indeterminate. Despite the fact that Goffman's concept is both close to one and then to another approach for the same reasons and causes many authors to try to find the similarities between them, it retains the original analytical advantages.","Dramaturgical approach; Ethnomethodology; Euphoria function; Gaming encounter; Gaming metaphor; Spontaneous involvement; Symbolic interactionism",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990845563

Arendt's and P. Ricoeur's different philosophical interests. Both thinkers analyze this phenomenon in the context of the Avraama-Christian tradition of forgiveness, and ask the question concerning the opportunity of forgiveness in common life. This article gives the reasons for Ricoeur's references to Arendt's concept of forgiveness. It puts forward the idea that the rethinking of natality is a basis of Ricoeur's concept of ""forgiveness for us"". This article describes both the continuity and disagreement in Ricoeur's and Arendt's approaches to the issue of forgiveness. If Arendt conceptualizes forgiveness in terms of act, Ricoeur examines this phenomenon from the perspective of selfhood. For Arendt, forgiveness is not a typical action, but an event breaking the causal structure of common being. For her, forgiveness is some exception from the public space necessary for its own existence. Ricoeur proposes to consider forgiveness as a constant of common being. He analyzes forgiveness as a difficult act, but always possible ""incognito"". Despite these differences, Arendt's notion of natality becomes the decisive category for Ricoeur in justifying the constant of forgiveness. In introducing the condition of the separation between agent and act, he recognizes natality as a cause of the possible update of a guilty selfhood. This article assumes that Ricoeur's appeal to Arendt helps him to formulate his own concept of forgiveness based on the review of the principles of the Avraamic tradition and its reception in Derrida's philosophy. Thanks to Arendt, the place of forgiveness in Ricoeur's theory as an ""experience of the impossible"" takes the difficult, but always possible, ""incognito"" forgiveness.","Action; Arendt; Forgetting; Forgiveness; Memory; Natality; Plurality; Ricoeur",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990828256

According to Igor Kopytoff, violation of the border between commodities and unique objects leads to the undermining of social order [Kopytoff 2006]. Nevertheless, the existence of commercial surrogacy does not bring disorder, and therefore, the question is: how can this commercial service be functional and legitimate in society? The study is based on the analysis of 14 interviews with staff members of Moscow reproduction clinics and agencies providing the legal support services for surrogate mothers. The authors show that identification of the child's status, selection of potential parents and surrogate mothers, as well as the regulation of relations between them by staff members, are formed in a way to fit the notion of kinship in accordance with the Euro-American theory of David Schneider [Schneider 1980]. The theory has at its core the idea that kinship relations are primarily determined by common genetic substance and secondarily by social relationships based on specific behavior patterns in the family. This leads to the priority of genetic kin in the creation of kinship ties perception and the decreasing significance of the gestational relationship. Thus, staff members' recognition of the genetic ties as dominating above all allows for legitimation of commercial surrogacy as a whole and in its organizational aspects through decommodification of the child, who is no longer considered an object of market transaction.","Assisted reproductive technologies; Commodification; Euro-American theory of kinship; Justification logics; Kinship; Legitimation; Surrogate motherhood",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989180870

Interactionist and constructionist studies of social problems demonstrate that the leaders and press-services of law enforcement organizations usually engage in a subtle rhetorical game, highlighting both the gravity of ""their"" problem, and, simultaneously, the success of their actions. This research considers the question of how the FDCS takes on the challenge of this ""double task"", which it does through various rhetorical devices. Also under consideration is how the service combines a demonstration of the grave seriousness, with reminders of their efficacy as an agency. This study analyzed over 70 speeches delivered by head of the FDCS, Viktor Ivanov, from January, 2013 till December, 2014. The use of a strict constructionist approach from the school of Peter Ibarra and John Kitsuse revealed the key features of agency? rhetoric: including metaphorical parallels with natural disasters, playing around with big numbers and presenting drugs as a ""mega-problem"" breeding crime, terrorism, extremism and piracy. These features correspond to the rhetoric of calamity. FDCS has created a special vocabulary which underlines the catastrophic character of the problem. Phrases such as ""narco-tsunami"", ""narco volcano"", ""heroin volcano"", ""number one threat for Russia"" and ""a giant army of drug users"" give an indication of the style employed. However, the necessity to demonstrate the efficacy of the federal service demands the transformation of this rhetorical idiom into the one of ""controlled calamity"" which presents the situation as catastrophic but at the same time successfully kept under control. This rhetoric constitutes the basis for the demands to increase financing and authority of the FDCS, encouraging an expansion of their funding and influence into areas such as drugs rehabilitation programmes.","Claims-making; Constructionism; Drug use; Rhetoric; Social problems; Vernacular resources",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988643580

During this period, the Internet became an issue for Russian public policy. Russia implements public programs providing Internet-access to the citizens, and simultaneously limits the Internet through restrictions and censorship. We propose that official discourse reflects public policy, and transforms official representations of the Internet accordingly. By uncovering the role and representations of the Internet in official discourse, we explain national social policies aimed at providing Internet to the citizens. To reveal official representation of the Internet in Russia, we, primarily, reconstruct the sequence of state decisions: this includes the federal laws, state programs on Internet proliferation, presidential addresses (poslaniya), domestic and international public events and commitments that have shaped the development of the Internet in Russia. Three Russian presidents contributed to developing the Internet in different ways. This diversity can be traced in the transformation of the official discourse. To measure and visualize these changes content analysis was conducted of all the relevant official documents, including presidential addresses (poslaniya), national strategies, doctrines and conceptions. We pay attention to the strategic documents, which partly refer to the Internet or other Internet-related concepts. These concepts included Internet security, the information society, e-government, cyber-security and national security. The study reveals three periods in the official discourse. Between 1994 and 1999, during Yeltsin? presidency, the Internet was weakly presented in the official discourse, and the state was the key actor in Internet proliferation. In the period from 2000 to 2011 the state continued to play a strong role in the proliferation of the Internet, and the Internet was portrayed as a ""benefit"" in official texts claiming that it AIDS pubic development. In the third period from 2012 to 2014, the third presidency term of Putin, the Internet was represented as a ""threat"" to society, state and security. The discourse of threats extended to accounting dangers for the Internet itself as an issue of social policy. This periodization in the official discourse corresponds with changes in Russian social policy and state decisions regarding Internet in Russia.","Content-analysis; Good; Internet; Official discourse; Representation; Russia; Threat",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988643227

For corruption to prosper it must possess an efficient and resilient social organization. Given the understudied nature of organized police corruption and its detrimental consequences for socioeconomic development and (inter)national security, this study seeks to understand how corruption functions as a social system in different institutional regimes. To do this, we draw upon organised crime, covert networks, secret societies, and organisational theories, using a mixed-method approach that combines comparative case study and qualitative social network analysis to reconstruct the actual operational schemes of two ongoing corrupt police networks in Bulgaria and Russia. This analysis reveals that in spite of corruption's diverse manifestations in a variety of institutional regimes, organisations and societies, it exhibits a common network configuration. Shadow police alliances typically have a core led by a high-ranking official who, assisted by 'money movers,' takes key economic and political decisions. The core develops a buffer zone to protect itself from investigation. Lowranking officers tend to undertake high-profile activity while the core members tend to keep such activities at an arm's length from themselves to ensure deniability of any corrupt practices. Finally, there is a periphery composed of an officer clientele that finances, warns and protects the network from internal or external threats. Networked police corruption is predominantly oriented towards moneymaking, resembling an intelligent enterprise more closely than terrorist or anarchic criminal groups. It has regular customers, owners and workers. There is evidence of labour division, hierarchy and defined responsibilities. The production process of corruption is carefully conceptualised with the client and is organised and operationalised in an elegant assembly line, in which every member adds new value to the final product. This is incentivised by a sense of property rights enforced by the secret code. Nevertheless, organised police corruption is far from being efficient or similar to the democratic practices of a state institution. Just like an organised criminal group, it fabricates threats and self-perpetuates on the very insecurity it injects in the market. It produces discrimination on the market and is unfair towards those policemen who do not engage in corruption.","Bulgaria; Comparative case study; Corruption; Covert networks; Police; Qualitative social network analysis; Russia",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988632716

This city entered the repertoire of Russian protest movement in winter 2011-2012. These flash mobs involved toys, which gathered considerable media attention, are examined as manifestations of the mediatisation of civil protests. Which theories can be used to make sense of such mediatised, spectacular forms of protest? And what does each approach contribute to our understanding and explanation of these phenomena? The article shows how nano-demonstrations can be interpreted as a ""media-event"", a ""cultural performance"", and a ""network"", as well as examining the interplay between these approaches. In particular, ""toy riots"" are conceptualised as imitation media-events; social performances, repeatedly reproduced both in the real urban space and the virtual space of media communications. Nano-demonstrations were able to go viral thanks to global media-networks, especially the Russian online service VKontakte, which was used by ""Barnaul civic movement"" activists to announce and coordinate protest actions. The toy protest, as well as the movement ""For fair elections"" on the whole, was a networked event not only in this technological sense, but in terms of its lack of centralisation: protest networks are rhizomatic, just like the virtual space of the Internet. Besides, the toys, which symbolically represented the ""dissenters"", played the role of Latour? ""actants"", facilitating the opportunity to register protest and provoking a media response. Being ""non-human"", they became central to the performance named ""nano-demonstration"" and initiated actions among many other actants, including the global media. This article pays special attention to interdisciplinary theories that have developed at the intersection of media studies and social movement studies. These approaches analyse civic protests in terms of the communication repertoires employed by the protesters. Contemporary social movement activists have to be ""advanced"" users of media technology, since the success of their protest actions is connected to how visible they become, both for the authorities and other members of the society. In this case, media is not just a means to construct social issues and include them into the public agenda; it is also about the production of citizenship, communities and collective actions and broadening opportunities for participation in the political process for various social actors. This, the author concludes, is a manifestation of the fundamental process of society mediatisation.","Media; Media event; Mediatisation of civil resistance; Networks; Protest movements; Toy protest",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988583442

The study demonstrates the existence of problems in how the concept of digital literacy is transforming. This is caused by sociocultural changes, which are based on scientific and technological progress, and the emergence of a large number of ""partial literacies"" that are closely related to each other. The ideas of Albert Boekhorst are further developed, with paticular attention to notions related to the digital literacy concept (computer literacy, Internet literacy, media and information literacy, etc.). The author presents a new theoretical model named ""The Digital Literacy Four-Component Model"" that constitutes a synthesis of current approaches to the understanding of digital literacy within the conditional semantic space of two constructs: firstly, the ""technical and socio-humanitarian"" and, secondly, ""opportunities and threats"". Four components of the field of theoretical approaches and practices relating to digital literacy are located in these two semantic constructs. The first one is ""Technical and pragmatic opportunities"", which is a utilitarian, pragmatic tool empowering human development in the digital environment. The second is a ""Meaningful and communicative opportunities"", and considers mediatised communication, advanced features for creating and receiving media texts from other participants of communication processes, their perception and interpretation. The third component is ""Technical and technological threats"" it emphasises safety devices used and software. The final component is ""Sociopsychological threats"".and examines the social, psychological and ethical aspects of work in the digital environment that creates danger, including Internet addiction and cyberbullying.

Based on the data collected during the study of the implementation of electronic health records in medical practices, the article shows that the widespread view of habitual action as an action in accordance with a preliminary scheme does not describe the actual structure of healthcare activities, a view that forms a basis for the majority of medical information systems. The analysis of how doctors perceive and use electronic health records in their daily practice shows that a situational approach to routine actions is more adequate. For example, the use of so-called ""templates"" that are created by doctors within the electronic health records system demonstrates the importance of a situational context of professional activities. Doctors, creating and using various ""templates,"" do this in such ways that allows them to make these health records circumstantially understandable. This work of producing a situational recognizability that does not consist in the use of pre-established schemes can and should be the subject of sociological analysis. The understanding of routine activities as situationally-oriented, concerted achievements not only proves the possibility of a new approach to the description of the habitual actions' role and place in the structure of social action, but can be important for the design and evaluation of professional information systems. © Andrei Korbut, 2016.","Electronic health records; Ethnomethodology; Habits; Routine medical practice; Situated action; Templates",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988529601

This article examines how ethnicity has influenced the formation of adaptation strategies in the specific case of North Caucasus migrant experience in Moscow. Studying migrant attitudes can help improve the effectiveness of various adaptation programs, which are of benefit to both the host population and the migrants of Moscow's multicultural metropolis. The following research questions are considered: What coping strategies are used by migrants from the North Caucasus? What is the role of ethnicity in shaping and implementing these strategies? Activating the resources of ethno-cultural networks can be a great source of hope to migrants seeking social protection and economic empowerment, but at the same time it can be source of stigma in the discourse of the dominant group. Stigmatizing discourses are reproduced by the minorities and become a powerful tool that reinforces and perpetuates ethnic boundaries, restricting access to various resources. Reliance on ethno-cultural communication is only one of the strategies employed. Others exist that can be based on ignoring ethnicity or minimizing its importance. The coping strategies that emphasise ethnicity can be implemented in a variety of ways. We outlined three such versions after analysing the comments made by participants in our focus groups. Two of them, which we term 'compensatory' and 'accusatory,' essentially serve the function of psychological protection as they focus on the in-group's merits, while underlining the failings of the out-groups. The third version is aimed at providing of support to the members of one's group. The implementation of strategies that minimizes the importance of ethnicity begins with acquiring negative beliefs about one's in-group and distancing oneself from the co-ethnics group. The second step involves searching for explanations for the shortcomings of one's co-ethnic group, which is achieved by referring to non-ethnic factors perceived as objective social factors. In other cases these issues can be sidestepped by resorting to individual resources in social adaptation and rejecting the use of group categories.","Coping Strategies; Discrimination; Migration; Stigma",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988458196

The aim of the research is to determine the main factors that influenced the level of public satisfaction with public services. The research is based on the hypothesis that perception of the quality of public l services depends not only on their content and administrative provision, but also on the factors, which characterize civil servants' performance as well as specific features of the territorial bodies of the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation. The following factors are considered: satisfaction with the waiting time in queues, satisfaction with politeness and competence of civil servants, the number of employees of the territorial bodies of FMS, the income level of citizens in regions, the level of migration in regions and some other factors. To determine the significance of these factors the factor analysis method is used. The data are received from the federal information system «Vash kontrol'» and the Federal Statistics Service of the Russian Federation as they were in 2014. As a result of the factor analysis the most and the least satisfied recipients of public services are classified on the regional basis. The study highlights a great influence of the migration factor - the higher the level of migration in the region, the lower the citizens' satisfaction with public services. The results of the study can serve as a basis for further research on the best regional practices of public services provision. Furthermore, they can help identify the regions in need of a more careful monitoring of public services provision.","Citizen satisfaction; Civil servants; Factor analysis; Performance evaluation; Performance indicators; Public assessment; Public services; Public services' quality evaluation",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987763917

This reform has radically changed the system of minimum wages by increasing the role of collective bargaining at the regional level. The existing legislation gives the regions substantial freedom to decide on the form of tripartite agreement, the size of RMW and the inclusion of different groups of employees. The reform gave rise to a plenty of institutional experiments at the regional level. Over the last eight years, more than 4/5 of the Russian regions got experience with the RMW. In this paper, we study the evolution of this labor market institution in 2007-2015 focusing on the regional variation of minimum wage policies. We demonstrate that the most important differences between regions are related to the following features: setting the uniform RMW or different RMWs for the budgetary and non-budgetary sectors; setting the RMW via general tripartite agreement or via special agreement on the RMW; agreeing the RMW with the regional subsistence level.","Collective bargaining; Labor market institutions; Minimum wage; Regional variation",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987749781

Agent's voting power is treated as the capability to influence the result of collective decision-making process. Often the voting power is not equal to votes share the agent possess. We obtain the values of classical and modified power indices for European political groups and compare their performance. The Banzhaf power index is employed to measure European political groups' a priori power that does not impose any restrictions on coalition formation, and power indices that take into account groups' preferences in coalition formation in order to measure actual voting power. Classical power indices are calculated using only votes' distribution in the committee and a quota to pass a decision. Pairwise preferences allow to have respect to different willingness of groups to form a single coalition. In this paper preferences are modeled using the roll-call data from the votings on important issues of European politics. The less popular is the MP's position, the smaller is the number of coalitions she can enter and the less is the voting power. We demonstrate that factions can exploit their position and acquire higher relative power than both share of seats and the Banzhaf index measures, and the Liberal group of the European Parliament forming coalitions with both partners from the left and the right is the case. Conversely, hard restrictions on formation of coalitions due to ideological differences can lead to less actual voting power than a priori.","European Parliament; European political groups; Power distribution; Power indices; Preferences in coalition formation; Voting power; Voting with quota",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986587084

In European countries, pathways to family ceased being stable several decades ago, while in Russia - as in any post-socialist country - such features of life course deinstitutionalization as postponement of marriage, rising cohabitation, and reordering of events were revealed only in the 1990s and explained from the perspective of the Second Demographic Transition (SDT). Our aim is to demonstrate how family formation trajectories of men and women from different generations were transforming with the incorporation of data mining. The three-wave panel data of the Russian part of the ""Generations and Gender Survey"" (2004, 2007, 2011; N=5321) and the retrospective data of the survey ""Person, Family, Society"" (2013; N=4477) are used for achieving this aim. Sequence Analysis shows that generations born after 1970 started to exhibit de-standardized family formation trajectories. As the proportion of Russians who raise children in cohabitation or while single rises, such models of behavior become more widely accepted and practiced in contemporary Russia. Women experience more events in the family trajectory, take steps toward family formation earlier, and stay alone with children more often than men. Matrimonial and reproductive behavior has become diverse, proving that Russia fully exhibits the SDT.","Family Formation Trajectories; Matrimonial And Reproductive Behavior; Sequence Analysis","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Learning systems; Metadata; Surveys; Demographic transition; European Countries; Life course; Matrimonial And Reproductive Behavior; Panel data; Russian federation; Sequence analysis; Trajectories","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984796513

The study covers eight strategic documents of patriotic education of the United States, Singapore, China and Russia. Key findings from the study are: (1) The abrupt nature of the Russian patriotism shows that external events play a major role in its formation rather than public policy. Consolidation of the Russian society is not realized through cultivating of positive patriotic values, but on the basis of negative factors. Their influence can only lead to a blind, but not to the constructive patriotism. (2) Russian program documents emphasize militarist bias of patriotic education, and this is evidently blurring legal and theoretical basis of patriotism formation in Russia. Patriotic education cannot exist for its own sake. Also, it can only develop emotional components of state identity. This prevents formation of constructive patriotism and cultivates such qualities as unconditional love for the homeland, convinced devotion to public authorities, unquestioning positive evaluation of government structures, rejection of critical evaluation, readiness to defend the state up to the sacrifice. (3) There is a need to harmonize the ""official"" definition of patriotism with the concepts of civic education and nation-building. Patriotism can be regarded as love for a country, devotion to the state expressed in knowledge of historical and contemporary achievements of the country, free support of spiritual and moral values, manifestation of citizenship based on the active participation in civil society, constructive criticism of the government and expression of one's point of views. Such definition of patriotism integrates emotional relationship of the citizen to the country, state, civil and national identity. It emphasizes importance of the traditions and values, and creates a construct of active and free social behavior without infringing alternative values, traditions and attitudes existant in the world. © 2016 r.","Atlas.ti; CIVIC education; Government program; Nation-building; Patriotic education; Patriotism; Public policy",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984653666

Author emphasizes challenging issues and ambiguities of this approach. A rationalist approach to corruption, including economic approach, does not address value judgments or norms and standards, but describes in terms of functional assessment its symptoms and consequences. The paper counters the claim that corruption fulfils positive functions such as deregulation and overcoming bureaucratic barriers. The paper reveals a generalized mechanism of corruption: exceeding authority and violating official powers and duties regulations, including code of conduct and ethical standards, and (or) social behavioral, moral, and ethical norms, an official or an administrative organization illegitimately distributes and uses resources of the organization to gain personal or group benefits, not to implement the functions and objectives of the organization.

The author also refers to the concepts of Mikhail Bakhtin's chronotope and polyphony and to the concept of intertextuality, referring to the influence of German romantic poets on Boris Pasternak's work. The poem ""Hamlet"" was written by Boris Pasternak in 1946 and is part of a cycle of Yuri Zhivago's poems from the novel Doctor Zhivago, being one of the central texts not only in this cycle but also in the whole work of the poet. The idea to read a poem ""armed with"" categories of the philosophy of German romanticism is not accidental. It is known that Pasternak felt a strong influence of German-speaking culture; his translations of poems by Rilke, drafts of his own works are evidence of this fact. In his published works, we can also see quotes and reminiscences of N. Lenau, H. Heine, E. T. A. Hoffmann; Goethe plays a very important role in his work. Such an analysis of the poem, relying on some of the key concepts of the philosophy and motives of German romanticism, allows seeing some interesting aspects. First, it helps to explore the intertextual richness of the text, not only on the syntagmatic level, the level of citations, but also on the paradigmatic level, the level of the author's reflections on various topics, a range of issues, his attitude to the culture and the determination of his own place in the world of this culture. Secondly, the text of the poem shows again the importance of the German romantic philosophy for Pasternak's work. The theatrical metaphor, the metonymical intertextual elements, an unusual organization of the time-spatial structure of the text, the overcoming of all boundaries within the narrator and the overcoming of borders in the universe as a result, experienced in a certain moment, show the author's attitude to the historical time, which brings us back again to the context of German romanticism, because time is one of the key issues that interested scientists and artists of the epoch. The most important thing is that despite the complexity and multi-layered content of the poem, it is incredibly simple in its structure; it is a clear text architectural model of the universe in which different cultural codes harmoniously coexist, the model of the poetic universe of Boris Pasternak.","Chronotope; Intertextuality; Macrocosm and microcosm; Metaphor; Philosophy of German romanticism; Theatre",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983455111

Philosophical and historical concepts are central to both books, both examine the ways of getting knowledge but are very different in scale. English literature of the end of the 20th century represents rationality crisis caused by social cataclysms, wars and destruction of the 20th century. Chaos and unstable reality, unapprehensiveness of the world, narratives about this world's history are topics typical of Graham Swift's writing. Shift of ideological paradigms caused by changes in social systems and destruction of explanatory schemes brought discredit to historical narratives of the end of the millenium. Literature of the end of the 20th century in general pays special attention to these topics, but for Graham Swift's writing they are most significant. Epistemological crisis of contemporary history resulted in distrust in traditional historiography and traditional historical sources; it gave rise to a very special type of literary writing, represented by novels of A. Carter, J. Barnes, P. Ackroyd, A. Byatt, etc. They wrote about living in crisis, history, both public and private, and explored existential questions in their novels. Personal history was mythologized in the 20th century; private history is at the forefront of writers' interest: they shifted from epic social pictures to the existential framework of living. Graham Swift is known to be obsessive about exploring history and ways people get knowledge. Historical process in Graham Swift's novels is always nonlinear; it is not determined by direct cause-effect relation. History in his writing is not characterized by a gradual advance; progress as a form of social development is typically negated. ""Knowing"" as a problem of learning the past on both philosophical and common sense levels is central to all Swift's novels but is of particular interest in Waterland and Last Orders. It is the way Swift interprets learning the past that distinguishes Waterland and Last Orders. Waterland represents a metaphysical picture of the world history, regional and natural history and family life of several generations, while the space of Last Orders is narrowed to a funeral day of one of the characters giving a fine example of ""everyday life"" philosophy. It is supposed that Graham Swift's novels epitomize a postmodern view on the historical process: he is critical to the very idea of having reliable knowledge about the past; he rethinks the idea that history might ""be learnt"" at all, his characters distrust the knowledge they get.","Epistemological crisis; Graham swift; Last Orders; Waterland",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983448950

However, applying ensembles of trees deteriorates interpretability of the final model. Another problem is that decision tree learning can be seen as a greedy search for a good classification hypothesis in terms of some information-based criterion such as Gini impurity or information gain. But in case of small data sets the global search might be possible. In this paper, we propose an FCA-based lazy classification technique where each test instance is classified with a set of the best (in terms of some information-based criterion) rules. In a set of benchmarking experiments, the proposed strategy is compared with decision tree and nearest neighbor learning.","Formal concept analysis; Global optimization; Lazy learning","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Global optimization; Information analysis; Classification technique; Decision tree learning; Information gain; Interpretability; Lazy learning; Nearest neighbor learning; Regression techniques; Tree-based methods; Formal concept analysis","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983400950

TextRank is an algorithm for unsupervised text summarisation. It has two main stages: first stage is representing a text as a weighted directed graph, where nodes stand for single sentences, and edges are weighted with sentence similarity and connect consequent sentences. The second stage is applying the PageRank algorithm as is to the graph. The nodes that get the highest ranks form the summary of the text. We focus on the first stage, especially on measuring the sentence similarity. Mihalcea and Tarau suggest to employ the common scheme: use the vector space model (VSM), so that every text is a vector in space of words or stems, and compute cosine similarity between these vectors. Our idea is to replace this scheme by using the annotated suffix trees (AST) model for sentence representation. The AST overcomes several limitations of the VSMmodel, such as being dependent on the size of vocabulary, the length of sentences and demanding stemming or lemmatisation. This is achieved by taking all fuzzy matches between sentences into account and computing probabilities of matched concurrencies. For testing the method on Russian texts we made our own collection based on newspapers articles with some sentences highlighted as being more important. Using the AST similarity measure on this collection allows to achieve a slight improvement in comparison with using the cosine similarity measure. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Algorithms; Directed graphs; Forestry; Text processing; Cosine similarity; Cosine similarity measures; PageRank algorithm; Sentence similarity; Similarity measure; Text Summarisation; Vector space models; Weighted directed graph; Vector spaces","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981502093

However, the known algorithms are able to process only simple instructions, including one verb with dependent words.

Social factors of health inequalities are a prominent research topic of study in recent decades. Results suggest that social and economic factors - including economic resources, living conditions, education, life style - affect health outcomes. These findings are verified for many countries regardless of measurement methods. And it is true across lifespan from birth and childhood to adulthood. It is especially worth paying attention to children's health because bad health in childhood is burdened twice - in addition to family expenditures on health care and medicines due to child's disease - poor health leads to lower level of human capital in future. This paper uses Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey data to estimate role of social and economic factors in children's health in Russia. Analysis was performed on a subsample of 0-6 year olds. Information about children's parents and households was matched to this subsample. Several health indicators were tested - permanent health perception, chronic conditions, and transitory health state. The results of the study show that all types of child health measurement are significantly connected to maternal health state and mothers' behavior, especially alcohol consumption. The findings provide no support for hypothesis about crucial role of main socioeconomic factors in health-family welfare, maternal education, mother's age, marital status, and employment status. These results provide evidence that there is a huge difference between key social factors of children health in Russia and most other countries. It is suggested that the reason for this fact is that Russian socioeconomic groups are likely not so different in behaviors, attitudes toward health life style, access to quality medical care as are social classes in other countries. © 2016 r.","Child health; Life style; Socioeconomic status",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981229153

We propose a special approach for the evaluation of the regional higher education system efficiency from the public administration perspective. Using data envelopment analysis (DEA), we investigate the efficiency of higher education systems in the regions and compare the results with the extent of higher education competition within them. The results indicate that higher efficiency scores and higher competition between HEIs in Russian regions are positively correlated. Moreover, by introducing socio-economic context status as a grouping parameter, we are able to specify the conditions of this relationship. The study explores that correlation between efficiency and competition is stronger in developing and low-performing regions. At the same time, higher education systems in developed regions consist of different HEIs, which create a competitive environment, although their efficiency level varies considerably. Taking into account all limitations of the study, these results contain several important issues for policy-making and higher education research discussions.

Design/methodology/approach: Secondary data analysis of hotels’ websites, annual reports and published interviews was conducted to investigate how hotels co-create the experience environment. Also, content analysis of tourist comments in social media was conducted to assess the relationship between customer engagement in value co-creation and customer satisfaction. The sample for this study includes hotels located in Moscow using customer experience as a source of value creation. Findings: Based on the analysis of best practice of customer engagement in value co-creation in the hotel industry, a classification of co-creation activity forms was developed. Five forms of co-creation activities have been identified: feedback, co-production, firm-driven service innovation, customer-driven customization and co-creation. Applied data also provide insights on the development of the hotel industry in Moscow. The majority of hotels engaging customers in value co-creation in Moscow are international. Hotels more often use customization, service innovation and especially co-production than co-creation, as co-creation is a new market strategy for the Russian market. The high-price-segment hotels more often use customization, whereas hostels usually implement value co-creation with clients. It can be explained by the difference between the target audience and the resources available. This study helps to understand whether forms of customer engagement in value co-creation in the Russian hotel industry match international experience and findings of theoretical studies. Research limitations/implications: The sample group represents only hotels in Moscow, and the study utilizes only qualitative techniques. An increase in both the sample size and geographical diversity and a study using both qualitative and quantitative techniques may generate more insights relating to customer engagement in value co-creation in Russian hotels.

Young, non-religious, educated people from big cities have started to consider non-marital union appropriate for childbearing and childrearing.

The main result of this moment in his career was the government reform in Asiatic Russia as well as the formulation in 1822 of a set of codes - rules and regulations - for Siberia and its peoples. Speranskiy tried to incorporate his theories on state and law into these codifications. One of these codes was the Rules on the Siberian Kirghiz which provided for a reform of the government system of the Kazakhs ('Kirghiz' in the Russian pre-revolutionary tradition) of the Middle Horde, who were under the control of Siberian regional authorities. The Middle Horde became a place where Speranskiy could experiment with his ideas. Previous researchers have paid more attention to the consequences of the promulgation of the 'Rules on the Siberian Kirghiz' for the later history of Kazakhstan. This paper clarifies which specific ideas of Speranskiy on state and law the Rules on the Siberian Kirghiz reflect, and answers the question of whether they had practical importance. A substantial part of the 'Rules on the Siberian Kirghiz' was, in fact, ineffective and would not be used in practice because of Speranskiy's lack of knowledge of the Kazakhs, and his underrating of their political and legal level. At the same time, the authority of Speranskiy in 19th century Russia as legislator and reformer was so high that his Rules on the Siberian Kirghiz remained in force until the 1860's, when the next substantial administrative reforms of the Kazakh steppe took place. © 2016 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Kazakh; legislation; modernization; reforms; Rules on the Siberian Kirghiz; Russian Empire; Speranskiy; traditional law",,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977276814

There is ample evidence that initial difficulties in this process might have lasting consequences. Main purpose of the paper is to analyze school-to-work transition of Russian youth. It is based on the results of a special survey of young people aged 15-29 conducted in 2012 in 11 regions of the Russian Federation. Funding for the surveys came from the Work-Youth partnership between the ILO Youth Employment Program and The MasterCard Foundation. Level of education is a key factor for a successful transition to the labor market. Post-secondary vocational and tertiary education, first of all the higher education, increases success of the school-to-work transition, increasing employment rate of graduates, significantly reducing risks of unemployment and economic inactivity, reducing length of transition. Young person with a university degree transited, on average, three times faster than the youth with lower secondary education. Our results indicate that young people with lower secondary education have highest risks of long unemployment and exclusion from the labor market. Combining study and work is also significant factor. Results show that young person who don't work during their studying spent, on average, twice longer time to complete their labor market transition than students who combine study and work. Youth living in urban areas have advantage in terms of completing the labor market transition but gap between gender and settlement groups decreases with education level growth. Duration of transition to the first job highlights a dichotomous situation: a large group of youth is able to obtain a job within three months after leaving school, while smaller part of youth faces very long transition time.","Jobless; School-to-work transition; Youth economic inactivity; Youth unemployment",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975148013

Berry (2013) proposed that intercultural relations can be understood on the basis of three hypotheses: the multiculturalism hypothesis, the integration hypothesis, and the contact hypothesis. Our goal was to test these three hypotheses in Russian majority and Asian minority groups. Migrants from Central Asia (N = 168; 88 ethnic Uzbeks and 80 ethnic Tajiks) and ethnic Russians (N = 158) were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire that included measures developed by the Mutual Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies project.

We found significant and positive relationships between perceived security and multicultural ideology in both groups. We found a positive relationship between intercultural contacts and the integration strategy among the migrants from Central Asia. Intercultural contacts in the group of Russians was positively related to the expectation of integration and negatively related to the expectation of assimilation. The integration strategy of the migrants was positively related to their self-esteem, while the assimilation strategy was positively related to their sociocultural adaptation and life satisfaction. Among the Russians, the integration expectation promoted their better life satisfaction and self-esteem. The multiculturalism hypothesis was partially supported with both the migrants from Central Asia and the Russians: perceived security promoted an acceptance of multicultural ideology but didn't promote ethnic tolerance. The contact hypothesis was partially supported in both groups: interethnic contacts were positively linked to the integration strategy of the migrants and the integration expectations of the Russians.

We report here the results of an empirical study of the intercultural relations, mutual acculturation, and adaptation of Kabardians and Balkars (N = 285) and Russians (N = 249). Specifically, we examine the relevance of three hypotheses formulated to understand intercultural relations: the multiculturalism hypothesis, the integration hypothesis, and the contact hypothesis.

Our goal was to test three hypotheses in the RNO-A: the multiculturalism hypothesis, the integration hypothesis, and the contact hypothesis. We conducted a sociopsychological survey. The sample included members of the ethnic majority, the Ossetians (N= 318), and members of the ethnic minority, the Russians (N= 327). Data processing was carried out using structural equation modeling (SEM) separately for the ethnic minority and for the ethnic majority, and the models were compared with each other. The results show that perceived security among the Russians (the ethnic minority) as well as among the Ossetians (the ethnic majority) promoted support for a multicultural ideology, tolerance, and mutual integration. The number and frequency of friendly intercultural contacts had a positive and significant impact on a preference for integration among both the Ossetians and the Russians. An integration strategy and the expectation of integration promoted life satisfaction in both groups.

The aims of this paper are twofold: To present new evidence on the use of, and payment for, outpatient and inpatient treatment in Russia; and to compare the motivations behind both official and informal payments for outpatient services provided in public medical institutions. Methods: This study uses data from a quantitative household survey conducted in April 2014. The sample comprised 1602 individuals aged a 3/4 18 years, representing the entire adult population of the Russian Federation. We studied three types of medical care: inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment and medicines. Results: Our study found that 22.2% of patients pay for outpatient services, 37.5% pay for inpatient services and 91.5% pay for outpatient medicinal treatment. The informal payments are almost equally met in both outpatient (13.4%) and inpatient (12.2%) care; while the official payments are more common in inpatient care (25.2%), compared to outpatient care (8.8%). The main reasons for informal payment include: improvements in the quality of care and gratitude for medical staff. The official payments are more frequently motivated by an inability to receive a certain treatment free of charge. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that both official and informal payments for medical treatment are widespread in Russia: Informal payments are strongly preferred over official payments for outpatient care, while official payments dominate in inpatient care. © 2016 the Nordic Societies of Public Health.","Bribes; drug payment; healthcare payment; healthcare system; informal payment; medical payments; medical services; out-of-pocket payments; pharmaceuticals; prescription drugs; Russia","adolescent; adult; ambulatory care; economics; female; financial management; health care cost; health care delivery; health care survey; hospitalization; human; male; middle aged; Russian Federation; statistics and numerical data; utilization; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Financing, Personal; Health Care Surveys; Health Expenditures; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Russia; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84971475755

An analysis of the judicial practice of recent years warrants the conclusion that standards of creativity as a criterion for copyrightability have dropped drastically. Today’s standards are similar to those of the former American ‘sweat of the brow’ doctrine. But, unlike foreign legal systems that set comparatively low standards of protectability, the Russian judiciary has not yet evolved mechanisms of compensation for risks of monopolization of public domain content. First of all, there is no practice of granting exclusive rights to a work that is similar to an earlier work but has been created independently. Secondly, the practice of refusing protection to non-unique, standard, generally known, and generally available content is dying out. Thirdly, there is currently a trend for giving a large scope of protection to works of low authorship. As a result, exclusive rights are granted to standard or generally accessible content – content that must belong to the public domain – which puts unjustified restrictions on the creative activities of other authors. Moreover, it makes their legal status unpredictable as it establishes a basis for unintended copyright violations being penalized. This amounts to a classical case of overprotection. © 2016, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

Adaptation of a company's internal aspects to the new market conditions has become the time feature. It should be noted that today's organizations are a complex network of individual and group interests. Organizational culture is the principle feature characterizing any (in our case, private) manufacturing plant. The research shows that organizational culture is conservative; however, it can adjust to changes in the internal and external environment. This paradox could be explained by the fact that organizational culture may exist in the minds of people who are able to adapt to the new situation but hardly change their beliefs. Analysis of the existing theoretical approaches and management practices in the field of organizational culture has allowed the authors to form a semantic field, which reflects interpretation of organizational culture and defines the purpose, nature and tools of managerial influence. The semantic field has its own specific strengths and limitations which can be used to maximize the company's profit. Thus, organizational culture of an enterprise is believed to be based on diversity or sometimes discrepancy of stakeholders' interests, assuming that in the context of organizational culture these interests are interdependent, since meeting one party's interests cannot be fully achieved when ignoring those of the other party. Hence a group of people expressing certain involvement can affect the balance of power and achieve their goals, pursuing their own interests. Such interdependence, different balance of power in decision-making on the nature and dynamics of organizational culture, availability of potential conflicts of stakeholders' interests, involved in this process and, finally, scarce resources of an enterprise tend to reinforce this influence on organizational behavior and organizational culture. The authors interpret organizational culture in terms of stakeholder theory and identified the four main positions of the stakeholders in the matrix describing stakeholders' influence and participation in organizational culture: Constitutive Stakeholders, Key Stakeholders, Adynamic Stakeholders, Extirpated Stakeholders. Besides, Influence, Involvement, Reception were specified as relevant attributes of stakeholders. It enables us to develop the method of detecting critical subjects, whose interests must be respected when forming the content-related configuration of organizational culture; critical issue is not how organizations should be built to maximize efficiency, but rather whose preferences and interests should be served by an organization. In this article the authors examine organizational culture in the context of coincidence or intersection of company stakeholders' interests. In view of this, the principle theoretical aspects of organizational culture and the stakeholder theory have been studied. The analysis of research into these problems has been used to identify stakeholder groups and develop the methods of their determination.","Influence; Interdependence; Organizational changes; Organizational culture; Ranking of stakeholders","Commerce; Complex networks; Decision making; Semantics; Societies and institutions; Influence; Interdependence; Organizational change; Organizational cultures; Ranking of stakeholders; Behavioral research","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969263682

The main objectives of the project were to 1) single out Internet resources aimed at collaboration to suit the purposes of educational programme; 2) determine how much collaborative learning background students have and their attitudes to online and face-to-face collaboration; 3) analyse the students’ involvement in collaborative learning activities; 4) research the influence of web-related technologies on willingness to collaborate. The main methods used in the research were questionnaire, interview and observation as well as analyses of students’ work. The results revealed a positive attitude to Web 2.0 among the majority of the students. The offered Internet resources (Tricider.com, MeetingWords.com, TodaysMeet.com) improved communication and collaboration outside of the classroom, which is vital as increasingly less time is being allocated for studying a foreign language.

As the segmentation algorithms usually make it possible to choose the degree of homogeneity of the features in a segment, we propose to associate each object with a set of such piecewise regular representations (granules). The coarse-grained granules stand for a low number of weakly homogeneous segments. On the contrary, a sequence with a large count of high-homogeneous small segments is considered as a fine-grained granule. During recognition, the sequential analysis of each granularity level is performed. The next level with the finer granularity is processed, only if the decision at the current level is unreliable. The conventional Chow's rule is used for a non-commitment option. The decision on each granularity level is proposed to be also sequential. The probabilistic rough set of the distance of objects from different classes at each level is created. If the distance between the query object and the next checked reference object is included in the negative region (i.e., it is less than a fixed threshold), the search procedure is terminated. Experimental results in face recognition with the Essex dataset and the state-of-the-art HOG features are presented.

The study is based on the conceptual scheme proposed by Burawoy, highlighting four different disciplinary practices: ‘professional sociology’, ‘policy sociology’, ‘critical sociology’ and ‘public sociology’. The formation of a ‘global sociology’ demands harmonious development and mutual enrichment between all the four ‘sociologies’, however, each of them has its own path in the global arena. The literature analysis demonstrates serious limitations in the global progression of ‘professional sociology’, while ‘policy sociology’ and ‘critical sociology’ also experience major difficulties. ‘Public sociology’, largely inspired by Burawoy, seems to be especially promising globally due to its key advantages: orientation towards non-academic audiences and a focus on the most acute social problems. However, currently this disciplinary practice has several fundamental constraints: marginality, radicalism, ideological bias and inherent conflict-orientation towards other ‘sociologies’. Drawing on John Meyer’s theory of ‘Scientized Environment Supporting Actorhood’, the article proposes the project of the new ‘Global Solidarity Sociology’, which utilizes the advantages of Michael Burawoy’s project while overcoming its principal limitations. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Global sociology; international sociology; professional sociology; public sociology; Scientized Environment Supporting Actorhood",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950327535

Following the logics of neoliberalisation (Harvey 2003), urban spaces progressively turn into investment mediums: the business elites deposit accumulated capital surplus in a growing number of new urban settings, thus making additional profits and coping with financial risks. This leads to a decrease in the proportion of industrial sectors in city economies in favour of the intensifying circulation of capital in real estate operations (Soja 1989). Formally, Russian national and city authorities withdraw from the regulation of the real estate market, but instead they turn into the key actors of this market, benefiting from exclusive control over the disposal of urban territories (Trubina 2011). As these processes unfold, city administrations and investors face the problem of vacant territories deficiency; new vacant spots for commercial construction are often procured through accumulation by dispossession (Harvey 2003) when urban territories pass from public to private ownership or are handed over to new leaseholders (Vorobyev and Campbell 2008). This process is particularly salient in St. Petersburg, which, unlike the majority of Russian cities, receives no federal supplements and thus bears full responsibility for replenishing municipal funds. © Kerstin Jacobsson and the contributors 2015.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064364674

As such, Russian economic development today is seen as yet another successful transition from a command to a market economy. This is a dramatic change of fortune. In the past Soviet economic performance was highlighted as a typical example of extensive growth, driven by high investment and labor input growth, with little improvements in technology and efficiency (Ofer 1987; Krugman 1994). But with the introduction of a market economy in early 1990s, it was expected that growth would become intensive, relying on improvements in productivity rather than input growth. Through the elimination of multiple price distortions of the planned economy, a better allocation of inputs among industries and increasing incentives for firms to diminish real costs of production, productivity should become the main driver of growth (Campos and Coricelli 2002). These benefits were not realized immediately, and as is well known the Russian transition triggered a deep crisis that finally bottomed out in the mid-1990s (see Figure 8.1). But since then, the trend in growth picked up and the benefits from the market economy seem to be finally realized, akin to the success of various other formerly planned economies in Eastern Europe (Fernandes 2009; Havlik, Leitner, and Stehrer 2012) and China. Recent growth accounting studies of Russia confirm this view and find that growth was mainly driven by improvements in the efficiency of input use, as measured by multi-factor productivity (MFP) growth, rather than growth in labor and capital inputs. Entov and Lugovoy (2013), Jorgenson and Vu (2013) and Kuboniwa (2011) all find that MFP growth was (much) higher than input growth in the period from about 1995 to 2008. Izyumov and Vahaly (2008) find that input growth is even negative in this period, and all output growth is due to MFP growth. These findings are consistent, despite the wide variety of methods and data used (as will be discussed in more detail below). © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045012113

On one hand, the bipolar system provided stability of international relations, but on the other, - lead to competition between the U.S. and the USSR for the influence on the third countries, which sometimes resulted in armed conflicts in the third states. The collapse of the Soviet Union convinced the West both in the universality of its development model and the necessity to spread it all over the world. Now it is clear that the ""democratism "" ideology failed politically and culturally. The Western model has neither become a panacea for eliminating disparities between countries on different stages of development, nor the only example of successful and strong governance. New power centers, such as Russia, China, India and Brazil, have been successfully developing after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Their influence has been growing along with that of the West, and even though they did not necessarily directly confront it, they never shared all its values, yet never actively imposed their positions on the rest of the world. Regional powers (Nigeria, Venezuela, etc.) are also playing a more significant role in the emerging system, although sometimes they may join the alliances with more powerful countries to achieve their goals (as Vietnam does with the U.S. in its conflict with China). Russia's reluctance to follow the West in its development created the first serious alternative to the existing unipolar world model and its values, so naturally and widely accepted by the Western actors. Whereas China with its rapid economic development is also posing a challenge to the ideology of ""democratism "" proving that the economic welfare is achievable outside the Western political model. As for Russia, its role in the modern world is still not defined. The Russian Federation wants to become an independent power unit and a center of the Eurasian integration. However, it is not clear whether it has resources of all kinds to implement this idea, - moreover, its economic dependence on the West is still too strong to insist on further confrontation. Instead, Russia (as well as its partners in the Eurasian Economic Union) could use Eurasian integration platforms to act as an ""ambassador "" of Asia in Europe and that of Europe in Asia.","Bipolar system of international relations; Post-bipolar world; Regional powers; The west and non-western centers of power; Western and eastern development models",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041508141

Modern measurement gives 2.10 m for both height and width. It follows that the sixth-century Samian foot was 26.25 cm, and there is much to support such a conclusion. However, a standard Greek foot was much longer. We are dealing here with two different systems. In the earlier one, the foot corresponds to the height of an average Greek man, and it measures a half of a cubit and a third of a pace.

Historically, the purpose of ratings is to achieve information transparency regarding a given body's activities, whether in the field of finance, banking, or sports for example. This book focuses on commonly used rating methods in three important fields: finance, sports, and the social sector. In the world of finance, investment decisions are largely shaped by how positively or negatively economies or financial instruments are rated. Ratings have thus become a basis of trust for investors. Similarly, sports evaluation and funding are largely based on core ratings. From local communities to groups of nations, public investment and funding are also dependent on how these bodies are continuously rated against expected performance targets. As such, ratings need to reflect the consensus of all stakeholders on selected aspects of the work and how to evaluate their success. The public should also have the opportunity to participate in this process. The authors examine current rating approaches from a variety of proposals that are closest to the public consensus, analyzing the rating models and summarizing the methods of their construction. This handbook offers a valuable reference guide for managers, analysts, economists, business informatics specialists, and researchers alike. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

The members have consistently consolidated their cooperation, expanded and deepened their agenda, coordinated their efforts aimed at the recovery and growth of their economies, and developed their engagement with other international organizations. This work continued during the Russian presidency in 2015. This article focuses on one dimension of BRICS performance: its engagement with international organizations. There are at least three reasons defining the relevance of this analysis. First, from its launch, the BRICS collectively pledged to build a multipolar, fair and democratic world order, which cannot be attained without cooperation with the key international organizations. Second, the objective of enhancing sustainability, legitimacy and effectiveness of the global governance architecture defines the need for the summit institution to rely on a flexible combination of models of engagement with other international institutions. Third, according to the concept note published by Russia on its BRICS presidency, one of its priorities was a transition to a qualitatively new level of engagement with international organizations. The analytical framework for the study builds on the theory of rational choice institutionalism. The calculus approach fits the analysis of summit institutions bringing together states from a wide range of cultures, continents and economic development. Its distinctive features clearly apply to the analysis of the origin and performance of the BRICS. First, members act in a highly strategic manner to maximize the attainment of their priorities. Second, summitry presents an arrangement for strategic interaction among leaders to determine the political outcomes. Third, rational choice institutionalism offers the greatest analytical leverage to settings where consensus among actors accustomed to strategic action and of roughly equal standing is necessary to secure institutional changes - the features typical of summit institutions. Fourth, the institutions are created by the voluntary agreement of the respective countries' leaders to perform specific functions and missions. In order to maximize benefits from the new arrangement, the founders may choose to engage voluntarily with existing institutions in a mode they regard as most efficient. The summit institution members' choice of partners, modes and intensity of engagement is accepted to be strategic, intentional and voluntary, aiming to compensate for efficiency in their performance. The models of engagement are not mutually exclusive but coexist, with their choice dependent on the policy area and type of organization. The models of engagement with the other international organizations reflected in the leaders' discourse indicate their place and role in the global governance architecture, imputed to them at their launch and subsequent evolution. The study applies qualitative and quantitative methods. Drawing on the content analysis of the BRICS documents, the author tracks dynamics of BRICS engagement with multilateral organizations and main models of engagement, comparing them with the previous summits. Findings from the study of BRICS engagement with international organizations confirm the hypotheses that the forum's choice of engagement model reflects its role and place in global governance architecture and depends on the policy area, phase in cooperation development and perception of the organization's relevance to the BRICS's objectives. The models are not mutually exclusive, but coexist, and transform in the course of cooperation. By establishing new institutions, the BRICS consolidates cooperation with other organizations. With United Nations organizations and the World Trade Organization, engagement occurs based on the model of catalytic influence (exerting influence on international organizations' changes through endorsement or stimulus, or by compelling them to reform), whereas with the BRICS's intention to engage on the model of governance in alliance with multilateral institutions remains unrealized. In 2015 the BRICS consolidated its preference in favour of two models: catalytic influence and parallel treatment (creation of the forum's own institutions). The BRICS continued to establish institutions. While strengthening its own institutions, the BRICS can be assumed to apply the model of governance in alliance with multilateral institutions when cooperating with relevant international organizations.","BRICS; Global governance; International Monetary Fund; International organizations; New Development Bank; United Nations; World Bank; World Trade Organization",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021384396

This article focuses on the institutional approach of three levels of interaction: the intergovernmental level (IGL) describes traditional contacts among heads of states or governments as well as among ministers; the transgovernmental level (TGL) consists of relations among civil servants of middle and low rank; and the transnational level (TNL) includes the dialogue of non-governmental participants such as business, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and epistemic communities. Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye identified TGL and TNL, but the studies of these levels has intensified as a result of burgeoning links among civil servants, business, NGOs and experts from different countries. Transgovernmental and transnational interactions stabilize relations among various actors. This article clarifies the stabilizing potential of TGL and TNL interactions. First, the degree of autonomy of civil servants from the political level of government has to be taken into account. Second, the state regulates the level of independence of both business and NGOs. TGL and TNL interactions can stabilize relations only if civil servants are independent from the political level in what concerns technical issues and where both business and civil society are strong. Third, real economic interdependence matters because it forms an agenda of cooperation in a particular field. The intensification of trade and investment flows does not automatically lead to real interdependence. In this case, contacts at the transgovernmental and transnational levels acquire a formal character and no cooperation emerges, which does not allow for stabilized relations in crisis situations at the IGL. The empirical section of the article demonstrates how widening and deepening relations between the European Union and Russia, especially since 2000, led to thickening transgovernmental and transnational interactions but these levels failed to stabilize relations between Moscow and Brussels following the 2014 Ukrainian crisis. On the contrary, the EU' s reaction (sanctions) led to the destruction of economic links at both levels, whereas Russia deconstructed transnational non-profit relations. Tensions at the IGL also negatively affected the epistemic community (a part of the TNL), leading to its politicization. Changes and fine-tunings in the concept of institutional levels of analysis, suggested in the article, help to explain recent developments in EU - Russian relations. The article also recommends purposefully restoring relations at the transgovernmental and transnational levels to facilitate overcoming of the crisis in EU - Russian relations.","Business; Civil society; Epistemic community; European Union - Russian relations; Interdependence; Non-governmental organizations (NGOs); Third sector; Transgovernmental relations; Transnational relations",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021341479

A strengthened EEC would also support the development of a common EEU position on China. Only on this basis will the EEU be able to develop the infrastructure and investment programmes necessary to strengthen trade with states in the SREB.

We discuss the general principles of how the inventory of adjectival roles should be organized in comparison with the existing inventories of verbal roles. In order to verify our statements, we carry out an experimental survey aimed at measuring the similarity between adjectival and verbal roles. The results have shown that both semantic interpretation of roles and their typical morpho-syntactic expression are significant for the evaluation and should be taken into account in working out the inventory.

The core of the problem is that in the Russian language of Russia the variant Belorussia is used, which is considered to be insulting by many Belarusians, who prefer to use the variant Belarus while speaking Russian. In an attempt to understand the structure of this conflict, we analyze how and why the toponym Belarus appeared and spread through the newspapers of 1990-s, study the data from two online polls and the distribution of some words derived from the two toponymic variants, and finally discuss the scenarios of conflict communication in discussions in various social media. One of the polls shows the social distribution of the two toponymic variants and the other examines the attitude of the Belarusians towards the toponym Belorussia and its derivates. We show that each side of the conflict has its own limited set of ideas that reappear in conflict communication in comments under different articles on the Internet.","Attitudes to language; Belarus; Conflict; Social media; Sociolinguistics; Toponymy",,"Russian",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020414777

Both tools provide lemmatization, part-of-speech and morphological annotation. One (""RNC"") was developed for annotating texts in the Russian National Corpus and is rule-based. The other one (""TOROT"") is being used for annotating the eponymous corpus and is statistical. We apply the two analyzers to the same Middle Russian text and then compare their outputs with high-quality manual annotation. Since the analyzers use different annotation schemes and spelling principles, we have to harmonize their outputs before we can compare them. The comparison shows that TOROT performs considerably better than RNC (lemmatization 69.8% vs. 47.3%, part of speech 89.5% vs. 54.2%, morphology 81.5% vs. 16.7%). If, however, we limit the evaluation set only to those tokens for which the analyzers provide a guess and in addition consider the RNC response correct if one of the multiple guesses it provides is correct, the numbers become comparable (88.5% vs. 91.9%, 93.9% vs. 95.2%, 81.5% vs. 86.8%). We develop a simple procedure which boosts TOROT lemmatization accuracy by 8.7% by using RNC lemma guesses when TOROT fails to provide one and matching them against the existing TOROT lemma database. We conclude that a statistical analyzer (trained on a large material) can deal with non-standardised historical texts better than a rule-based one. Still, it is possible to make the analyzers collaborate, boosting the performance of the superior one.","Lemmatization; Middle Russian; Morphological tagging; Old Russian; Rule-based approach; Statistical approach",,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020378789

The lexicon is aimed at detecting sentiment in user-generated content (blogs, social media) related to social and political issues. Its prototype was formed based on other dictionaries and on the topic modeling performed on a large collection of blog posts. Topic modeling revealed relevant (social and political) topics and as a result-relevant words for the lexicon prototype and relevant texts for the training collection. Each word was assessed by at least three volunteers in the context of three different texts where the word occurred while the texts received their sentiment scores from the same volunteers as well. Both texts and words were scored from -2 (negative) to +2 (positive). Of 7,546 candidate words, 2,753 got non-neutral sentiment scores. The quality of the lexicon was assessed with SentiStrength software by comparing human text scores with the scores obtained automatically based on the created lexicon. 93% of texts were classified correctly at the error level of ±1 class, which closely matches the result of SentiStrength initial application to the English language tweets. Negative classes were much larger and better predicted.

We show two approaches for the sentiment polarity classification: syntactic rule patterns and convolutional neural network (CNN). Even without domain specific vocabulary and sophisticated classification algorithms, rule-based approach demonstrates an average macro-F1 based rank among the participants, whereas domainspecific vocabularies show a slightly higher macro-F1 score, but still close to an average result. CNN approach uses syntax dependencies and linear word order to obtain more extensive information about object relations. Convolution patterns, designed in this approach, are very similar to rules, obtained with rule-based approach. In our proposed approach, the neural network was trained with different Word2Vec (WV) models; we compared their performance relative to each other.

The earliest witness of the original text, which Constantine wrote down at the end of the 9th century in the First Bulgarian Kingdom, is the Old East Slavonic manuscript dating to the end of the 11th- beginning of the 12th centuries (this manuscript is sometimes dated to a later period). The manuscript is remarkable for its graphic and orthographic features characteristic only for the earliest Church Slavonic sources of East Slavonic provenance; these sources are dated to the 11th century or to the beginning of the 12th century. At the same time, the manuscript attests phonetic innovations caused by the initial stage of the loss of the jer-vowels, such as ""new jat'"" and the change of e into o. On the basis of the earliest manifestations of the change of e into o in the written sources, the author argues that this phonetic change took place in the southern part of the East Slavonic area and first of all in the prefinal syllable before the final jer in the absolute weak position. Phonetic and orthographic peculiarities of the East Slavonic witness of the Didactic Gospel testify to the southwest Balkan provenance of its South Slavonic protograph, which must have been a Cyrillic one. (On the basis of lexical data, the southwest Balkan origin of Constantine's archetype was argued by the author elsewhere.) From the point of view of verbal morphology, the earliest witness of the Didactic Gospel seems to be one of the most archaic East Slavonic manuscripts, which is particularly testified by a number of forms of the root aorist. Special attention is devoted to the construction called ""relativer Attributivkonnex"" (Ch. Koch). It was discovered by scholars in a number of South Slavonic sources or in East Slavonic manuscripts which go back to the South Slavonic tradition, and is to be observed in the Didactic Gospel, too.","""relativer Attributivkonnex,"" Didactic Gospel; Constantine the Presbyteros; History of the Church Slavonic language; History of the Russian language; Old Church Slavonic; Old East Slavonic language; The change of e into o; The fall of jers; The new jat'",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014389640

A large number of Scandinavians (mosdy from Sweden and Gotland) migrated to Eastern Europe in the 9th - middle of the 11th centuries. This fact is clear from the historical, linguistic and archeological evidence accumulated to date. However, much is unclear about the results and significance of this migration. Particularly controversial is the question if and how it came to be related with the formation of the political structures of Rus' which united a variety of peoples (gentes) in Eastern Europe in the 10th - 11th centuries. In this paper I examine the elite of Kievan Rus' in the middle of the 10th century. The original sources from that time give us some valuable information on the political organization and social hierarchy of Rus'. Two of these sources are of particular importance: the treaty of 944 between Rus' and Byzantium (a copy is included in the Tale of Bygone Years) and the description of the embassy of Olga, princess of Rus', to Constantinople in 957 given by the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus in his treatise De Ceremoniis (II, 15). In my opinion there is some corresponding evidence on Rus' in these two texts which has not been noticed or articulated in the debates on the texts. Emphasizing these correspondences and referring to the witnesses of other sources I attempt a consistent de- scription of the elite of Kievan Rus'. I conclude that the Rus' of the middle of the 10th : century was, politically and territorially, an association of 25 non-tribal administrative units located mostly along the famous ""Route from the Varangians to the Greeks"". These units or most of them were headed by Scandinavian leaders who formally recognized a superiority of the Kievan prince. This model disagrees sharply with the picture created by the Rus'ian chronicles of the 11th - early 12th centuries which exalt the Rurikid dynasty and do not mention in their narratives any other competing leaders or clans. My study aims at verifying this picture and considering a contribution of the Scandinavians to political de-1 velopments in medieval Rus'.","10th century; Elite; Kievan Rus; Society",,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011977802

The fourth section discusses the discursive construction of trust; the author believes that narrative analysis is a perfect methodological decision (provided there is enough ""quantitative"" and ""qualitative"" data to contextualize its findings for correct interpretation) to identify the typological discursive constitution of trust in everyday practices; and illustrates such a potential of narrative analysis on a small example of semi-structured interviews with the Russian rural dwellers.

This is the first time in Russia that a strategic document has emerged underlining the importance of children's participation. However, the current system of monitoring the National strategy does not contain any clarification of what criteria will be used to measure the success of the strategy. A review of reports from Russia's regions on the implementation of this National Strategy provides evidence that a rather formal approach has been employed. In terms of children's participation, the implementation of the National Strategy requires the development of conceptual provisions and using methods to trace the development process of children's participation in decision-making for authorities, as well as the employees of educational institutions. This paper offers a new method to monitor the involvement of children in decision-making, which is characterized by information sources, the main quantitative and qualitative indicators and benchmarks that measure how well the goals of the National Strategy are being achieved. This research also employed performance assessment to increase the participation of children in decisions affecting them, both in Russia and in other countries. This article is based on data from a project implemented by authors commissioned by UNICEF. Special attention is paid to children's participation at the level of educational institutions and municipalities. The article presents the results of several sample surveys, including those that provided information on involving children more in decision-making during school time. The definition of the indicators used in evaluation is based on data from official statistics, as well as interviews with experts and children. The monitoring system used in the National Strategy needs to be updated due to an expansion programme in official statistical reporting and reflection conducted in the framework of the monitoring sample surveys of children. The method proposed in this research takes into account the priorities that are the basis upon which the system of indicators and monitoring tools were built. These priorities include giving children the chance to express their opinions; allowing free access to information; establishing feedback mechanisms; addressing the needs of children in law and justice; providing children with access to economic resources; involving children in the construction of civil society; shedding light on the active political stances of children and the media; tracing the influence of children on the process of political decision-making; establishing child-headed households; and the development, collection and analysis of statistical data on children. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.","Indicators Of Children's Participation; Interests Of Children; National Strategy; Statistical Monitoring; Statistics On Children",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009115332

One framework is based on the trade-offbetween disorder and dictatorship and introduces the notion of the institutional possibility frontier (IPF). The idea of IPF implies that social institutions can be situated on the continuum between two extrema of dictatorship and disorder; each point on the continuum has an associated level of social losses. It is implied that the dictatorship-disorder trade-offis more severe in some societies than in others. The other theoretical perspective focuses upon the role of total factor productivity (TFP) as a parameter underlying long run growth (TFP can be represented as a parameter A in the Cobb-Douglas function). It is possible to associate different social groups with different productivity factors in the Cobb-Douglas function and, further, with different institutional preferences on the dictatorship-disorder continuum. As a result, the linkage between TFP and IPF emerges and the effects of TFP can be interpreted in the framework of the IPF theory. The formalization of the linkage between two theoretical perspectives is presented in outline and it is shown that high TFP can mitigate the trade-offbetween dictatorship and disorder. The second part of the paper contains a tentative empirical analysis of the link between TFP and major institutional characteristics. It is demonstrated that this link is present and has from medium to high strength. An interesting innovation concerns the method of estimating TFP. By and large, the paper sheds some light on the nature of TFP and designates directions for further research on the fundamental conditions for high-quality development.","Institutional possibility frontier; Institutional quality; Quality of government; Social conflict; Sustainable economic growth; Total factor productivity",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85003481157

The study aimed to investigate the effects of situational task meaning and dispositional self-transcendence on productivity and flow experience. We present a pilot quasi-experimental study conducted in a student sample (N = 82) Students were asked to work in small-group settings on a creative task, which consisted in finding solutions to a social problem. Each group was randomly assigned to an instruction presenting the problem as happening either in a distant country (low-meaning) or in their home country (high-meaning condition). The outcome variables were measures of flow, perceived meaning of the task, and satisfaction with time spent working. The solutions generated by the students were rated by three experts. The experimental manipulation had a main effect on the quality of the resulting solutions, but not on the subjective experience of the participants. A number of significant interaction effects were found, indicating that the associations of self-transcendence with experiential outcomes tended to be linear under the low-meaning condition, but curvilinear under the high-meaning condition. The findings suggest that self-transcendence is particularly beneficial to flow in situations with unclear meaning, but very high levels of self-transcendence may hinder flow in highly meaningful situations. Overall, the findings suggest that self-transcendence can be considered as a disposition of the autotelic personality. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2016.","Autotelic personality; Flow experience; Personal meaning; Self-transcendence",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002859034

Changes in social situations, reductions in available play time, greater engagement of children in activities and many other factors can affect modern preschoolers' peer communication. Therefore, the effect of teacher-directed and child-directed teacherchild interactions on preschoolers' peer communication important to study.

It shows that the concept of social justice is interdisciplinary in nature and that it is considered from different positions within various disciplines: philosophy, political science, sociology, history, legal studies and social psychology. The main issues which are singled out in this analysis are the concept of justice as a regulator of social relations and the issues of social justice from the perspectives of the market economy, law, and inter-ethnic relations. The discussion focuses on the prospects of the philosophical, methodological and interdisciplinary foundations of various theoretical models of social justice, (including the limitations of the ones belonging to the Russian tradition). It also focuses on the issues of market context and reform specificity vs social justice as the basis for integration and harmony, and the challenge of designing new models of social policy. We highlight the temporal change in the character of the related debates-since the 2000s they have become more focused on solving the practical problems of social regulation and on a more dedicated search for conceptual approaches to their solution. Finally, two major dimensions of these studies are distinguished. The first considers social justice as the ideological basis of socio-political regulation, the second treats it as a practical tool of social policy. There is still a gap between them, but at the same time in several social domains (such as law, labour and international relations) there is a tendency towards reaching a rational compromise between them.","Integration; Interdisciplinarity; Social justice; Social policy; Social regulation; Theory of justice",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002374079

In particular, it looks at historical changes in the residential, educational and occupational mobility of Russians. The study contributes to the literature by extending the spectrum of institutional and historical contexts in which the (in)equality of opportunity has been considered so far, re-examining existing evidence by using alternative datasets and a different methodology. For the empirical investigation I utilize data from four representative cross-national surveys conducted in Russia in 1994, 2002, 2006 and 2013. Following the theoretical arguments developed in the comparative social mobility research and being informed by their empirical findings, I anticipated (1) a trend towards lesser openness in the late years of the Soviet era; (2) a temporary discontinuity of mobility patterns during the turbulent 1990s; and (3) a stagnation of social mobility in the more stable years of Russia's post- Soviet history. However, my findings reveal no unambiguous trends suggested by previous research, moreover they contradict some of the earlier evidence. In particular, I found (1) steadily decreasing residential mobility both in absolute and relative terms (implying the increasing closure of residential communities); (2) a weakening link between parental and child educational attainment in the post-Soviet era; and (3) the invariance of social fluidity in terms of occupational attainment both in the Soviet and post-Soviet periods. The article concludes by highlighting some of the remaining questions and possible directions for future research. Published here is the second part of the article. It begins with a discussion of loglinear modelling, a technique which is used to analyse mobility tables and to explore patterns of relative social mobility. In the rest of the article I discuss the empirical findings with regard to the three dimensions of social mobility outlined above.

Using cumulative indicators such as total fertility rate and life expectancy, it is possible to characterize the general trends of these demographic processes. However, such an approach does not properly reveal the changes in the number of children a woman has during the course of her life or the real life expectancy of a given generation. In other words, a proper assessment of the effects of demographic policies must rely on information about real (rather than hypothetical) cohorts. Such an assessment is only possible 20-30 years after the implementation of policies, because it takes time to collect the necessary data. Therefore it is only now that we can finally assess the effects the demographic policies of the 1980s. The analysis presented in this article utilizes official statistics on births and deaths from 1946 to 2013 and official estimates of the population age-sex composition between 1959 and 2014. For the period 1946-1958 we use unofficial estimates of the age-sex composition. Using this data for different real generations we calculate age-specific fertility rates, age-sex-specific mortality rates from all causes combined and from some causes of deaths. By exploring these indicators we find that the immediate effect of demographic policies of the 1980s was quite impressive: in 1987 the total fertility rate was at its highest and life expectancy at birth improved to the level of the mid-1960s. Additional positive consequences are found in changes in mortality and the fertility of several real generations. Nevertheless, long-term effects are less visible, bordering on negligible. These findings are discussed in the context of current demographic policies and conclude with tentative predictions regarding their long-term effects.","Anti-alcohol campaign; Demographic policies; Effectiveness of demographic politics; Maternity capital; Population reproduction in Russia; Real generations",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002251502

Special attention is paid to changes which have occurred in this sphere under the influence of the financial crisis and the subsequent stagnation of the Russian economy (2008-2013), compared to the recovery period of economic growth in the 2000s. Our research is based on data from the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS). Our findings confirm that the earnings of those who participated in adult vocational training initially grew faster than the earnings of those who did not. The returns on adult education were moderately and negatively affected by the crisis and the stagnation of the Russian economy. This is also revealed in the prolonged decrease of participation in adult vocational training and the growing uncertainty of its outcomes. These findings are discussed in contrast to the results found in the literature. In discussing our findings we draw attention to the minor role played by the corporate sector in financing adult vocational training in modern Russia, compared with Russia's late Soviet period and with the situation in developed countries. To explain this phenomenon we employ theoretical models by Becker, and Acemoglu and Pischke who explain the distribution of investment in general and specific parts of human capital by specific labour market configurations (e.g. state regulation of employment and skill premiums, level of inter-firm mobility). We conclude that adult vocational training in Russia features both positive and negative trends, and emphasize the constraints which limit the successful post-industrial educational modernization in Russia.","Education finance; Human capital; Labour market; Life-long learning; Post-industrial educational modernization; Skill premiums",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002188856

In the beginning the subjects were giving objects, shown to them, categories with or without different types of conceptual combinations, and then memorized additional visual information about objects, which included categorical, i.e. frequent, and individual, i.e. rare qualities. As a result of the study we found out that in all contexts, both with conceptual combinations and without them, the subjects successfully formed prototype of category and recognized old examples of categories. Along with that, only under the conditions of usage of conceptual combinations (both typical and atypical) in relation to objects with reduced quantity of categorical information the subjects demonstrated categorical perception effect, i.e. considered these objects as seen before. Moreover, only with the usage of typical conceptual combinations, as distinct from the usage of atypical ones, the subjects successfully recognized objects with new qualities. We discuss the discovered differences as a manifestation of two functions of conceptual combinations in categorical effect of perception: drawing of attention to the category's core and underlining category's differences from other categories.

In the second wave 18 months later the levels of subjective well-being and vitality were measured again in 86 of the participants. The results showed that the effect of the economic crisis was associated with personality resources more than with socialdemographic data. The filtering function was revealed only for purpose in life and self-control coping while for hardiness, optimism and planning coping the effect was much weaker. Buffering function showed itself more pointedly than filtering one. Moreover, the buffering function was shown for all the resources separately as well as for integral index of personality resources (IPR). However, buffering function was revealed only regarding the dynamics of subjective well-being as a dependent variable, but not for the dynamics of vitality. In particular, the subjective wellbeing of those who had low level of IPR depended more on the effect of economic crisis than in those who had high level of IPR.

Two mathematical models underlying these approaches are considered. If the trader can treat price changes for each financial instrument of her interest as those of a random variable with a known (for instance,a uniform) probability distribution,one of these models allows the trader to formulate the problem of finding an optimal composition of her portfolio as an integer programming problem. The other model is suggested to use when the trader does not possess any particular information on the probability distribution of the above-mentioned random variable for financial instruments of her interest while being capable of estimating the areas to which the prices of groups of financial instruments (being components of finite-dimensional vectors for each group) are likely to belong. When each such area is a convex polyhedron described by a finite set of compatible linear equations and inequalities of a balance kind,the use of this model allows one to view the trader’s decision on her portfolio composition as that of a player in an antagonistic game on sets of disjoint player strategies. The payoff function of this game is a sum of a linear and a bilinear function of two vector arguments,and the trader’s guaranteed financial result in playing against the stock exchange equals the exact value of the maximin of this function. This value,along with the vectors at which it is attained,can be found by solving a mixed programming problem. Finding an upper bound for this maximin value (and the vectors at which this upper bound is attained) is reducible to finding saddle points in an auxiliary antagonistic game with the same payoff function on convex polyhedra of disjoint player strategies. These saddle points can be calculated by solving linear programming problems forming a dual pair. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Convex polyhedron; Equilibrium points; Financial instruments; Integer programming; Linear programming; Mixed programming; Price-taking traders; Random variable probability distribution; Two-person games on sets of disjoint player strategies",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992317467

The discussion is based on the ideas of social constructivism, although the authors explicitly acknowledge several possible limitations of this approach in sociological studies. Specifically, they argue that the processes of nation buildng should take into account the specific historical context, which may or may not enable nation building through certain types of state effort (e.g. national censuses). The article begins with a discussion of the general mechanisms by which the state attempts to represent people comprehensibly and unambiguously in categories by means of establishing symbolic boundaries to separate them. This is necessary both for primary selfidentification and for maintaining and reproducing national identity in general. A census may therefore be regarded as a way of conveying such categories to the population. The authors further discuss how the use and publication of official census data affects everyday interactions among people and their perceptions of the nation's social structure. The article draws on examples of how different ethnic groups were represented during the first Soviet census. It also develops the argument by drawing on examples of categorization by means of official documents, i.e. passports. The authors show that citizens were in fact attributed with an additional external ethnicity, which appeared to be independent from their own self-identify. The paper concludes that through such document-based identification, ethnicity became symbolically separated from its bearers, and therefore it has ceased to be an inherent individual characteristic.","Categorization; Ethnical group; Identity; Nation; National census; Social construction; V.A.

In particular, it looks at historical changes in the residential, educational and occupational mobility of Russians. The study contributes to the literature by extending the spectrum of institutional and historical contexts, in which the (in)equality of opportunity has been considered so far, re-examining existing evidence by using alternative datasets and a different methodology. For an empirical investigation I utilize data from four representative cross-national surveys conducted in Russia in 1994, 2002, 2006 and 2013. Following the theoretical arguments developed in the comparative social mobility research and being informed by their empirical findings, I anticipated (1) a trend towards lesser openness in the late years of the Soviet era; (2) a temporary discontinuity of mobility patterns during the turbulent 1990s; and (3) the stagnation of social mobility in the more stable years of Russia's post-Soviet history. However, my findings reveal no unambiguous trends suggested by previous research, moreover they contradict some of the earlier evidence. In particular, I found (1) steadily decreasing residential mobility both in absolute and relative terms (implying increasing closure of residential communities); (2) a weakening link between parental and child educational attainment in the post-Soviet era; and (3) the invariance of social fluidity in terms of occupational attainment both in the Soviet and post-Soviet periods. The paper concludes by highlighting some of the remaining questions and possible directions for future research. Published here is the first part of the article. In this part I first draw substantive distinctions between the notions of relative and absolute social mobility and their relevance for the interpretation of data about social mobility in Soviet and post-Soviet Russia. This is followed by a discussion of the theoretical considerations, from which I draw the hypotheses, and the methodological aspects, which underpin further analyses.

Work in the police is considered to be risky, highly demanding, and very responsible. Both government and society expect excellent work from police officers. A country's development defines the development of its institutions, including the police, which is why many transition economies went through police reforms recently. One of the reforms' targets was the wage of police officers. Unfortunately, the police force is a very closed social group and can rarely be identified in household surveys, so information is scarce. However, it is very important to know and understand how wages are determined in the police force and if there are any differences among countries with transition economies. How much do the wages vary inside the police? This paper is aimed at analyzing the wage formation mechanism in Post-Soviet countries like Kazakhstan and Russia and in Eastern European countries like Bulgaria and Latvia. In 2012, the highest average monthly wage was to be found in Bulgaria (1,428) and the lowest was in Kazakhstan (595). A regression analysis on the collected data from police officers' interviews (with a sample size of 1,854 policemen) showed that education, tenure, department, and rank determined police wages but also that the factors differed from country to country. Education is the crucial factor in Bulgaria and increases wages by 27%, while in other countries education has no effect on police wages. In Russia, the most significant influence on wages is rank. The higher-ranked police officers receive up to 55% more than lower-ranked officers do.","Bulgaria; Determinants of wage; Kazakhstan; Latvia; Police; Police department; Russia; Wage",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989168581

In this review we discuss several arguments to consider fertility as a socially embedded process. The notion of social embeddedness expresses the shift from the macro and micro levels of analysis to the meso level, disclosing the influence of weak ties (friends, peers and co-workers) and network mechanisms on bearing children and becoming parents. The integration of social influence models into the research on fertility behavior enables students to explain the gap between intentions to have a child and actually becoming a parent in terms of interaction between weak and strong ties. The impact of network mechanisms is tested for different number of births, timing of marriage, and transition to parenthood. Several types of network mechanisms are distinguished: social learning, social contagion, social pressure and social support. Social learning concerns circulation of relevant information and experience exchange with friends, peers and co-workers. Social support involves mobilization of strong and weak ties for material and emotional maintenance in pregnancy, childbearing, childcare, and decision making on new births. Social learning and social support play a decisive role in reducing uncertainty and costs related to childbearing and childcare, especially for countries will low levels of economic sustainability and generalized trust. Social contagion and social pressure are mechanisms that express vertical and horizontal processes of social diffusion related to the spread of social norms and settings on marriage and parenthood. A network approach provides new insight on the role of education, age and religiosity in fertility decisions.","Mechanisms affecting fertility behavior; Network effects on fertility; Social networks; Strong ties; Weak ties, generalized trust",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989166252

The number of CWD identified in regular population surveys is not sufficient to allow a comprehensive analysis. Given this situation, population censuses become the main source of data on CWD. Censuses provide a list of current pension beneficiaries on disability. However, as access to this data was opened only recently, it has not been possible to use this information to provide a comparative analysis of the opportunities of CWD and their families. The aim of this article is to analyse the status of CWD and their parents living in private households identified by censuses 2002 and 2010, and to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the censuses data on CWD. Both censuses point at some pronounced inequalities. Parents of the CWD are less educated and less professionally trained. Unemployment among mothers of the CWD is much higher. Finding a job is an issue that is especially acutely felt in rural areas. The percentage of rural families in which both parents are jobless is higher than in urban areas. This makes a personal subsidiary plot highly important for rural families with CWD. Participation of CWD in pre-school and school education rose between the censuses but a gap still persists. CWD live in single-parent families more often than other children. However, CWD are still extraordinarily underestimated in both censuses: more than 50 % of CWD were omitted. This huge discrepancy could point to bias in census estimates and, perhaps, this has led to an exaggeration of the differences revealed between families with CWD and other families with children. This drawback is methodological in nature and due to unclear instructions in classifying pensions by their types. Although these 'state-of-art' statistics on children with disabilities are, in fact, rather poor, we suggest a few simple steps to improve the situation. One of them would be to put the direct question about 'official' disability in the censuses.","Children with disabilities; Disability; Families with children with disabilities; Population census",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988624712

During the criterion construction we had to deal with a number of common recommenders' problems: A) Most of users rate only a random part of the objects they consume and a part of the objects that were recommended to them; b) Attention of users is distributed very unevenly over the list of recommendations and it requires a special behavioral model; c) The value of the user's rate measures the level of his/her satisfaction, hence these values should be naturally incorporated in the criterion intrinsically; d) Different elements may often dramatically differ from each other by popularity (long tail-short head problem) and this effect prevents accurate measuring of user's satisfaction.

Psychological content and experience of choice are emphasized. We suggest to take into account in empirical research both formal and content characteristics of the choice as well as its development within the time, including a change of choice after negative feedback - both direct (the failure to achieve the main goal) and indirect (implicit failure of the other goals that are not main for the task) ones. The aim was to study choice and change of action strategy in the task (that is presented as a game) after indirect negative feedback in two different condition. In the experiment we asked 170 students of psychological majors to choose an action strategy (quantity of ""energy"" to invest in achieving the goal) in a game situation on the computer. In the neutral condition (""simple choice"") final goal was formulated as a win for the character (young man achieving his career goals). In the motivating condition (""meaningful choice"") participants were asked to play the role of a psychologist who helps the character to achieve goals that are important for him. In the motivating condition, in contrast to neutral one, the task was perceived as more difficult; respondents tended to change the chosen action strategy readily after indirect negative feedback (success against the main goal, but the implicit failure in the overall reduction of ""energy""). In the neutral condition psychological factors of self-regulation (planning; reflective orientation in the planning and failure; acceptance, rumination, focusing on the problem, positive reappraisal as strategies of cognitive regulation of emotions) predicted the stability of choice. In the motivating condition focusing on the problem, positive reappraisal, and reflective orientation in failure were associated with confidence in the choice made, but not with its stability.","Action control; Change of action strategy; Cognitive regulation of emotions; Psychology of choice; Self-regulation of behavior; Stability of the decision",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984618902

The authors review the major trends of global value chains' development, specific features of Russia's participation in them, and the necessary steps to increase the quality and efficiency of this participation, in particular in the changing geopolitical context. Special attention was paid to the theoretical, methodological, and empirical aspects of GVC research which are far from adequate (we primarily mean international databases such as TiVA and WIOD developed with the participation of the OECD and the WTO): they need to be supplemented with advanced tools to improve their forecasting potential, as well as their practical and strategic orientation.

The application of Foresight methodology may significantly contribute to researching the GVC phenomenon, being a major logical step towards creating advanced research and policy tools to mobilise available resources and coordinate stakeholders' actions to increase global competitiveness. The paper presents several case studies which describe the practical application of Foresight methodology to analyze Russian participation in various GVCs, giving examples of specific product and service groups.

This preliminary study aims to identify perceived CM levels among Thai and Russian professionals working in international companies; to investigate possible correlation between personal factors (i.e. age, work experience, their perceived level of oral English proficiency, frequency of their attendance at meetings conducted in English, and frequency of English usage in their workplace) and CM; to compare these factors and the conditions in which CM may be developed among these two groups; and to predict the possibility of the development of CM. A quantitative method was employed and responses to the specifically designed questionnaire were obtained from 60 participants. The findings revealed that Russian participants were rated as very good users of CM, while Thai participants were only rated as fair CM users. In general terms, for both groups, only the frequency of English language use in the workplace was found to correlate with the perceived CM. The frequency of English language use in their workplaces was the only factor for the Thai participants to predict the development of CM.

They see the solution of this problem in the establishment of an adequate mechanism of functioning of agrarian production branches, which would influence these branches and thus increase their effectiveness. However, the existing developments and the utilized mechanism are not perfect and do not reflect the ability to significantly improve the situation in the field of agriculture. In this regard, a task of improving the existing mechanism by focusing its action on the radical improvement of the situation in agriculture remains relevant. The improvement process is not simple. It implies a coherent implementation of the following stages: study of the existing developments of the mechanism of agriculture for their presence; characteristics of the features of the selected criteria and the internal structure of the mechanism elements; classification of these developments according to research purposes and elements included in the mechanism; identification of the shortcomings of the created models using the evaluation of the rational correlation of internal components; justification of the choice of the areas of improvements based on the establishment of classification groups of the mechanism models.

To alleviate this problem different data collection approaches have been proposed. One of the promising techniques is to use unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In spite of several papers advocating this approach, there have been no system designs and associated performance evaluation proposed to date. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a new WSN design, where UAV serves as a sink while Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is used as a communication technology. We analyze the proposed design in terms of the network lifetime and area coverage comparing it with routed WSNs. Our results reveal that the lifetime of the proposed design is approximately two orders of magnitude longer than that of the routed WSNs. Using the tools of integral geometry we show that the density of nodes to cover a certain area is approximately two times more for routed WSNs compared to our design. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2016.","BLE; Performance; Sensor networks; System design; UAV","Design; Internet; Sensor networks; Systems analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Bluetooth low energies (BLE); Communication technologies; Design and analysis; Integral geometry; Network lifetime; Orders of magnitude; Performance; Wireless sensor system; Wireless sensor networks","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979021289

Alice receives a value of a random variable X, Bob receives a value of another random variable Y that is jointly distributed with X. Alice’s goal is to transmit X to Bob (with some error probability ε). Instead of one-way transmission we allow them to interact. They may also use shared randomness. We show, that for every natural r Alice can transmit X to Bob using (1 + 1/r) H(X|Y)+r+O(log2(1/ε) bits on average in 2H(X|Y)/r +2 rounds on average. Setting r = ┌√H(X|Y)┐ and using a result of [2] we conclude that every one-round protocol π with information complexity I can be compressed to a (many-round) protocol with expected communication about I + 2√I bits. This improves a result by Braverman and Rao [3], where they had I + 5√I. Further, we show (by setting r = ┌H(X|Y)┐) how to solve this problem (transmitting X) using 2H(X|Y)+O(log2 (1/ε)) bits and 4 rounds on average. This improves a result of [4], where they had 4H(X|Y) + O(log 1/ε) bits and 10 rounds on average. In the end of the paper we discuss how many bits Alice and Bob may need to communicate on average besides H(X|Y). The main question is whether the upper bounds mentioned above are tight. We provide an example of (X, Y), such that transmission of X from Alice to Bob with error probability ε requires H(X|Y) + Ω (log2 (1/ε)) bits on average. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Communication complexity; Information complexity; Slepian-wolf theorem","Computational complexity; Communication complexity; Error probabilities; Information complexity; One-way transmissions; Slepian-Wolf theorem; Upper Bound; Random variables","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977567940

Absence of large-scale research in the country determined the choice of the questionnaire developed by German colleagues, adapted as a primary tool of survey in schools. The experience of conducting research in the Nizhny Novgorod schools showed that educational system is a closed one and is often unprepared to participate in polls, including those relating to urgent social problems. Research results also clearly indicate presence of violence in Russian school and allow us to estimate its extent. School violence is diverse in form: from ""light"" verbal version to fierce physical coercion; in the Nizhny Novgorod schools vandalism, violence against teachers, and other forms also exist. Experience of students' participation in acts of violence is considered from the position of the aggressor as well as from the perspective of the victim; socio-demographic factors (type of school, gender, age) are taken into account. In the article destructive actions of students are analyzed from the point of view of family (socializing) experience. The family, as primary medium of forming child's personality, creates social/regulatory parameters of his/her activity outside family, including the school.

His/her well-being and comfort is destroyed by ignoring his/her concerns and interests, by application of hard (using physical force) methods of influence.

In culturally diverse social contexts, virtually every person experiences intercultural contact on a daily basis. It is essential to understand that there must be both cultural diversity and equity in social participation for true multiculturalism to exist in these settings. Beyond its core definition, it is clear that multiculturalism is a complex concept encompassing many dimensions and meanings. First, the term is understood to describe a demographic fact, indicating the existence of cultural diversity in a society. Second, multiculturalism refers to the policies and programs that are in place to manage intercultural relations and acculturation. Third, multiculturalism refers to psychological phenomena, including individual attitudes and ideologies that accept or reject the demographic, civic and policy features of multiculturalism. This chapter considers Canadian multiculturalism policy, examining how the multiple meanings of multiculturalism vary around the world. Within this framework, I highlight the psychological processes and outcomes of multiculturalism, particularly in connection with acculturation, adaptation and intercultural relations and consider whether these processes and outcomes differ for dominant and non-dominant groups. I suggest some ways in which to enhance the positive outcomes of intercultural contact and the resultant acculturation outcomes. Finally, this chapter sets the stage for the presentation of the other chapters in this volume. It elaborates three hypotheses derived from Canadian multiculturalism policy: the multiculturalism, integration and contact hypotheses. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2016.","Acculturation strategies/expectations; Integration; Intercultural contact; Multiculturalism",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973369928

Ethnocultural identity is based on the desires of the individual and the nation viewed integrally; it is achieved in substituted forms through integration in the cultural and symbolic space of society. The aim of this article is to analyze the meaning-of-life and value orientations of Armenian and Russian students in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Armenia. In order to study ethnocultural identity as part of the self-concept we carried out a study with students at the Russian-Armenian (Slavonic) University (Yerevan, Armenia) and the South Federal University (Rostov-on-Don, Russia): at the initial stage we conducted two focus groups (the number of respondents in each group was 10); at the second stage we conducted a study the number of respondents was 160. When the Armenian and Russian youth described their ethnicity, high values of social self - in particular, national civic identity - correlated with high and medium levels of meaning-of-life orientations. Armenians and Russians in title ethnos and in the associated diaspora had a number of similarities and differences in value orientations. The majority of respondents in the focus groups noted their positive emotions connected with being Armenian or Russian. The ethnic Russians in Armenia pointed out the ease of communication with Russian speakers, regardless of ethnicity, but noted the difficulty of social interaction because of their insufficient knowledge of the Armenian language. The formation and development of ethnic self-consciousness may be carried out at two levels: understanding the values and ideas of ethnicity and assessing the ethnocultural and ethnopsychological features of one's ethnic group. The ethnic identity of Armenians in Russia has been transformed, and they are now characterized by similar values as ethnic Armenians in Armenia. Ethnic Armenians and ethnic Russians are in continuous interaction in Armenia and in Russia. This interaction is a key to positive ethnic attitudes in both groups as evidenced by their tolerance for other ethnic groups and their solidarity and it enriches the representatives of both ethnic groups at the regulatory value level, making them carriers of both culture. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2016.","Ethnocultural identity; Meaning-of-life orientations; Value orientations",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973325104

These hypotheses were derived from the Canadian multiculturalism policy (Berry, 1984), and their validity has been assessed in a number of countries. Our goal was to evaluate these hypotheses in Russia (Moscow) and Latvia (Riga). We used sociopsychological surveys of two dominant groups (Russian Muscovites and Latvians in Riga) and two nondominant groups (migrants from the Caucasus in Moscow and the Russian minority in Riga) employing structural equation modeling. A sense of perceived security promoted tolerance toward other cultural groups in three of the samples. Perceived security was related significantly to multicultural ideology in Riga, but there was no significant relationship to multicultural ideology in the Moscow samples. A preference for the integration strategy among the migrants in Moscow as well as among the Russians in Latvia promoted their better sociocultural adaptation and had a significant impact on the life satisfaction of the Muscovites but had no impact on the Latvian sample in Riga. Our results provided some support for the effect of intercultural contact on the acceptance of others in three of the groups: the migrants in Moscow, the Russian minority in Riga, and the dominant group in Moscow. However, among the Russians in Riga, the relationship between contacts and perceived security was negative. The multiculturalism hypothesis was confirmed with the dominant group in Riga and was partly confirmed with both the dominant and the nondominant groups in Moscow and with the Russian minority in Riga. The contact hypothesis received partial support with both groups in Moscow and the Russian minority in Riga but was not confirmed with the Latvians in Riga. There was partial support for the role of the integration strategy in promoting sociocultural adaptation and well-being among the migrants in Moscow and the Muscovites. These findings require additional analysis of the sociopolitical and historical context in Latvia in order to understand the psychological outcomes of acculturation among the Russian minority there. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2016.","Acculturation strategies/expectations; Integration; Intercultural contact; Intercultural relations; Life satisfaction; Multicultural ideology; Multiculturalism; Perceived security; Tolerance",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973279485

The idea of the eye of god can be related to symbolic representation of the celestial pole with stars revolving around it.

Various motifs of European Bronze Age decorations can be interpreted in similar way.

It is an interesting and important question because we believe that the transactions which generated the crisis were a form of KM. It is also a neglected question and this happens because KM we don't know any study about KM and the financial crisis of 2007 and its consequences. We use a conceptual study with applications methodology, divided in two parts; in the first part we review the economic and financial theories that may be applied to the analysis of the financial crisis as a KM topic, dealing with bonds, assets, shares and derivatives, and rationality and its limits; In the second we compare the KM and the economic theories and analyse in theory and in practice the growing complexity and the increased problems of the financial world from a point of view of KM. We conclude that in the end the crisis was created by a failure in the standards of KM and by the increase in practices with increasingly high KM needs and shortages. As a practical consequence we believe that KM has been seen as a tool for managing companies but it is much more than that. Therefore we suggest that KM should be applied to the managing of the financial markets in the near future. For scholars we believe that this paper opens a new avenue for research and a very important one. The paper's strength is also its big limitation - given the importance of the ""Casino Economy"" this one is only a very modest and first try in what we believe can be a new branch in KM analysis.

One of them was the collapse of the former Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the appearance of new independent states. There was a great transformation of political and socioeconomic life in many countries of Central and Eastern Europe. One important consequence of these changes was an increasing migration flow from and between many East European countries due to economic as well as ethnopolitical reasons. Another result was an increasing awareness of cultural diversity and its impact on acculturation, identity, intercultural relationships and social functioning, notably in ethnic minority and immigrant populations in these countries. This chapter addresses the processes and outcomes of acculturation of ethnic minority and mainstream populations in Eastern Europe. Acculturation and identity represent big issues especially for postcommunist countries that started the process of democratization after 1989. Following the collapse of the state system, these economic and political transitions gave rise to nationalism and other issues related to cultural diversity, identity and belonging. The uniqueness of this region is represented by two important characteristics that are presumably affecting acculturation processes and outcomes. First, in addition to the increasing number of migrants, these regions have large populations of sedentary, indigenous ethnic minority groups (e.g., Roma) that immigrated many generations ago, thereby creating a unique and unusual context of acculturation. Second, ethnic tensions and a policy of assimilation of ethnic minority groups have continually increased interethnic hostilities, negative attitudes and discrimination. Following the United Nations definition of geographical regions (United Nations, 2013), we examine acculturation in specific countries in Eastern Europe (Belarus, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Slovakia and Ukraine). In so doing, we provide a more focused view on Eastern European societies than was possible in the first edition of the Handbook, which presented a broader perspective on acculturation in European societies (Phalet & Kosic, 2006). The chapter is composed of four major sections. In the first three sections, we describe cultural diversity in these countries as well as their context of acculturation and policy toward ethnic minority groups. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048545093

We attribute this increased interest in the field of acculturation to several factors: first is the increase in worldwide migration, due to natural and man-made disasters such as war, conflict, poverty and famine, as well as to improved means of traveling over larger distances; and second is the increasing importance of understanding the link between culture and human behavior that has been advanced by those working in the field of cross-cultural psychology. This rapid growth has stimulated the need for the creation of a second edition. While we want to update the materials published in the first edition, we also want to present a more integrated and comprehensive book. More specifically, we have reduced the number of chapters (by merging topics that were treated separately in the first edition) and we have increased the length of the chapters (to allow for a more in-depth examination of the topic). Most important is the larger range of societies covered; in addition to the coverage in the first edition, we now include work from Africa, Central and South America, East and Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and South Asia. We hope that these changes will provide students, researchers and professionals with a more comprehensive and deeper understanding of the processes and outcomes of acculturation psychology. The over 50 authors of this Handbook represent the top researchers in the field of acculturation psychology. They provide materials well-tailored for both the beginner and advanced reader. This new edition emphasizes sophisticated levels of conceptualizing and empirical research. The scope of acculturation Contact between peoples of different cultures is certainly not a new phenomenon. Throughout human history, mankind has traveled around the world for various reasons, either in search of greener pastures, fleeing from persecution and catastrophe, to trade or to conquer and colonize or in search of adventure or fun. These activities have resulted in the meeting of peoples of diverse backgrounds. This process has led to changes in the original patterns of life and cultures of the peoples concerned, as well as to the formation of new societies. The meeting of cultures and the resulting changes are what collectively has come to be known as acculturation. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048539364

The field has also made great strides into many different areas of psychology including developmental, clinical and organizational. The 10 years following the publication of the first edition of this Handbook has seen highly regarded psychological journals regularly publishing topics central to acculturation. Some journals in their desire to stimulate research have come out with topical issues on migration (see, e.g., Child development, 2012). As Van de Vijver et al. (Chapter 6, this volume) point out, we are witnessing an exponential increase in acculturation studies. Compared to the about 1,500 studies registered in PsycINFO during the first 100 years of acculturation psychology research, over 7,000 records could be identified following a cursory search in PsycINFO for the period from 2000 to the time of this writing. Why this increase? We tried to answer this question in the introduction to this volume (Chapter 1), where we pointed out that intercultural contacts are on the rise for several reasons. These included (1) easier and faster means for people to travel over wider distances together with bilateral agreements between nations, such as the Schengen agreement, making traveling easier, albeit amid tighter security checks; (2) developments in information technology that have brought people into contact, who until recently were very much isolated from each other; (3) the unabated but sad and traumatic man-made disasters of uprooting and relocating thousands of people because of ethnic, political and religious conflicts together with natural catastrophes that force people to flee to different regions of the world; (4) economic developments and economic meltdowns are still with us, forcing people to relocate either internally or internationally to seek greener pastures elsewhere. All these phenomena are major sources of intercultural contact, and of acculturation; hence they are of great interest to acculturation psychology. To be able to face and tackle the challenges these phenomena pose, acculturation psychology should regularly review and revise its assumptions and theories with supporting empirical research. And it is this goal that we hope this Handbook achieves. Another goal with the first edition of the Handbook was to move away from acculturation theories that have developed predominantly in one sociocultural context, such as the United States (see, e.g., Chun, Organizta & Marin, 2002; Leong, 2014). © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038880022

A more detailed coverage of the various aspects of the concept can be found in other chapters in this Handbook, and in particular elsewhere in Part I of this volume. In its simplest sense, acculturation refers to all the changes that arise following contact between groups and individuals of different cultural backgrounds. A more formal definition was proposed by Redfield, Linton and Herskovits in 1936. They defined acculturation as “those phenomena which result when groups of individuals having different cultures come into continuous first-hand contact, with subsequent changes in the original culture patterns of either or both groups” (Redfield et al., 1936: 149). Redfield et al.'s definition is now regarded as the classical definition of the concept and is perhaps the one most cited by acculturation researchers. Nevertheless, the term is sometimes wrongly used and/or used as a synonym for assimilation. This is exemplified by an everyday expression such as “he is very much acculturated to …,” implying “he is very much assimilated into …,” a given society or culture. The rapid expansion and exchange of information, trade and economic harmonization have given rise to the concept of “globalization” (Berry, 2008) and idiomatic expressions such as “Westernization” in the current discourse in acculturation. Accompanying the growth in global migration, there has been a proliferation of new terms such as “biculturalism,” “multiculturalism,” “integration,” “resocialization” and “ethnic identity.” These terms have either been used as an alternative concept or interchangeably with acculturation. There is a need to clarify all of these other terms. While some of these terms will become clearer in this chapter, space does not permit a discussion of them all. Chapters 3 and 22 of this volume elaborate on concepts of ethnic identity and multiculturalism, respectively. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038859657

The authors emphasize that in a situation of economic crisis there should be a larger role for independent expertise in the development of new economic policies and economic decision making. But the potential of Russian think tanks can be utilized effectively only if there is a change in the structure of demand for expertise driven by the emergence of new stakeholders interested in high-quality policy research. In order to maintain professional standards and promote high-quality expertise, collective action by the think tanks themselves is equally important.

Randa Absel-Fatteh, Palestinian author Multiculturalism around the world The concept of multiculturalism has acquired many meanings in the past 40 years, and these meanings vary across societies. In the 1970s, Berry, Kalin and Taylor (1977, p. 1) made the distinction among three different meanings of the cultural diversity component of multiculturalism. First, multiculturalism is demographic fact: most societies around the world are now culturally diverse. Second, multiculturalism is an ideology: individuals and groups hold general views about their acceptance or rejection of this diversity. And third, some governments articulate public policies and develop programs with respect to the acceptability and promotion of diversity. These three features are closely related. Without the presence of diversity there is no need to be concerned with what people think about it, and there would be no need for governmental action. While there is no question that multiculturalism refers to the presence of cultural diversity in a society, a second core element of multiculturalism articulated by Berry et al. (1977) is that of equitable participation. A view of multiculturalism that only considers the existence of cultural diversity may lead to the emergence of separate cultural groups within a diverse society. In terms of the acculturation framework presented in Chapter 2 (Figure 2.3), diversity without equal participation will lead to separation or segregation; equal participation without diversity will result in assimilation or the pursuit of the melting pot; in the absence of diversity and equity, marginalization and exclusion will likely occur; but when both diversity and equity are present, integration and multiculturalism are found. In this section, we elaborate the multiple meanings of multiculturalism and how it varies around the world in terms of demography, ideology and policy. We also consider the outcomes of multiculturalism in terms of whether it has positive or negative consequences and whether these consequences are situated at the macro-, meso- or micro-level. In other words, as set out in Chapter 2 (Figure 2.4), which described the locus of intercultural strategies, we can consider the effects of multiculturalism for national societies at one end of the spectrum and for individuals at the other end, with an intermediate level of analysis attached to institutions, organizations, neighborhoods, communities and other groups. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026197907

One of the important policy measures is to support the development of high-tech, specialized clusters by forming new linkages and strengthening existing ones between small and medium-sized businesses, large enterprises, and research organizations. The starting point for an effective cluster policy is to define areas with high potential for clustering of these industries. The paper presents an original method to identify potential clusters and tests the method on Russian regions. We show that most of the state-supported pilot innovative territorial clusters are being developed in regions and sectors that have a high level of cluster potential. A typology of existing clusters depends on the index of clustering potential. We identified regions that have similar or comparatively favourable conditions for creating clusters in the pilot sectors.","Clusters; High-tech industries; Location quotients; Pilot innovative clusters; Regions; Russia; Small and medium enterprises",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021299042

We use automatic analysis of poetic texts by 10 poets, drawn from the Russian National Corpus, in order to find word forms that can have stress variation. The number of such forms for an individual speaker ranges between 30 and 200 words, distributed among different parts of speech. We propose a quantitative measure of overall stress variability independent of the corpus size and show that there is a tendency for this variability to diminish over time, at least in poetic texts.","Corpus-driven research; Intra-speaker variation; Lexical stress; Poetic language; Variation in phonology",,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020440068

Three phases of the import substitution process are detected. Before the external shock of the mid-2014, there was a moderate import substitution accompanied by output growth. Then, the economy adapted to the shock quickly (turbulent import substitution). After the adaptation phase, import substitution stopped despite the continued weakening of the ruble (import dependence stabilization). The most intensive import substitution was observed in manufacturing of food products, transport equipment, metals and metal products. However, most industries experienced virtually no import substitution: for most cases, a significant drop in imports in physical terms was not accompanied by the corresponding drop in value terms. We provide preliminary estimations of the prospects of import substitution by industries that account for both relevance and potential of import substitution. The relevance of import substitution (relative level of import dependence) was calculated as the share of imports of a commodity in Russian GDP relative to the world share. Import substitution potential was obtained from the modified Hausmann-Klinger approach that accounts for the world trade patterns in the form of links between commodities and input coefficients for the corresponding industries from the Input-Output table. Our preliminary estimations show that both the need for import substitution and the ability to replace imports exist in agriculture and manufacturing of food products, several machinery industries, manufacturing of footwear, paints and varnishes, cleaning preparations and perfumes.","Economic activities; Import dependence; Import substitution; Industry",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019854700

We compare the migration attractiveness of Russian regions in three ways: (1) applying APC analysis to registration data, separately for two periods: 2003-2010 and 2011- 2013; the reason for sampling these two periods is because there was a significant change in the migration statistics collection practices in 2011; (2) using the age-shift method to analyze the data of the 2002 and 2010 Russian Censuses; we offer a way to refine the census data by discarding the non-migration-related changes in the age-sex structure; (3) using information about the average ratio of full-time university enrolments to the number of high school graduates in the academic years 2012/13 and 2013/14 across the regions. Based on the four indicators of migration intensity (intercensal estimates, statistical records for the two periods, and the graduate-enrolment ratio), we develop a ranking of the regions of Russia in migration attractiveness for young adults.

One of possible solutions to the problem could be placing the spacecraft near the asteroid and connecting it to the surface by tethers [1,2]. To analyse dynamical properties of such system, one can use a number of simplified models, e.g., a light tether with material point at its end [3]. Besides, modelling of asteroid gravitational field represents a serious challenge since its mass distribution is usually irregular. Therefore, the choice of an adequate description for the gravitational field which would also be suitable for analytical studies is far from an obvious task. One of existent options is to model the asteroid gravitational field as a composition of three attraction centers [4]. Analysis of motion in gravity fields of triangles has been performed, e.g., in [5,6]. Using complex masses and distances to describe potentials of gravitating bodies [7], some advances have been achieved substituting the point masses in triangular model by a combination of real or complexified dumbbells [8]. We study relative equilibria of a tethered body in the non-spherical gravitational field of an asteroid; these equilibria can be used to place spacecraft in the vicinity of the asteroid surface. We consider tether oscillations and analyse the system feasibility. Copyright © 2016 by Dr. Alexander Burov.

It is shown that under the influence of economic crisis income inequality has slightly decreased but still remains high. Non-monetary inequalities are tightly related to monetary ones; they are seen not only in the high level of differentiation of Russians' everyday life, but also in life chances typical for 2different social groups of Russians. Representatives of low-income groups of the population have a low quality of life not only in areas directly related to income (food, clothing, housing, provision of durable goods), but also in their work situation, opportunities for education, private security etc. Moreover, they have little or no opportunity to improve their lives and achieve desirable life models even in the aspects associated not with the quality of life, but with the creation of comfortable social environment on the micro level. This situation is not a result of the economic crisis - socio-economic situation in the country even before its start was characterized by high monetary and nonmonetary inequalities, although the crisis has brought some adjustments to the overall picture. Changes affect entire population. But for social groups with higher incomes they affect not just financial conditions, but quality of their life standards. Consequences of these trends are inconsistent. On the one hand, they contribute to reduction of social inequalities that are quite acutely perceived today by the population. On the other - such dynamics indicate that the most well-off mass social groups of society are deprived of opportunities to maintain the standard and way of life they have developed over a period of relatively stable economic development. This will inevitably begin to generate social tension in these social groups.","Impact of crisis; Incomes; Life chances; Social inequalities; Standard of living",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014313993

However, the main question of what is thought still remains unanswered. The origins of the issue lie in the definition of the original unit of analysis, i.e. in the definition of what lies at the heart of image, belief, imagination, speech, consciousness, and thinking. Based on available studies, results of which were reflected in recent publicationsit was argued that thought should be such an original unit of analysis. This article explores the concept of thought based on cognitive constructs and the neurophysiological correlates of mental activity. The present study is addressed to discuss issues dealing with the nature of thought, its content and structure, and the relationships between indicators of substantial thought and the neurobiological correlates of the process of thinking. Structurally thought is based on needs, emotions and intensions, and as such, thought defines the substantive essence of an image and also represents consciousness. Coherence of thoughts and consciousness, their integrity reflect the connectivity of things from the external world in their entirety. Thus, the ability to generate thoughts and build relationships within the stream of consciousness characterizes the human mind. It is shown that thought as a cognitive substance emerges from desires and experiences, as well as from conscious perception. Taken together, the described psychological and neurophysiological assumptions open up new horizons for research into human mental activity, thinking abilities and consciousness.","Cognitive neuroscience; Motivation; Thinking; Thought; Thought generation",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012927833

In the context of repulsive-U Hubbard model and Shubin–Vonsovsky model we consider briefly the superconducting phase diagrams and the symmetries of the order parameter in novel strongly correlated electron systems including idealized monolayer and bilayer graphene. We stress that purely repulsive fermion systems are mainly the subject of unconventional low-temperature superconductivity. To get the high temperature superconductivity in cuprates (with TC of the order of 100 K) we should proceed to the t–J model with the van der Waals interaction potential and the competition between short-range repulsion and long-range attraction. Finally we note that to describe superconductivity in metallic hydrogen alloys under pressure (with TC of the order of 200 K) it is reasonable to reexamine more conventional mechanisms connected with elec-tron–phonon interaction. These mechanisms arise in the attractive-U Hubbard model with static onsite or intersite attractive potential or in more realistic theories (which include retardation effects) such as Migdal– Eliashberg strong coupling theory or even Fermi–Bose mixture theory of Ranninger et al. and its generalizations. © E.D.

This research is based on an analysis of regulatory documents emerging from the automated system that tracks State Duma legislative activity and the online reference system 'Consultant+'. This analysis includes not only the adopted laws and regulations, but also the legislative proposals. An assessment of the dynamics of a variety of abortion indicators was carried out on the basis of the official statistics of Rosstat and the Russian Federation Ministry of Health. Based on changes in government policy, the authors distinguish three distinct periods in this process: firstly, the relatively positive trends in existence up to 1998; secondly, mildly unfavorable ones from 1998-2006; and, finally, the shift towards the archaic from 2006. The total numbers of abortions and more specific rates have been steadily declining since the late 1980s, even if the rates of this decline may vary. Two periods of rapid decrease in abortions are separated by a period of relatively slow decrease. The periods of the fastest decrease are characterized by contradictory policies and rhetoric. The authors conclude that population behavior in this area is independent of the controlling efforts of policy makers and that the abortion rate depends on the availability of and access to high-quality modern contraception. It is worth noting that the most radical measures that would sharply restrict the right to abortion have not yet been adopted. In conclusion, the authors provide a qualitative forecast of possible political changes and scenarios of population response to these changes. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.","Abortion; Birth Control; Contraception; Family Planning; Population Policy; Pregnancy Termination; Reproductive Health",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009111593

It is important to mention that we are examining these phenomena under conditions where civil society is under some degree of pressure from the Russian government, which prefers to view these organizations mainly as social service providers and assistants of the state. We view these organizations as interest groups because they unite ordinary citizens sharing a common identity and a willingness to pursue perceived common interests, which is achieved, among other things, by bargaining and making deals with politicians. Concepts of brokering and clientelism are applied to the study of veterans' organisations in Saint Petersburg and the Republic of Karelia. In providing mediation between ordinary people and politicians, brokers regulate the exchange of resources between them. On one hand, politicians obtain information about the needs and interests of a given interest group. On the other hand, citizens obtain personal rewards, such as support in defending social rights and acquiring social benefits from the government. In return, politicians can expect electoral support. Existence of this type of patronage exchange is usually taken as evidence that a political machine is active within a given community. Employing 'political machinery' as a theoretical framework revealed much about the specific role brokers have as moderators between ordinary people and politicians. The empirical analysis of this article is framed by comparative study of two cases that demonstrate how political and socio-economic contexts can account for the evolution of patronage exchange. While in St. Petersburg personal rewards are flourishing, in the Republic of Karelia such things are increasingly a thing of the past. Generally speaking, the empirical evidence of this study demonstrates the importance of patronage networks in framing social policy at the sub-national level in Russia. © The Journal of Social Policy Studies.","Clientelism; Social Policy; Veterans' Organizations",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009083905

For example, in the domain of animals, an expert may expect that the rule “mammal implies do not lay eggs” holds, while this may not be the case if the platypus is among the objects in the formal context. In this paper, we propose to bridge the possible gap between the representation model based on a concept lattice and the representation model of a domain expert. The knowledge of the expert is encoded as a set of attribute dependencies or constraints which is “aligned” with the set of implications provided by the concept lattice, leading to modifications in the original concept lattice. The method can be generalized for generating lattices satisfying constraints based on attribute dependencies and using extensional projections.

Indigenous peoples settled over 10,000 years ago in diverse ecological zones, giving rise to distinct cultural zones that still persist. Around 500 years ago, Europeans arrived, followed by Africans, Asians and South Americans. As a result of contact among these groups, many acculturation phenomena have a long history in Canada. For over 50 years, acculturation research has examined the adaptation of Aboriginal peoples, immigrants, refugees, and established ethnocultural groups. In this chapter, we first examine aspects of Canada's sociohistorical context, and some public policy responses to this context. We then present a selective overview of acculturation research in Canada. The Canadian context History of settlement Canada has become a diverse and pluralistic modern society. When European explorers arrived on the east coast of Canada in the 1500s, they found a land populated by around half a million Aboriginal peoples living throughout the territory that is now Canada. As the population of French and British colonialists grew, settlers expanded westward and northward. Following the American Revolution of 1776, those loyal to Britain fled from the United States of America and settled in eastern and southern Canada. The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw a continuing flow of British immigrants, as well as Ukrainian, Chinese, Italian and Irish settlers. In the early twentieth century, many eastern and southern Europeans came to farm in the Canadian prairies. Between 1946 and 1954, 96 percent of the immigrants came from Europe. Since the 1980s, the majority of immigrants have come from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. Due to this shift, “visible minorities” (those not of European descent) accounted for 19 percent of the population in 2011, making Canada even more diverse. The uptake of citizenship among immigrants is high: about 6 million foreign-born people in Canada were eligible to acquire citizenship; of these, just over 5 million (86 percent) had acquired Canadian citizenship, and Canadian national identity has remained strong (Cameron & Berry, 2011). Demography Canada is a federal state consisting of ten provinces and three territories. It has a total area of almost 10 million square kilometers, with over 90 percent of the Canadian population of just over 35 million living within 200 kilometers of the Canada–US border. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006627228

The quality of inferences based on our studies can be bolstered by using adequate, up-to-date methods. The present chapter deals with two methodological issues: the design of acculturation studies and procedures to assess acculturation. A leading theme of this chapter is that a careful choice of methodological aspects of a study, such as study and instrument design, can go a long way to enhancing the quality of acculturation studies. Both the design and assessment issues are core topics in cross-cultural psychology. However, we do not discuss this more general methodological literature or specific assessment instruments here. These issues are addressed elsewhere: for the design of cross-cultural studies, see Van de Vijver (2015) and Van de Vijver and Leung (1997); for test adaptations and translations, see Hambleton, Merenda, and Spielberger (2005); for the increasingly popular combination of qualitative and quantitative procedures, known as mixed methods, see Tashakkori and Teddlie, (2003); for overviews of acculturation measures, see Berry, Trimble, and Olmedo (1986), Celenk and Van de Vijver (2011, 2014), Matsudaira (2006), and Rudmin (2009). In the last 30 years, acculturation research has diversified. The prototypical acculturation study examined a single ethnic group that had moved to another country. This type of study is nowadays only one of the many kinds reported in the literature. As noted in Chapter 2, the diversification of the field has added to the complexity of the issues to be addressed in the field. For example, the terms that were used previously have become less adequate; hence we provide here a note on the terminology to clarify our use of terms (see Figure 2.2 for a description of the various kinds of acculturating groups). First, the term mainstream culture refers to the culture of the dominant group(s) in a society. In one kind of society, there is clearly one such group (e.g., Germans in Germany). In many other countries the context of acculturation may be ethnically diverse (e.g., in societies where many groups have come to live together, labeled super-diversity; Vertovec, 2007); an example is London, which used the slogan the “world in one city” in the 2012 Olympics bid to indicate that every nation of the world is represented in the population of London. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006591870

It is highly important for legitimization of the political regime as an ""explanation"" of continuity between collective past, present and future. The research is based on the theoretical frame that conceptualizes a historical component of identity politics and reveals factors that influence its structure in the contemporary Russian context. The author argues that there were two large periods in the development of the official narrative based on different conceptions - that of ""the new Russia"" and of ""the thousand-years-long Russia"". These periods roughly coincide with presidency of Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin - Dmitry Medvedev. The construction of the new narrative maintaining the Russian identity was complicated by a necessity to match two principally different cultural models of political work at the past - that of ""coping with a difficult past/collective trauma"" and aimed at consolidation of the nation/nation-building. There were different approaches to this political task in different periods. In the 1990s the official narrative had integrated discourse about ""trauma and crime"" as a part of legitimization of the post- Soviet transformation, but it could not manage to consolidate the nation. In the 2000s the choice was made for apologetic principle of work with collective past which resulted in the eclectic construction that marginalizes the topic of ""trauma and crime"". In the 2010s we can see some attempts to make the official narrative more consistent which bring ambivalent results. On the one hand, in the context of the current international conflict the apologetic conception of the national past is securitized as a ""weapon"" against the foreign and domestic enemies. On the other hand, a new round of discussions about the national history opens some windows of opportunities for actors struggling for ""coping with difficult past"" agenda.","Collective memory; Governing elite; Identity policy; Identity politics; Macro political (national) identity; Memory politics; Myth; Official historical narrative; Symbolic politics; Usable past",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85003671153

This is largely due to the lack of incentives for researchers. Article describes stimulation of researchers in Russia, compares it with foreign models, formulates main shortcomings of support and stimulation of research in Russia and introduces the concept of effective contract. Aims: Development of personnel motivation and stimulation of employees of scientific and research organizations in the field of health. Materials and methods: As a successful experience the article describes the implementation of effective contract in Veltishev Research and Clinical Institute for Pediatrics where for years remuneration of researchers depended upon their positions without consideration of research results. Effective contract brought significant changes in the traditional system setting new performance and efficiency criteria. New evaluation system took into account publication activity, presentation activity, implementation of research results, raising scientific personnel, thesis work and income-generating activities. Results: Introduction of effective contract already in the second year led to a rise in the number of foreign publications, publications in journals with impact factor of more than 2, the general increase in the number of articles in peer-reviewed journals with impact factor more than 0.3, the growth of the number of articles by 1 researcher, Hirsch index improving both by individual employees and the entire Institute, increase of grant activity and presentation activity at top-rated professional congresses. The growth of publication and presentation activities has been achieved at the reduction of research staff by 23%. From financial viewpoint effective contract resulted in the redistribution of resources in favour of more efficient researchers. Conclusions: The introduction of effective contract and increase of requirements for scientific output did not cause resistance of staff, although demanded certain time for joint development of criteria by scientific community, as well as the development and implementation of soft for continuous assessment of research activity.","Biomedical research; Compensation; Effective contract; Payment method","human; journal impact factor; medical research; organization and management; procedures; publication; publishing; Russian Federation; standards; total quality management; Biomedical Research; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Periodicals as Topic; Publishing; Quality Improvement; Russia","Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002711120

The former claims that translation is impossible as each language interprets reality in its own way and each linguistic community perceives the world in its own particular way. The latter approaches untranslatability as a more specific problem-the one which arises due to the existence of certain ""gaps"" between the source language (SL) and the target language (TL), but is somehow solved in each case. The article discusses a particular case of untranslatability-the rendering of the SL nonce words (or occasional words). They are created ad hoc and characterized by the entirety of the conventional and the individual, the stereotype and creativity as well as the author's linguistic and extralinguistic background. Nonce words do not have fixed translation equivalents, thus forcing the translator to make a specific translation decision each time s/he encounters a nonce word in the SL text. The translation decision depends on the understanding of the SL text, which, in the case of nonce words, can be a challenge for the translator. The context helps to overcome the problem of understanding but the context only is not enough when the text is ""linguistically preconditioned"". An example of a linguistically preconditioned text is Ulysses written by J. Joyce. We argue that it is the world building pattern (model) that fosters the understanding of the SL nonce words and helps the translator to make a translation decision. The statistical analysis shows that J. Joyce's nonce words are mainly formed by conventional word buildings patterns, with composition being the most frequently used model (61 %) and affixation and conversion being used less often (16 % and 3 % respectively). The comparative analysis of J. Joyce's nonce lexis and its Russian and German translation equivalents demonstrates that the translators tend to use the replication of the word building pattern as a prevalent translation method (70 % and 50 % for German and Russian translations respectively). Transliteration/transcription (16 % and 7 % for German and Russian translations respectively), omission (1 % and 3 %) and transformation (3 % and 18 %) as well as the usage of conventional TL lexis (10 % and 25 %) are the methods which are less regularly used to render J. Joyce's nonce words. This data indicates that the German language is more likely to allow the translator to replicate the form of an English nonce word. It results from the close genetic relationship between English and German. Overall, the research findings indicate that even intrinsically ""untranslatable"" units (such as nonce words) can be translated. Yet, the problem of translatability cannot be fully solved as nonce words have neither a conventional form nor a conventional meaning.","Lexical void; Nonce words; Translatability; Translation; Word building pattern; Word creation",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992695214

Previously we have demonstrated that the presence of words in large letter arrays does not affect the efficiency of visual search for a target letter in these arrays. The current study shows that spontaneous word extraction during visual search for target letters and controlled word extraction during visual search for words are mediated by different perceptual strategies. Spontaneous word detection is not accompanied by specific eye movements, whereas the words search task produces an increase of the number of eye fixations over all the letter array, both within and between words. In an additional study we demonstrate that categorical set does not affect the efficiency of visual search for words in random letter arrays: it seems that observers first extract words from letter arrays and then categorize detected words. Thus, there appears to exist two distinct mechanisms providing for the detection of words in letter arrays. The first mechanism is based on the processing of separate letters, whereas the second one is based on the processing of words as perceptual chunks.","Eye movements; Muensterberg's test; Perceptual strategies; Perceptual task; Visual search; Word superiority effect",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992529407

This problem is one of the key topics in the cultural sociology of the collective monography Anthropology of Protest, written about the popular protest in Russia in 2011-2012. In the Anthropology of Protest, protest rallies are described as a nexus of communication between protesters and the government (macro-level communication), and among protesters (local level communication). The authors focus on the analysis of the protest rallies' slogans and statements as seen on placards and banners. Special issues in the Anthropology of Protest are the role of language games in protest statements, and the effect of the local (topographic, etc.) context of small protest rallies on the form and content of protest statement (in the cases of Occupy Abay, toy ""nano-rallies"", and others). The Anthropology of Protest provokes cultural sociologists to more actively discuss the nature of moral classification, as well as the role and impact of the media. The Yale school of cultural sociology realizes moral classification rather in a structuralist style than as a tool of plain binary oppositions. The revised study describes moral classifications as complex non-linear phenomenon with condensation (Verdichtung), displacement (Verschiebung), or other types of effects which are characteristic of language games. The role of the mass media was described by J. Alexander (in the case of the Watergate affair) through the Durkheimian model of collective ritual.

Based on the analysis of social discourse, we have created a pool of items and undertaken three empirical studies aimed to develop and validate the Russian Attitudes to Homosexuals Inventory (RAHI) and investigate the associations of homophobic attitudes with a range of demographic and psychological variables. In Study 1 we used an online sample (N = 1,007) and explored the structure of the item pool, finding 8 factors, 5 of which referred to different dimensions of perceived threat of homosexuals (to individuals, morals, society, Russian culture, and heterosexual lifestyle) and 3 described social strategies directed at homosexuals (criminal punishment, medical treatment, and discrimination vs. protection). The scales were highly reliable (SOH = .82-.91) and formed a single second-order dimension, labelled general index of homophobia. Negative attitudes to homosexuals were stronger in males, religious respondents, and those heterosexuals who denied having experienced any feelings of same-sex attraction in their life. In Study 2 (paper-based sample, N = 292) we cross-validated the second-order structure of the RAHI. Using hierarchical multiple regression we found that homophobia was positively predicted by authoritarianism and negatively predicted by experience of same-sex attraction and social contact with homosexuals as friends. We also found weaker positive associations of homophobia with religiosity, social identification with gender, masculinity, extraversion, and social desirability, as well as a negative association with openness. In Study 3 we used contrast groups of neutral and anti-homosexual online community members (N = 330 and N = 107) to check the criterion validity of the RAHI. The findings are in line with the existing body of research from other countries, but reveal the culturally-specific features of the content of Russian homophobia (e.g., homosexuality is viewed as a result of Western influence). The RAHI emerged as a valid and reliable tool, which can be used for future Russian-language studies.","Attitudes to homosexuality; Authoritarian personality; Homo-negativity; Homosexual prejudice; Perceived threat of homosexuals",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989160307

This approach to social stratification results into the idea of social milieus more flexible than the picture provided by rigid class categorisations. Social milieus differ in many respects; we argue that they also differ in their media diets. In the 21st century, Russia is a fundamentally fragmented society with post-industrial, industrial, rural and migrant communities showing divergent relations to state social policies as well as varying patterns of public deliberation and consumption, including media use. Social fragmentation is, thus, mirrored in the fragmentation of the media systems; moreover, one more dimension, namely media hybridisation, intervenes and influences the formation of closed-up communicative milieus based on both social patterns and digital divide. Of the several societal milieus observed by social scientists in Russia, some are seriously under-represented in the media system; and deep differences in media consumption, agenda setting, and public deliberation exist between all of them. Recently, a major value-based societal cleavage was revealed during the 2011-2012 protest rallies within the ""For fair elections/white-ribbon"" movement. Our research in to the media consumption patterns of the participants shows a correlation between media usepatterns in the post-industrial urban ""public counter-sphere"" (consisting of the intelligentsia, the ""creative class"", students and other white-collar workers) and their perceived political freedom and self-reported online political behaviour. The research is expanded throughsearches for echo chambers and/or opinion crossroads in Russian Facebook vs. its Russian analogue Vkontakte. Results of an online survey with participants of the protest rallies (N=652), 11 in-depth interviews and 5 expert interviews were used to interpret the relations between self-reported media consumption dynamics and perceived political behaviour. The results show that the media diet of protest participants indicates a strong preference for several media clusters, especially social media, oppositional, and alternative-agenda media, while the consumption of traditional media and video is either plummeting or irrelevant. Facebook is flagged up as an echo chamber facilitating the protests.","Echo chambers; Facebook; Hybrid media system; Media use; Protest; Public sphere; Russia",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988637639

Our model for the identification of priorities is based on Russia's socio-economic development goals, and takes into account the impact of different scientific and technological development scenarios on the implementation of models of socio-economic arrangement. Based on this logic, a group of technological priorities unchanged in face of the wider spectrum of national economic and social goals is suggested. Global economic, social, and scientific-technological trends and their Russian projections are taken as exogenous factors for selecting technological priorities. The suggested approach is based on the assumption that a new system of priorities should ensure support for implementing strategic development goals and tasks in the medium- and long term, and aims to help define these goals and tasks more accurately. As a result, the paper identifies two groups of priorities. The first group outlines the already institutionalized areas of technological development while the second group outlines fields for institutionalization in the near future.

This concept describes a fundamental and manifold phenomena that needs to be specified and classified. The author argues that a solution of theoretical issues about the figure of the Other lays in the field of empirical research. In particular, the issue of ""significance"" of the Other for constituting the Self could be decided only on the basis of systematic study of social practices that essentially rely on (co)relation with particular out-groups. Political rhetoric could be a good field for study of symbolic functions of the Other and factors that determine its significance. Shared representations of the Other are not only an important element of identity construction but also an instrument of the symbolic politics, i.e. public activity aimed at production and dissemination / intrusion of competing visions of social reality. The article demonstrates how a study of patterns of representation of particular macro political communities allows to assess their relative ""significance"". Basing on theoretical insights from the literature the author proposes a research method that includes manual coding of the frames of representation of the Other in the context of legitimization of political course with subsequent counting of their frequency added by discourse analysis of each group of frames. This method is tried on the case of comparative analysis of frames of representation of the American and Chinese Others in the rhetoric of the presidents of the Russian Federation (from 2000 to 2015).","Frame; Image of China; Image of the USA; Macro political identity; Mixed methods; Political rhetoric; Significant Other; Symbolic politics",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986617569

The first (after 1919) phase transition of this sort occurred in the early 1960s and was related to the growth of global informational connectivity after the World War II, as well as the improvement of the means of protest self-organization due to the spread of television, portable radio receivers, portable electric loud-speakers and other technologies of the Fourth Kondratieff Cycle.

Similarly to what was observed during the Fourth Kondratieff Wave, during the Fifth Cycle while the spread of these technologies was going on for many years before 2011, their internal colossal potential for generating and spreading protest activity was realized in one leap.","Arab Spring; Gartner hype-cycles; Kondratieff cycles; Mass media; New media; North Africa; Phase transition; Protest activity; Sociopolitical destabilization; The Middle East",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986575802

The subject matter of the research is FDI to the regions of Russia. The subject of the study is relevant as it makes possible to estimate the long-term consequences from the restrictions of the West countries (in connection with sanctions) against the inflow of the foreign capital to the regions of the Russian Federation. The study is based on the following hypotheses: 1. Russian regional economy has horizontal (distribution of effects from FDI within an industry) and vertical spillover effects (distribution according to a technological chain, from product suppliers to product consumers). Vertical effects are more important and have greater amplitude than horizontal effects. An industry competition is one of the causes of negative horizontal spillover effect, and the scale of the company is the reason of positive horizontal spillover effect. 2. FDI generates the positive regional spillover effects on the productivity of domestic firms in the Russian economy. 3. Regional industry specificity influences the sign and magnitude of spillovers from FDI. 4. Time sensitivity is revealed for horizontal spillovers, so the regional effects may change the direction. As an empirical basis of the study, the statements of 23567 Russian companies with FDI and 25354 Russian enterprises without FDI for the 5 years were used. The methodology of the research is the calculation of spillover effects, Cobb-Douglas production function and panel data regression. The study has found, that the direct vertical spillover effects are almost absent. That means that industrial consumers do not notice the effect of inward FDI. At the same time, the converse effect related to the product suppliers is positive, but as the direct effect, it is not more important in any group of regions then the horizontal effect. The Russian economy has a positive regional spillover effect of FDI. The positive effect of FDI for a region of investment attractiveness, first of all, extends to regions with similar investment climate, and after that residually extends to less successful regions. The regional spillover effect is unstable and has high volatility. Therefore, regional administration has to develop the anti-crisis policy and try to improve the investment climate. The findings of the study may be useful for the regional authorities to formulate the investment policy.","Economic and mathematical modeling; Empirical analysis; Foreign direct investment; Horizontal spillovers; Investment; Region spillovers; Spillover effect; Vertical spillovers",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979961834

On the other side, kernel smoothing is a well established, well understood and successful approach in nonparametric estimation, in particular in the time varying coefficient model. But not much has been done for kernel smoothing in high-dimensional models. In this paper we will close this gap and we develop a penalized kernel smoothing approach for sparse high-dimensional models. The proposed estimators make use of a novel penalization scheme working with kernel smoothing. We establish a general and systematic theoretical analysis in high dimensions. This complements recent alternative approaches that are based on basis approximations and that allow more direct arguments to carry over insights from high-dimensional linear models. Furthermore, we develop theory not only for regression with independent observations but also for local stationary time series in high-dimensional sparse varying coefficient models. The development of theory for local stationary processes in a high-dimensional setting creates technical challenges. We also address issues of numerical implementation and of data adaptive selection of tuning parameters for penalization. The finite sample performance of the proposed methods is studied by simulations and it is illustrated by an empirical analysis of NASDAQ composite index data. © 2016, Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

Despite evidence of the second demographic transition in Israel, total fertility has not declined during the last three decades, unlike in most western high-income democracies. Two alternative explanations in the literature address this phenomenon. One is religiosity and the other is a nationalist sentiment at the aggregate level – both driving the high fertility rates. Using structural equation modelling, the current study tests the association of each of these two factors with fertility. Religiosity and nationalism were constructed as latent variables based on individual-level observed measures. Supporting previous studies at the aggregate level, the current analysis confirms that religiosity is the main determinant of fertility at the individual level, whereas nationalism has an effect on fertility only due to its high connection with religiosity. Parsimonious and comprehensive models of Jewish fertility in Israel and further research directions are suggested. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","fertility; Israel; nationalism; religiosity; structural equation modelling",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963553766

That problem consisted in the decomposition of a certain 4-parameter family of unitary representations, which replace the nonexisting two-sided regular representation (Olshanski [31]). The required decomposition is governed by certain probability measures on an infinite-dimensional space Ω, which is a dual object to U(∞). A way to describe those measures is to convert them into determinantal point processes on the real line; it turned out that their correlation kernels are computable in explicit form - they admit a closed expression in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function F12 (Borodin and Olshanski [8]).In the present work we describe a (nonevident) q-discretization of the whole construction. This leads us to a new family of determinantal point processes. We reveal its connection with an exotic finite system of q-discrete orthogonal polynomials - the so-called pseudo big q-Jacobi polynomials. The new point processes live on a double q-lattice and we show that their correlation kernels are expressed through the basic hypergeometric function ϕ12.A crucial novel ingredient of our approach is an extended version G of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph (the conventional graph describes the Gelfand-Tsetlin branching rule for irreducible representations of unitary groups). We find the q-boundary of G, thus extending previously known results (Gorin [17]). © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Determinantal measures; Gelfand-Tsetlin graph; Noncommutative harmonic analysis",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947017194

At the same time, about two thirds of the surveyed companies are significantly dependent on imports, primarily imports of machinery and equipment. The main reason for the use of imports is the absence of Russian analogues. If they are present, there are problems with the low quality of those Russian analogues and the fact that they are not in line with the client's technological requirements.

However, in the absence of close work with the horizontal measures, such as the development of certain critical technologies, the formation of new areas of knowledge and filling previously missing science competences, such a policy is characterized by a 'limited shelf life', constant lag, with a focus primarily on the price competitiveness.

We test the presence of various types of warfare (such as conquest warfare, land acquisition warfare, and plunder warfare) in societies with different degrees of political centralization. Quantitative cross-cultural tests reveal a rather strong correlation between political complexity and the presence of conquest warfare suggesting that conquest warfare was virtually absent among independent communities. Newer works by Carneiro propose a model explaining how simple chiefdoms could appear in the absence of conquest warfare.

The findings reveal that changes in public perceptions of poverty and inequality in Russia largely mirror the actual trends pertaining to these phenomena. Although decreasing poverty, and its changing causes, has made the problem itself of lesser concern to Russians, the diminishing concern about poverty has been replaced by growing concern regarding increasing inequalities. Russians increasingly stigmatize the poor, which can be explained by the fact that poverty had become mostly a marginal phenomenon by 2014 and that Russians became less prone to perceive poverty as being caused by structural factors. On the other hand, they still recognize that particular circumstances may lead to poverty. As a result their perceptions become more individualized. Therefore, to address the problems of the poor, Russians increasingly demand a more differentiated policy which would alleviate these circumstances. Further, Russians have a clear understanding of the 'poverty threshold', i.e. the minimum subsistence income and particular characteristics of poverty such as malnutrition, the lack of money to buy clothes and to satisfy other basic needs without going into debt. This understanding is stable and therefore it has become more relevant to define poverty as relative deprivation. The findings also reveal that Russians are highly tolerant of the social inequality caused by the factors assumed to be legitimate in the paradigm of equal opportunities. The current level of inequality, however, is perceived as highly excessive and is more often attributed to illegitimate factors. This pushes the demand for redistributive policies. The article concludes by outlining the more specific contours of a social policy which would correspond to the current structure of preferences. Such a policy implies not so much a monetary means of support, but a further improvement of institutions which enable legitimate ways of individual attainment, a reduction in the factors leading to poverty, and equal opportunities for everyone.","Inequality; Poverty; Public opinion; Social justice; Social structure; Tunnel effect",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85001955442

The general design of new prospects opens at a stage of the birth of evolutionary processes, their forecasting requires the analysis of the historical prerequisites and risks, which are closely integrated to the change of moods in society. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the newly independent states have passed the transformational and evolutional stage of development from the regional economy (they actually were the regions) to the economy of the state; the Central and Eastern European countries have experienced a dramatic ""drift"" to the European Union. In the article, the results of almost 25 years' transformation of these states are considered. New states, formed as a result of the collapse of the USSR, passed throughout three types of transformation. Firstly, it is the transformation at the ideological level. The transformation of the second type was purely economic. The third type can be characterized as the institutional (including structural and financial) transformation. It is shown that one of the important reasons for the modest economic performance in the post-Soviet space is that newly independent states ignore and do not use in the practice the principles of regional policy and regional modernization. One of the important characteristic of the social and economic evolution of the countries of Eastern Europe after 1990 became the process of stratification and social differentiation of society with an insufficiently strong middle class and the polarization in income levels between the different regions. The increasing polarization in the income levels of the various regions acts as the dominating trend of the growing economic inequality.","Clustering; Economic inequality; Economic transformation; Institutional reforms; Integrated modernization; Middle class; New states; Regional development; Social differentiation",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992151533

Methods: The study tested the level of income, employment, education and alcohol consumption on the basis of the survey and analyzed the data of the official statistics. We used Statistica v.12 and IBM SPSS Statistics v.22 for calculating the chi-square, Wilcoxon signed- rank test criteria, T-test for paired samples and made regression and correlation analysis. Results: We did not discover significant differences in income levels, unemployment and alcohol consumption in the cohort study (2001-2010) of indigenous population in Chukotka Autonomous Region. In addition, the income of the natives is still low, unemployment and alcohol consumption are high. There is a correlation between the socioeconomic and behavioral factors and health indicators. We also propose a mathematical model which allows to suggest that the level of income above the subsistence level in 6-7 times is sufficient to minimize the impact of socioeconomic factors on population health. Conclusion: In order to prevent irreversible process of indigenous population health deterioration and society degradation it is necessary to create the accessible vocational education, increase employment and number of leisure centers.

The method can be generalized for generating lattices satisfying constraints based on attribute dependencies and using extensional projections. This method also allows the experts to keep a trace of the changes occurring in the original lattice and the revised version, and to assess how concepts in practice are related to concepts automatically issued from data.","Attribute dependency; Attribute implication; Formal concept analysis; Projection","Information analysis; Attribute dependency; Attribute implications; Concept Lattices; Domain experts; Domain knowledge models; Formal contexts; Projection; Representation model; Formal concept analysis","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983401018

The purpose of this study was to determine differences in the brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in male subjects in evaluating an intensity of pleasant images, including erotic, or unpleasant and neutral pictures. When comparing the condition with evaluation of the pleasant erotic images with conditions containing neutral or unpleasant stimuli, a significant activation was observed in the posterior cingulate cortex, the prefrontal cortex and the right globus pallidus. An increased activity of the right anterior central gyrus was observed in the conditions related to evaluation of pleasant and neutral stimuli. Thus, in the process of evaluating the intensity of emotional images of an erotic nature the active brain areas were related not only to neuronal representations of emotions, but also to motivations and control system of emotional arousal, which should be taken into account while using erotic pictures as intensive positive emotional stimuli.","Emotions; Fmri; Motivation; Reward; Sexual arousal","aged; arousal; brain; brain mapping; emotion; erotica; human; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; photostimulation; physiology; prefrontal cortex; radiography; reward; Aged; Arousal; Brain; Brain Mapping; Emotions; Erotica; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Photic Stimulation; Prefrontal Cortex; Reward","Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975041762

Model I is the classical Cramér–Lundberg risk model with an exponential claim size distribution. Model II is a modification of the classical risk model (risk process with stochastic premiums) with exponential distributions of claim and premium sizes. For the survival probability of an insurance company over infinite time (as a function of its initial surplus), there arise singular problems for second-order linear integrodifferential equations (IDEs) defined on a semiinfinite interval and having nonintegrable singularities at zero: model I leads to a singular constrained initial value problem for an IDE with a Volterra integral operator, while II model leads to a more complicated nonlocal constrained problem for an IDE with a non-Volterra integral operator. A brief overview of previous results for these two problems depending on several positive parameters is given, and new results are presented. Additional results are concerned with the formulation, analysis, and numerical study of “degenerate” problems for both models, i.e., problems in which some of the IDE parameters vanish; moreover, passages to the limit with respect to the parameters through which we proceed from the original problems to the degenerate ones are singular for small and/or large argument values. Such problems are of mathematical and practical interest in themselves.

With use of the virological method and the method of enzyme immunoassay (EIA), there were examined 934 drinking water samples from the public drinking water supply system, and with use of the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) - 617 water samples. Presence of enteroviruses and their genetic material in drinking water samples was confirmed in the laboratory in 2008, 2010 and 2014. In what connection, the proportion of samples with positive research results for enteroviruses with use of the PCR method was in 2008-4.5 %, in 2010-7.4 %, in 2014-1.6 %. In the analysis with use of the virological method, a positive result was received in 2010 - there were isolated 3 strains of Coxsackie enteroviruses B5 (2.4 %) and in 2014 - there was isolated 1 strain of Coxsackie enteroviruses B3 (0.5 %). The results of the analysis of water samples carried out with use of the EIA method with the goal to reveal hepatitis A virus and rotaviruses antigens have shown annually registered facts of presence of markers of these causative agents in piped water.

All active schedules, which constitute a subset of feasible schedules including the optimal, can be generated by the constructive algorithm. To obtain improved solutions, iterated local search (ILS) is applied to the chromosomes at the end of each reproduction process.

Different senses normally have different frequencies in corpora. We introduced several techniques for determining sense frequency based on dictionary entries matched with data from large corpora. Information about word sense frequency is not only useful for explanatory lexicography and WSD, but it also may enrich language learning resources. Learners of a foreign language who encounter a word similar to one of their native language are often tempted to assume that the foreign word and its equivalent have the same meaning structure. Sometimes, however, this is not the case, and the most frequent sense of a word in one language may be much less frequent for its cognate. We proposed a method for detecting such cases. Having selected a set of Russian words included into the Active Dictionary of Russian which have more than two dictionary senses and have cognates in English, we estimated the frequencies for English and Russian senses using SemCor and Russian National Corpus respectively, matched the senses in each pair of words and compared their frequencies. Thus we revealed cases in which the most frequent senses and whole meaning structures are, cross-linguistically, substantially different and studied them in more detail. This technique can be applied not only to cognates, but also to pairs of words which are usually offered by the dictionaries as the translation equivalents of each other.","Experiments; Frequency; Lexicography; Meaning frequency; Polysemy; Semantics; Statistical techniques; Text corpora",,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020407067

We review the key achievements of the quasi-adiabatic theory, which provided insight into the fine structure of thin current sheets and enabled a comparison with experiment. This comparison showed the quasi-adiabatic approach to be more effective than the classical MHD approximation. With the development of the quasi-adiabatic theory in the last two decades, the existence of a number of new thin current sheet features, such as multi-scaling, metastability, and embedding, has been predicted and subsequently confirmed in situ; the role of individual particle populations in the formation of the current sheet fine structure has also been investigated. The role of nonadiabatic effects in accelerating plasma beamlets interacting with current sheets is examined. Asymmetry mechanisms in thin current sheets in the presence of a magnetic shear component are described. A study is carried out of current sheet self-organization processes leading to the formation of a shear magnetic component consistent with currents flowing in the plasma. It is demonstrated that the ongoing development of the theory of thin current structures is a logical continuation of Syrovatskii's and Ginzburg's ideas on cosmic rays and reconnected current sheets in the solar corona. © 2016 Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk, Russian Academy of Sciences.","Acceleration and scattering of plasma particles; Beamlets; Collisionless space plasma; Quasi-adiabatic theory; Thin current sheets","Atomic physics; Collisionless plasmas; Cosmology; Magnetoplasma; Adiabatic theory; Beamlets; Plasma particles; Space plasmas; Thin current sheet; Shear flow","English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85012979727

This has resulted in widening of inter-country disparities in life expectancy. Moreover, the pattern of divergence appears to be driven in part by processes at the level of country groupings defined in geopolitical terms. A systematic quantitative analysis of this phenomenon has not been possible using demographic decomposition approaches as these have not been suitably adapted for this purpose. In this paper we present an elaboration of conventional decomposition techniques to provide a toolkit for analysis of the inter-country variance, and illustrate its use by analyzing trends in life expectancy in developed countries over a 40-year period. Methods: We analyze trends in the population-weighted variance of life expectancy at birth across 36 developed countries and three country groups over the period 1970-2010. We have modified existing decomposition approaches using the stepwise replacement algorithm to compute age components of changes in the total variance as well as variance between and within groups of Established Market Economies (EME), Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and the Former Soviet Union (FSU). The method is generally applicable to the decomposition of temporal changes in any aggregate index based on a set of populations. Results: The divergence in life expectancy between developed countries has generally increased over the study period. This tendency dominated from the beginning of 1970s to the early 2000s, and reversed only after 2005. From 1970 to 2010, the total standard deviation of life expectancy increased from 2.0 to 5.6 years among men and from 1.0 to 3.6 years among women. This was determined by the between-group effects due to polarization between the EME and the FSU. The latter contrast was largely fueled by the long-term health crisis in Russia. With respect to age, the increase in the overall divergence was attributable to between-country differences in mortality changes at ages 15-64 years compared to those aged 65 and older. The within-group variance increased, especially among women. This change was mostly produced by growing mortality differences at ages 65 and older. Conclusions: From the early 1970s to the mid-2000s, the strong divergence in life expectancy across developed countries was largely determined by the between-group variance and mortality polarization linked to the East-West geopolitical division. © 2016 The Author(s).","Decomposition; Developed countries; East-West gap in life expectancy; Mortality disparities; Stepwise replacement algorithm","algorithm; birth rate; decomposition analysis; demographic trend; divergence; geopolitics; global perspective; life expectancy; longevity; mortality; adolescent; adult; age; aged; algorithm; Article; Australia; Austria; Belarus; Belgium; Bulgaria; Canada; Czech Republic; decomposition; Denmark; developed country; England; Estonia; female; Finland; France; German Democratic Republic; German Federal Republic; groups by age; human; Hungary; Iceland; Ireland; Italy; Japan; Latvia; life expectancy; Lithuania; longevity; Luxembourg; male; mortality; Netherlands; New Zealand; Northern Ireland; Norway; Poland; Portugal; priority journal; Russian Federation; Scotland; sex difference; Slovakia; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; trend study; Ukraine; United States; Wales; age distribution; comparative study; Europe; health; health disparity; life expectancy; longevity; middle aged; trends; USSR; very elderly; young adult; Central Europe; Eastern Europe; Russian Federation; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Developed Countries; Europe; Female; Health; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Life Expectancy; Longevity; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Russia; Sex Factors; United States; USSR; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991829615

We then consider mass problems of finding an approximate solution of halting problem and probabilistic algorithms for them, proving both positive and negative results.

We improve the OECD high-technology product classification by increasing the level of disaggregation, accounting for new goods, ensuring comparability over time, and differentiating goods by technological level on quite high levels of disaggregation. We describe the major trends in the world market for high-tech goods and identify the leading countries in each sector (most frequently, China, Germany, Republic of Korea, Switzerland, and Singapore) primarily by calculating net exports of high-tech goods in these sectors. We also assess Russian competitive positions in the global market for high-tech goods by sectors, applying the newly developed competitiveness index, and measure Russian dependence on high-tech goods imported from countries that recently imposed sanctions against Russia. We show that Russia's economy is highly dependent on imports of pharmaceutical goods and medical equipment, machinery and equipment (except nuclear reactors, fuel elements, engines and turbines), and electrical equipment. The sectors with most imports originating from 'sanction-imposing' countries are aircraft, medical and optical equipment, engines and turbines, and pharmaceutical goods.

The authors analyze effective normative legal acts in the spheres of counteracting corruption, terrorism, high treason and espionage. They offer a brief historic overview of key trends in crime counteraction since 1949, when the People’s Republic of China was founded. The methodology is aimed at solving the tasks of the study and includes comparative jurisprudence, systemic approach, formal legal, historical and statistical methods. After the introduction of the policy of «reform and opening-up», the Chinese society faced a sharp growth of crime, especially in the sphere of economy. The lawmakers did not have time to adopt the needed legal acts in the sphere of criminal law. The gaps were bridged by local documents aimed at toughening criminal liability measures for new types of crimes. After some significant changes were introduced in the Criminal Code of People’s Republic of China, crime counteraction acquired a more comprehensive character. Over time various normative legal acts, whose clauses refer to crime counteraction, have been adopted. The research results allow the authors to conclude that the government of the People’s Republic of China follows a tough criminal policy in the sphere of crime counteraction. Such an approach is justified and brings positive results.

In the current climate of sanctions between Russia and Western countries and limitations on international technology transfer, there is a growing need to analyse the factors influencing regional innovation. Previous empirical studies using a knowledge production function approach have found that the main factor of growth in regional innovation is increasing spending on research and development (R&D). Our econometric analyses show that the quality of human capital, a product of the number of economically active urban citizens with a higher education (the so-called creative class) has the greatest influence on the number of potentially commercializable patents. Other significant factors were buying equipment, which indicates a high rate of wear and tear of Russian machinery, and spending on basic research. The 'centre-periphery' structure of Russia's innovation system favours the migration of highly qualified researchers to leading regions, which weakens the potential of the 'donor regions'. However, at the same time, we see significantly fewer limitations on knowledge spillovers in the form of patents and - in this case - proximity to the 'centres' is a positive factor.","Creative class; Human capital; Knowledge production function; Knowledge spillovers; Patenting level; R&D; Regions of the Russian Federation",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021414150

A prevalent neural substrate of WM coding is persistent neural activity, the property of neurons to remain active after having been activated by a transient sensory stimulus. This persistent activity allows for online maintenance of memory as well as its active manipulation necessary for task performance. WM is tightly capacity limited. Therefore, selective gating of sensory and internally generated information is crucial for WM function. While the exact neural substrate of selective gating remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests that it might be controlled by modulating ongoing oscillatory brain activity. Here, we review experiments and models that linked selective gating, persistent activity, and brain oscillations, putting them in the more general mechanistic context of WM. We do so by defining several operations necessary for successful WM function and then discussing how such operations may be carried out by mechanisms suggested by computational models. We specifically show how oscillatory mechanisms may provide a rapid and flexible active gating mechanism for WM operations.","Neural networks; Neural oscillations; Persistent activity; Selective gating; Working memory",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015832059

Thus, the free material design can be formulated as an optimization problem. However, due to its large scale, second-order methods cannot solve the free material design problem in a reasonable time. We formulate the free material optimization (FMO) problem into a saddle-point form in which the inverse of the stiffness matrix A(E) in the constraint is eliminated. The size of A(E) is generally large, denoted as N × N. This is the first formulation of FMO without A(E)-1. We apply the primal-dual subgradient method [Y. Nesterov, Math. Program., 120 (2009), pp. 221-259] to solve the restricted saddle-point formula. This is the first gradient-Type method for FMO. Each iteration of our algorithm takes a total of O(N2) floating-point operations and an auxiliary vector storage of size O(N), compared with formulations having the inverse of A(E) which requires O(N3) arithmetic operations and an auxiliary vector storage of size O(N2). To solve the problem, we developed a closed-form solution to a semidefinite least squares problem and an efficient parameter update scheme for the gradient method. We also approximate a solution to the bounded Lagrangian dual problem. The problem is decomposed into small problems, each having only an unknown of k × k (k = 3 or 6) matrix, and can be solved in parallel. The iteration bound of our algorithm is optimal for a general subgradient scheme. Finally, we present promising numerical results. © 2016 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.","Complexity; Constrained least squares; Duality; Fast gradient method; First-order method; Free material optimization; Lagrangian; Large-scale problems; Nesterov's primal-dual subgradient method; Saddle-point","Constrained optimization; Digital arithmetic; Gradient methods; Iterative methods; Lagrange multipliers; Least squares approximations; Matrix algebra; Numerical analysis; Optimization; Problem solving; Stiffness matrix; Complexity; Constrained least squares; Duality; Fast gradient methods; First order method; Free material optimizations; Lagrangian; Large-scale problem; Saddle point; Sub-gradient methods; Inverse problems","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007240765

In 16% of cases, the downward negative leader connected to the upward positive leader below its tip (attached to the lateral surface of the positive leader), with the connection being accomplished via a channel segment that appeared to be perpendicular to one or both of the leader channels. © 2016.

Such deficit is a characteristic feature of so-called semantic aphasia. The impaired comprehension of semantically reversible constructions in those patients can be explained by a disorder of the common spatial neuropsychological factor grounded in the temporal-parietal-occipital (TPO) regions of the brain. Aims: The aim of the present study was to experimentally test the possibility that individuals with semantic aphasia experience specific difficulties in extracting spatial relations from a linguistic form and rely instead on basic sensorimotor stereotypes to interpret reversible linguistic constructions. Methods & Procedures: Six individuals with semantic aphasia, 12 people with motor aphasia, 12 people with sensory aphasia, and 12 non-brain-damaged individuals performed a sentence–picture matching task; all participants were native speakers of Russian. Two types of reversible sentences were tested, each representing a direct and an inverted word order: prepositional (The boy is putting the bag in the box vs. The boy is putting in the box the bag) and instrumental (The grandmother is covering the scarf with the hat vs. The grandmother is covering with the hat the scarf). Irreversible sentences (The boy is putting the apple in the bag) served as control stimuli. Outcomes & Results: Each group of participants performed better on irreversible than on reversible sentences. Within reversible sentences, an interaction between word order and construction type was found in individuals with semantic aphasia only. They performed more accurately in prepositional constructions with direct word order and in instrumental constructions with inverted word order—both are related to sensorimotor stereotypes reflecting interaction with objects in the real world. Although no such clear dissociation was found in other aphasia types, correlation analysis revealed the same effect in some participants with motor and sensory aphasia. Conclusions: The findings confirm the importance of situational context for linguistic processing. First, if knowledge of the real world supports the unique interpretation of grammatical markers, it enhances processing in all tested cohorts of participants. Second, people with semantic aphasia consistently use sensorimotor stereotypes to compensate for their linguistic deficits. Since this was also found in some participants with other aphasia types, such a sensorimotor strategy might depend not on the damage to TPO areas as such, but on the intactness and overuse of left premotor regions suggested to be critical for motor and symbolic sequential processing. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","reversible sentences; Russian language; semantic aphasia; sensorimotor stereotype; spatial relations","adult; aged; aphasia; Article; ataxic aphasia; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; correlation analysis; cortical sensory aphasia; disease severity; female; human; language ability; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; parieto-occipital sulcus; performance; psychologic test; reversible sentence; scoring system; semantic aphasia; semantic memory; sensorimotor function; sentence picture matching task; speech analysis; young adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945454976

Moreover, goals are often specified using explicit time constraints which must be satisfied by the system perpetually. For example, drones carrying out the surveillance of some area must always have recent pictures, i.e., at most M time units old, of some strategic locations. This paper proposes a Multiset Rewriting language with explicit time for specifying and analysing TSDSes.We introduce two properties, realizability (some trace is good) and survivability (where, in addition, all admissible traces are good). A good trace is an infinite trace in which goals are perpetually satisfied. We propose a class of systems called progressive timed systems (PTS), where intuitively only a finite number of actions can be carried out in a bounded time period. We prove that for this class of systems both the realizability and the survivability problems are PSPACE-complete. Furthermore, if we impose a bound on time (as in bounded model-checking), we show that for PTS, realizability becomes NP-complete, while survivability is in the Δp 2 class of the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate that the rewriting logic system Maude can be used to automate time bounded verification of PTS. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,"Drones; Time sharing systems; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Bounded model checking; Bounded verifications; Distributed systems; Environment interference; Multiset rewriting; Polynomial hierarchies; Strategic locations; Time constraints; Model checking","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984868364

Results of Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood analyses supported the monophyly of Onuphidae and its traditional subdivision into two monophyletic subfamilies: Onuphinae and Hyalinoeciinae. Ten of 22 recognized genera were monophyletic with strong node support; four more genera included in this study were either monotypic or represented by a single species. None of the genera appeared para- or polyphyletic and this indicates a strong congruence between the traditional morphology-based systematics of the family and the newly obtained molecular-based phylogenetic reconstructions. Intergeneric relationships within Hyalinoeciinae were not resolved. Two strongly supported monophyletic groups of genera were recovered within Onuphinae: ((Onuphis, Aponuphis), Diopatra, Paradiopatra) and (Hirsutonuphis, (Paxtonia, (Kinbergonuphis, Mooreonuphis))).

Demographic analysis suggests that the cohort fertility decline of the 1960s cohorts is likely to continue at least among the 1970s birth cohorts; stagnation cannot be ruled out. Births that were postponed by women born in the 1970s were not being replaced in sufficient numbers for cohort fertility to increase in the foreseeable future, and shares of low parity women (childless and one child) were larger than shares of high parity women among the late 1960s cohorts than in older cohorts. Also, childbearing postponement which started in the 1990s is reflected in dramatic changes of childbearing age patterns. As period fertility rates have been increasing in the late 2000s throughout the region an impression of a fertility recovery has been created, however the findings of this project indicate that no such widespread childbearing recovery is underway. For the first time ever an overview and analysis of CEE family policies is conceptualized in this paper. It demonstrates that fertility trends and family policies are a matter of serious concern throughout the region. The following family policy types have been identified: comprehensive family policy model; pro-natalist policies model; temporary male bread-winner model; and conventional family policies model. The majority of family policies in CEE countries suffer from a variety of shortcomings that impede them from generating enhanced family welfare and from providing conditions for cohort fertility to increase. The likely further decline of cohort fertility, or its stagnation, may entail long-term demographic as well as other societal consequences, such as continuous declines in total population numbers, changes in age structures, as well as implications for health and social security costs. © 2016, Bundesinstitut fur Bevolkerungsforschung.
