The oligarchic capitalism of the 1990s arose when a weak state was forced to seek the help of those with financial capital in exchange for political rights. Economic development in the 2000s, the budget surplus, and Putin's policies changed the situation: ""milking"" the country's budget and arranging ""payoffs"" became the main forms of informal cooperation between the government and business. However, the economic difficulties of the 2010s sharply aggravated competition for access to budget resources. Under the slogans of legalizing the economy and fighting corruption, the administration found new informal ways to manage and control big business, assigning the ""kings of government contracts"" to implement projects as a marker of loyalty to the President's administration and a precondition for continued business success. © 2018 Denver University Law Review.

This system was first reformed in the early 1990s and then again in the early 2000s. The analysis presented here fills a gap in the existing literature concerning the dynamic of change associated with Russian civil service reform (CSR). It is argued that the process of bureaucratic modernization in Russia is undermined by the ambivalent nature of policy leadership with its financial, administrative, and technical support, and the ongoing bargain among policy advocates and policy implementers. In order to account for the outcomes reached by policy-makers, the paper presents a detailed analysis of expert interviews collected by the author among research community specialists, federal legislators, and other participants in the reform. The discussion highlights the importance of power dynamics, which resolves conflicting views of CSR among policy formulators and policy implementers. The findings, which consist of identifying necessary and sufficient conditions of the change process, have implications for studies of modern Russian politics, states in regime transition, and world-wide modernization. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065024387

Mitochondria are important for intracellular calcium handling and signaling. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (mtCU) is a multiprotein complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane responsible for the transport of calcium to the mitochondrial matrix. In the present study, we analyzed the expression level of mtCU components in two parts of the feto-maternal system – placenta and myometrium at full-term delivery and at preterm birth (PTB) on different stages: 22–27, 28–32, 33–36 weeks of gestation (n = 50). A gradual increase of mRNA expression and changes in protein content of MCU and MICU1 subunits were revealed in the placenta during gestation. We also observed slower depolarization rate of isolated placental mitochondria induced by Ca2+ titration at PTB. In myometrium at PTB relative gene expression level of MCU, MCUb and SMDT1 increased as compared to full-term pregnancy, but the tendency to gradual increase of MCU protein simultaneous with MCUb increase and MICU1 decline was shown in gestational dynamics.

It is commonly accepted that it undergoes significant structural rearrangements on the lipid-water interface, thus acquiring membrane binding and penetration ability. In this study molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to explore large-scale conformational changes of the globular viscumin A chain in a complex environment – comprising urea and chloroform/methanol (CHCl 3 /MeOH) mixture. Being well-packed in aqueous solution, viscumin A undergoes global structural rearrangements in both organic media. In urea, the protein is “swelling” and gradually loses its long-distance contacts, thus resembling the “molten globule” state. In CHCl 3 /MeOH, viscumin A is in effect turned “inside out”. This is accompanied with strengthening of the secondary structure and surface exposure of hydrophobic epitopes originally buried inside the globule. Resulting solvent-adapted models were further subjected to Monte Carlo simulations with an implicit hydrophobic slab membrane. In contrast to only a few point surface contacts in water and two short regions with weak protein-lipid interactions in urea, MD-derived structures in CHCl 3 /MeOH reveal multiple determinants of membrane interaction. Consequently it is now possible to propose a specific pathway for the structural adaptation of viscumin A with respect to the cell membrane – a probable first step of its translocation into cytoplasmic targets. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060369197

We examined language outcomes in young adults and adolescents raised in institutions (n = 23) as compared to their socioeconomic status and age peers raised in biological families (n = 24) using a behavioral language assessment and linguistic event-related potentials (ERPs). Controlling for intelligence, adults with a history of institutionalization demonstrated deficits in lexical and grammatical development and spelling. Analyses of ERP data revealed significant group differences in the dynamic processing of linguistic stimuli. Adults with a history of institutionalization displayed reduced neural sensitivity to violations of word expectancy, leading to reduced condition effects for temporo-spatial factors that tentatively corresponded to the N200, P300/N400, and phonological mismatch negativity. The results suggest that language is a vulnerable domain in adults with a history of institutionalization, the deficits in which are not explained by general developmental delays, and point to the pivotal role of early linguistic environment in the development of the neural networks involved in language processing. © 2019, The Author(s).",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062868847

Here, we show that NL disruption in Drosophila S2 cells leads to chromatin compaction and repositioning from the nuclear envelope. This increases the chromatin density in a fraction of topologically-associating domains (TADs) enriched in active chromatin and enhances interactions between active and inactive chromatin. Importantly, upon NL disruption the NL-associated TADs become more acetylated at histone H3 and less compact, while background transcription is derepressed. Two-colour FISH confirms that a TAD becomes less compact following its release from the NL. Finally, polymer simulations show that chromatin binding to the NL can per se compact attached TADs.

The main focus is on the new insights gained from recent observations for 3 types of electric discharges: natural lightning (Nag et al., 2012; Tran and Rakov, 2017a,c), rocket-and-wire triggered lightning (Howard et al., 2010; Hill et al., 2016), and long sparks (Kostinskiy et al., 2016). The BTP (also known as the final jump)starts when the poorly-conducting streamer zones, developing ahead of the hot channels of negative downward leader (DL)and positive upward connecting leader (UCL), come in contact and a common streamer zone (CSZ)is formed. The beginning of BTP (establishment of CSZ)is usually marked by an abrupt current rise, a burst of dE/dt pulses (referred to as leader burst or LB), and hard X-ray emission. During the BTP, hot channels of both DL and UCL extend toward each other inside the CSZ, resulting in its shrinking, until the high-impedance CSZ is eliminated and low-impedance connection of DL to the grounded object is established. The process of bridging of CSZ by hot leader channels is accompanied by the formation of slow front (SF)in the channel current and in electric and magnetic field waveforms at both close and far distances from the channel. Attempted or relatively weak hot-channel connections producing current surges and associated field pulses superimposed on the SF (SF pulses)can occur. The SF lasts some microseconds and ends at the onset of the submicrosecond-scale fast transition (FT), which signifies the end of BTP. During the BTP, the current rises from the UCL level of the order of tens to hundreds of amperes to about 50% of the overall (SF + FT)current peak, which is of the order of tens of kiloamperes (for negative first strokes). This two orders of magnitude current rise during the BTP occurs before the collision of hot leader channels inside the CSZ; that is, before the onset of return stroke proper. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Attachment process; Breakthrough phase; Common streamer zone; Final jump; Lightning; Long sparks","Electric discharges; Rockets; X rays; Attachment process; Breakthrough phase; Electric and magnetic fields; Final jump; Hard x-ray emission; Lightning attachment; Negative first strokes; Triggered lightning; Lightning","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064757206

Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies examine brain regions engaged during performance of the n-back task in adults. The current meta-analyses are the first to examine concordance and age-related changes across the healthy adult lifespan in brain areas engaged when performing the n-back task. We compile data from eligible fMRI articles that report stereotaxic coordinates of brain activity from healthy adults in three age-groups: young (23.57 ± 5.63 years), middle-aged (38.13 ± 5.63 years) and older (66.86 ± 5.70 years) adults.

Critically, prefrontal cortex engagement is concordant for young, to a lesser degree for middle-aged adults, and absent in older adults, suggesting a gradual linear decline in concordance of prefrontal cortex engagement.

Here we prove that fully reciprocal periodic energy transport between the ends of a short homogenous chain of nonlinear oscillators is possible in the conservative classical system with the ‘soft’ nonlinearity.

Each image is associated with principal component scores of the high-dimensional features extracted by deep convolution neural network. Low number of principal components stand for the coarse-grained granules, while fine-grained granules include all components. Initially, first principal components of an observed image and all training instances are matched at the coarsest granularity level. Next, negative decisions are defined by using the multiple comparisons theory and asymptotic distribution of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Namely, the distance factors (ratios of the minimum distance and all other distances) are evaluated. The set of negative decisions is populated by the instances, for which the distance factors exceed a certain threshold. The images from this set are not examined at the next levels with finer granularity.

The main advantage of proposed model is the new approach to model the coupling which is implemented by smooth function that approximates rectangular function and reflects main important properties of biological synaptic coupling. The proposed coupling depends on three parameters that define: a) the beginning of activation of an element α, b) the duration of the activation δ and c) the strength of the coupling g. We observed a rich diversity of different types of neuron-like activity, including regular in-phase, anti-phase and sequential spiking. In the phase space of the system, these regular regimes correspond to specific asymptotically stable periodic motions (limit cycles). We also observed the canard in-phase solutions and the chaotic anti-phase activity, which corresponds to a strange attractor that appears via the cascade of period doubling bifurcations of limit cycles. In addition, we investigated an interesting phenomenon when two different chaotic attractive regimes corresponding for two different types of chaotic anti-phase activity merge in a single strange attractor. As a result, a new type of chaotic anti-phase regime appears by explosion from the collision of these two strange attractors. We also provided the detailed study of bifurcations which lead to the transitions between all these regimes. We detected on the (α, δ) parameter plane regions that correspond to the above-mentioned regimes.

Evidence exists for both feature-based and object-based storages, as well as hierarchically organized representations maintaining both types of information at different levels. One argument for feature-based storage is that features belonging to different dimensions (e.g., color and orientations)can be stored without interference suggesting independent capacities for every dimension. Here, we studied whether the lack of cross-dimensional interference reflects genuinely independent feature storages or mediated by common objects. In three experiments, participants remembered and recalled the colors and orientations of sets of objects. We independently manipulated set sizes within each feature dimension (making colors and orientations either identical or differing across objects). Critically, we assigned to-be-remembered colors and orientations either to same spatially integrated or to different spatially separated objects. We found that the precision and recall probability within each dimension was not affected by set size manipulations in a different dimension when the features belonged to integrated objects. However, manipulations with color set sizes did affect orientation memory when the features were separated. We conclude therefore that different feature dimensions can be encoded and stored independently but the advantage of the independent storages are mediated at the object-based level.

An approximation of the “averaged latitude” is introduced when the coefficients of the momentum equation are replaced by constant values corresponding to the latitude of the gyre’s center. It is shown that the resulting set of equations is similar to the equations of plane hydrodynamics.

People with imposter syndrome fear that others will eventually find out that they are frauds and thus feel that they do not belong in their academic or working environment despite objective qualifications, achievements, and accomplishments. Perfectionism has been linked to imposter syndrome due to a tendency to focus on one's inadequacies. In this study, participants were 169 Russian college students. Mediating and moderating effects of imposter syndrome on the link between perfectionism and psychological distress were examined. Results indicated that imposter syndrome fully mediated the link between perfectionism and anxiety, whereas it served as a partial mediator between perfectionism and depression. A significant moderation effect of imposter syndrome was found between the link of perfectionism and depressive mood. In sum, it appears that if a person does not fall into the imposter mindset, the positive link between perfectionistic discrepancy and depression no longer exists. Results of this study identify imposter syndrome as a point of intervention to prevent depression caused by perfectionism. © 2019","Anxiety; Depression; Imposter; Perfectionism; Russia",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061207390

We show that, in a wide range of cases, the Ein components are rational, and in the remaining cases they are at least stably rational. As a consequence, the union of the spaces M(e, n) over all n≥ 1 contains new series of rational components in the case e= 0 , exteding and improving previously known results of Vedernikov (Math USSSR-Izv 25:301–313, 1985) on series of rational families of bundles, and a first known infinite series of rational components in the case e=-1. Explicit constructions of rationality (stable rationality) of Ein components are given. Our approach is based on the study of a correspondence between generalized null correlation bundles constituting open subsets of Ein components and certain rank 2 reflexive sheaves on P 3 . This correspondence is obtained via elementary transformations along surfaces. We apply the technique of Quot-schemes and universal spaces of extensions of sheaves to relate the parameter spaces of these two types of sheaves. In the case of rationality, we construct universal families of generalized null correlation bundles over certain open subsets of Ein components showing that these subsets are fine moduli spaces. As a by-product of our construction, for c 1 = 0 and n even, they provide, perhaps the first known, examples of fine moduli spaces not satisfying the condition “n is odd”, which is a usual sufficient condition for fineness. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Moduli of stable bundles; Rank 2 bundles; Rational varieties",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063986236

In order to successfully respond to these global challenges, it is necessary to improve the quality of the university sector and rethink the role of professors in enhancing academic productivity. A 20-year period of recession after the collapse of the Soviet Union has led to a diversification of universities and teachers and resulted in both a sharp fall in academic salaries and a decline in the attractiveness of the academic profession. Since the professoriate constitutes the main source of academic productivity, this article assesses the consequences of the decline in the academic sector before the start of major reforms of academic salaries. Using the data from the ‘The Changing Academic Profession’ project (CAP-Russia 2012 subsample), we identified and evaluated the activities of the professoriate that determine the income of university staff. The results show that, in general, the number of publications positively affected academic salaries, but for certain indicators of research activity, the effects are ambiguous. Administrative duties are important for academic salaries, with a positive effect ranging from 15 to 51%. Seniority also has a positive impact on a professor’s salary. The most consistent results in the pre-reform period were obtained for National research universities (NRUs), where academic salaries are determined by research activity (articles in academic journals) and administrative duties. Salaries rise with seniority, which corresponds to the human capital theory (as well as alternative theories). Salaries in NRUs also reflect gender equality. The results of the study can be used to assess the consequences of the recession in the academic sector in Russia and as a baseline for analyzing current reforms in universities. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Academic contracts; Academic salaries; Academic salary; Administration; Research; Teaching",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052133525

Extracting all elements faster is impossible as this would violate the Ω (nlog n) bound for comparison-based sorting. It is known, however, that is takes only O(n+ klog k) time to sort just k smallest elements out of n given, which prompts that there might be a faster heap, whose extract-min performance depends on the number of elements extracted so far.

Even in neurologically healthy humans, MA of a small extent has been described, which does not directly lead to visible movements, but nonetheless, it is still detectable with surface electromyography (EMG) and therefore defined as physiological MA (pMA). The present study investigated latency- and amplitude-characteristics of pMA during repetitive unimanual isometric contractions with high but constant force requirements (80% maximum force). Here, we show for the first time that pMA is not time-locked to the muscle onset of voluntarily contracting hand muscles but starts with varying and dynamically changing latencies. Following consecutive isometric unilateral contractions, the latency of pMA progressively decreases accompanied by a progressive linear increase in its amplitude possibly as a result of changes in inhibitory mechanisms involved in suppressing involuntarily occurring muscular activity. Overall, the latency and amplitude of pMA show a strong inverse relationship. Furthermore, based on the previously proposed hypothesis of motor overflow, we explored the possibility of pMA modulation through anodal and cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied to the ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1), relative to a voluntarily contracting hand. Neither anodal nor cathodal tDCS is able to modulate amplitude or latency of pMA compared to sham tDCS. In conclusion, our results extend the existing knowledge of pMA occurring due to high-effort unilateral contractions with constant force requirements to the aspect of its latency and the inverse association with its amplitude. © 2019 The Authors","EMG; latency; mirror activity; motor overflow; tDCS","article; controlled study; electromyography; hand muscle; human; modulation; muscle contractility; muscle function; muscle isometric contraction; primary motor cortex; transcranial direct current stimulation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063632949

In 1907, the Innsbruck specialist in church law, Ludwig Wahrmund, publicly criticized the new ‘antimodernist’ and antiscientific trends of Catholic science, causing semester-long protests, fights, university closures and heated parliamentary debates. Antagonized in Innsbruck, Wahrmund relocated to Prague. The controversy triggered by his work, however, united students from across the monarchy in Wahrmund’s defence. In 1910, an analogous conflict arose in Cracow after Kazimierz Zimmermann was appointed professor of Catholic sociology. This time the protest against his teachings, although intensive, transgressed Galician boundaries only to a limited extent, failing to mobilize progressive student groups to go on the streets outside of the province. This article analyses the difference between protests against Wahrmund and Zimmermann from a spatial perspective. The author argues that the way both conflicts were received in politics and in local university cities indicates that there was an Imperial Austrian public sphere that transgressed national boundaries and linguistic divisions. Conflicts over contested topics, like the long-heated relationship between Church, science and higher education, were charged events that brought this public sphere to the fore. This translingual, imperial public sphere remained, however, hierarchically structured. A conflict in Innsbruck had more weight than one in Cracow, both within political discussions and in local presses. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Habsburg Monarchy; imperial public sphere; modernism; science and scandal; science vs. religion; universities",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053453318

Objectives: In this study we demonstrate how user-generated online content on side effects experienced by patients while taking a pharmaceutical product can be used to do research after the drug has been introduced to the market, thus allowing to complement the results of official clinical studies and market research. In particular, we concentrate on revealing the contribution of various side effects to reported customer satisfaction with Tamiflu, a popular antiviral drug. Methods: Publicly available data from an online platform with reviews from patients are used as an input to the analysis that applies statistical and machine learning methods (multivariate logit models and classification trees) to investigate the relationships of side effects to demographic characteristics and to the overall satisfaction with the medication. Results: We prioritized side effects of Tamiflu based on the significance of their association with patient's ratings published at one of the well-known drug discussion forums. Among all types of side effects used in our study, the neuropsychiatric symptoms and body pain are the most influential, followed by skin problems. Specific combinations of side-effects that are associated with low satisfaction were detected.

This study aimed to disentangle age, period and birth cohort effects for the first time in Russia to improve our understanding of these trends. Design: Age, period and cohort analysis of annual nationally representative repeated cross-sectional surveys [Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey– Higher School of Economics (RLMS-HSE)] using separate logistic models for each gender. Setting: Russia 1994–2016. Participants: A total of 195 234 respondents aged 14–85 years. Measurements: Age (14 groups: 14-17 to 76+ years), period (21 years: 1994–2016) and birth cohorts (17 groups: 1920–24 to 2000–02). Outcome measures were 30-day overall and beverage-specific alcohol use prevalence accounting for vodka, moonshine, beer and wine. Controls were per capita income, education, marital status, ethnicity, residence type and regional climate. Findings: Controlling for age and period effects, the most recent cohorts had lower rates of participation than older cohorts. Findings were valid for females born in 1995–2002 (P = 0.000) and males born in 1990–94 (P = 0.002) and 1995–2002 (P = 0.000). The period effects were strong in 1994–2003 due to intensive substitution of beer in place of vodka. Period effects were also important in determining a decline of prevalence in 2008–15 due to restrictive alcohol policy. Age effects showed an inverse U-shaped trend in both genders, except for moonshine and wine. Overall, drinking profiles were beverage-specific. Models indicated diverse beverage-specific effects of income, ethnicity, education, marital status and residence on the prevalence of alcohol use. Conclusion: The recent downward trend in alcohol use in Russia appears to be attributable to reduced participation rates among younger cohorts born after 1990. © 2018 Society for the Study of Addiction","Age–period–cohort modelling; alcohol use prevalence; repeated cross-sectional; Russia; trends; youth drinking",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060521413

Similarly, behavioral studies have shown both normal and abnormal face processing in developmental dyslexia. We tested whether dyslexic adults are impaired in tests of own-race and other-race face recognition. As both face and word recognition rely considerably on visual expertise, we wished to investigate whether face recognition problems of dyslexic readers might stem from difficulties with experience-driven expert visual processing. We utilized the finding that people tend to be worse at discriminating other-race faces compared to own-race faces, the so-called other-race effect, thought to reflect greater experience with own-race faces. If visual expertise is compromised in dyslexic readers, so that their visual system is not effectively shaped by experience, then they might show a diminished other-race effect. Matched dyslexic and typical readers completed two tests of own- and other-race face recognition. The results show that dyslexic readers have problems with recognizing faces, and these difficulties are not fully accounted for by general problems with attention or memory. However, recognition is compromised for both own- and other-race faces, and the strength of the other-race effect does not differ between dyslexic and typical readers. There was individual variability in both groups, and an exploratory analysis revealed that while dyslexic readers with no university education showed deficits in face recognition, the dyslexic participants with higher education did not. We conclude that dyslexic readers as a group have face recognition problems. These are potentially modulated by educational level but compromised visual expertise cannot demonstrably account for the face recognition problems associated with dyslexia. We discuss the implications of these findings for theoretical accounts of dyslexia and for theories of word and face recognition. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dyslexia; Face recognition; Fusiform gyrus; Other-race effect; Reading; Ventral visual stream; Visual expertise","adult; Article; attention; clinical article; dyslexia; educational status; experience; facial recognition; female; human; male; other race effect; other race face recognition; own race face recognition; priority journal; reading; short term memory; verbal memory; vision; visual expertise; word recognition","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062604302

This article focuses on the cultural aspect of European integration, which has been increasingly debated over the course of deepening and widening integration and in the context of the legitimation crisis of the EU. Among the main goals of the EU is to promote certain values, which raises the question of whether it has been efficient in (or enabled) reducing cultural value gaps among the participating countries. World polity and institutional isomorphism theories suggest that cultural values may trickle down in a vertical manner from the institutions of the EU to its member states and candidates. Furthermore, hybridisation theory postulates that values diffuse horizontally through intensified interactions enabled by the EU. These two perspectives imply the possibility of cultural convergence among countries associated with the EU. By contrast, the culture clash thesis assumes that differences in cultural identity prevent value convergence across countries; growing awareness of such differences may even increase the pre-existing cultural value distances. To test these different scenarios, distances in emancipative and secular values are compared across pairs of countries using combined repeated cross-sectional data from the European Values Study and the World Values Survey gathered between 1992 and 2011. This study finds that the longer a country has been part of the EU, the more closely its values approximate those of the EU founding countries, which in turn are the most homogenous. Initial cultural distance to the founders’ average values appears irrelevant to acquiring membership or candidacy status. However, new member states experienced substantial cultural convergence with old member states after 1992, as did current candidates between 2001 and 2008. Since 1992, nations not participating in the integration process have diverged substantially from EU members, essentially leading to cultural polarisation in Europe. The findings are independent of (changes in) economic disparities and suggest the importance of cultural diffusion as one of the fundamental mechanisms of cultural change. This empirical study contributes to the literature on European integration, political and sociological theories of globalisation, and cross-cultural theories of societal value change. © 2018 European Consortium for Political Research","cultural change; culture; diffusion; European Union; values",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047816907

Using Wave 1 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), the present study investigates the extent to which adjusting for differences in reporting behavior modifies gender differences in general health. We also examine whether men and women's reporting behaviors are consistent across different levels of education. After adjusting for reporting heterogeneity, gender differences in both poor and good health widened. However, we found no clear gender-specific patterns in reporting either poor or good health. Our findings also do not provide convincing evidence that education is an important determinant of general health reporting, although the female disadvantage in poor health and the male advantage in good health were more apparent in lower than higher education groups at all ages.

High-level defections can signal weakness, embolden the opposition, and sometimes, lead to regime collapse. Using a dataset of 4,291 ruling party candidates in Russia, this paper develops and tests hypotheses about the integrity of elite coalitions under autocracy. Our theory predicts that ruling elites defect when there is greater uncertainty about the regime's willingness to provide spoils. Regimes that share power with the opposition, limit access to spoils, and lack formal institutions see more defections. Co-opting the opposition assuages outside threats but leaves regime insiders disgruntled and prone to defection. Those with personal followings and business connections are the most likely to defect, since they can pursue their political goals independently of the regime. Taken together, our results highlight important tradeoffs among authoritarian survival strategies.

For this purpose, particles of Zr, Ti, and Si oxides have been synthesized in situ in the system of pores and channels of the membranes. Depending on the acid–base properties of oxides, introduction of nanoparticles can increase or decrease the water uptake, conductivity, and selectivity. A new approach to cross-linking of ion-exchange membranes by incorporating ZrO 2 particles into their matrix is proposed. Such cross-linking provides an improvement of swelling, conductivity, and salt permselectivity of the membrane in Na + -form.

For example, incorporation of 10 wt% of zirconia leads to a “cross-linking” of the membrane, i.e., binding of 45–50% of sulfonic groups, accompanied by a decrease of the water uptake by more than twofold and an increase of apparent transport numbers.

Function g is called separable if there exist n functions g i :X i →A for i=1,…,n, such that for every input x 1 ,…,x n the function g(x 1 ,…,x n ) takes one of the values g 1 (x 1 ),…,g n (x n ). Given a discrete function g, it is an interesting problem to ask whether g is separable or not. Although this seems to be a very basic problem concerning discrete functions, the complexity of recognition of separable discrete functions of n variables is known only for n=2. In this paper we will show that a slightly more general recognition problem, when g is not fully but only partially defined, is NP-complete for n≥3. We will then use this result to show that the recognition of fully defined separable discrete functions is NP-complete for n≥4. The general recognition problem contains the above mentioned special case for n=2. This case is well-studied in the context of game theory, where (separable) discrete functions of n variables are referred to as (assignable) n-person game forms. There is a known sufficient condition for assignability (separability) of two-person game forms (discrete functions of two variables) called (weak) total tightness of a game form. This property can be tested in polynomial time, and can be easily generalized both to higher dimension and to partially defined functions. We will prove in this paper that weak total tightness implies separability for (partially defined) discrete functions of n variables for any n, thus generalizing the above result known for n=2. Our proof is constructive. Using a graph-based discrete algorithm we show how for a given weakly totally tight (partially defined) discrete function g of n variables one can construct separating functions g 1 ,…,g n in polynomial time with respect to the size of the input function. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Separable discrete functions; Totally tight and assignable game forms",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060874537

Such configurations are found within the linear shallow-water theory and determined by a family of solutions of the second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) with three arbitrary constants. These solutions can be used to approximate the true bottom bathymetry. All such solutions represent smooth bottom profiles between two different singular points. The first singular point corresponds to the point where the two-layer flow transforms into a uniform one. In the vicinity of this point nonlinear shallow-water theory is used and the wave breaking criterion, which corresponds to the gradient catastrophe is found. The second bifurcation point corresponds to an infinite increase in water depth, which contradicts the shallow-water assumption. This point is eliminated by matching the “nonreflecting” bottom profile with a flat bottom. The wave transformation at the matching point is described by the second-order Fredholm equation and its approximated solution is then obtained.

It was shown that among 13 blood markers found in patients, 7 markers are characteristic of parkinsonian symptomatic mice and 3 markers of both symptomatic and presymptomatic mice. According to our suggestion, the detection of the same marker in patients and symptomatic animals indicates adequate reproduction of pathogenesis along the corresponding metabolic pathway, whereas the detection of the same marker in presymptomatic animals indicates its specificity for preclinical–prodromal stage. This means that the minority of markers found in patients—decreased concentration of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and increased dopamine D3 receptor gene expression—are specific for preclinical–prodromal stage and are suitable for early diagnosis of PD. Thus, we upgraded a current methodology for development of early diagnosis of PD by searching blood markers not only in patients but also in parkinsonian animals. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Animal model; Blood markers; Early diagnosis; Parkinson’s disease","3,4 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid; dopamine 3 receptor; levodopa; animal experiment; animal model; area under the curve; Article; body fluid; centrifugation; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; early diagnosis; electrochemistry; high performance liquid chromatography; human; lymphocyte count; male; mouse; nerve cell plasticity; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; prodromal symptom; protein blood level; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; Youden index","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052495117

Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative investigation was based on semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 26 Chinese expatriates. The grounded theory method was applied to guide the data collection and analysis. Findings: The psychological adjustment process of Chinese expatriates includes three periods: crisis, self-adjustment and self-growth period. In addition, bonding capital (including organizational, family and co-cultural colleagues’ support) is more conducive to Chinese expatriates’ psychological well-being than bridging capital (e.g. host-nationals’ support). Finally, a separation acculturation strategy is more conducive to psychological adjustment, rather than an integration strategy. Research limitations/implications: This study focused on expatriates themselves. Future research should consider other stakeholders (e.g. organizations, family), and examine expatriate adjustment from new perspectives (e.g. strategic human resource management, work-family balance). This study had a small sample and focused on only one organization. Future research could usefully add other Chinese multinational corporations, and other Chinese expatriates to expand the generalizability of the current findings. Practical implications: This study suggests the possible benefits of management practices for expatriates. Organizations can develop an “expatriate bubble” to help structure basic life overseas. Organizations could develop family-support programs and make them expatriate-supportive. Organizations should also strengthen the connections between expatriates and local colleagues. Originality/value: Few scholars have elaborated on how different support groups (based on their cultural backgrounds) influence the psychological adjustment of expatriates. Until now, mainland Chinese expatriates have received little attention. In addition, this research takes a significant step forward by illuminating the psychological adjustment of Chinese expatriates from a social capital perspective. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Acculturation; Chinese expatriates; Grounded theory; Organizational support; Psychological adjustment; Social capital",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061457094

However, the current manufacturing process of metal-based electroconductive textile yarn is expensive, unscalable, and environmentally unfriendly. Here we report a highly scalable and ultrafast production of graphene-based flexible, washable, and bendable wearable textile sensors. We engineer graphene flakes and their dispersions in order to select the best formulation for wearable textile application. We then use a high-speed yarn dyeing technique to dye (coat) textile yarn with graphene-based inks. Such graphene-based yarns are then integrated into a knitted structure as a flexible sensor and could send data wirelessly to a device via a self-powered RFID or a low-powered Bluetooth. The graphene textile sensor thus produced shows excellent temperature sensitivity, very good washability, and extremely high flexibility.

It was observed that all resulting oils demonstrate a considerable degree of similarity. For all samples, compounds containing 1 and 2 nitrogen atoms dominated in the positive ESI spectra, while a relative contribution of other compounds was small. In negative ESI mode, compounds having 2 to 7 oxygens were observed. Statistical analysis revealed that products can be combined in two groups depending on the solvent used for the liquefaction. To the first group, we can attribute the products obtained by using protic (alcohols) and to the second by using aprotic (acetonitrile, toluene) solvents.

We suggested that the driving force of the liquefaction reaction is the thermal dehydration of the carbohydrate in algae, resulting in water formation, which could be the trigger of the producing of bio-oil.

They cautiously reject improvements that might lead to worse profits after some reasonable response. For n-person games we introduce the notion of a reflection network consisting of direct competitors to express the idea of selective farsightedness. For almost every 2-person game with a complete reflection network, we prove the existence of a Nash-2 equilibrium. Nash-2 equilibrium sets are obtained in models of price and quantity competition, and in Tullock’s rent-seeking model with two players. It is shown that such farsighted behavior may provide strategic support for tacit collusion.

For example, after establishing that the symplectic vector space C n ≃ R 2 n underlies both global models, it is seen that for both systems the action variables generate the standard torus action on C n , and the fixed point of this action corresponds to the unique equilibrium positions of the pertinent systems.

Thus, under certain conditions, seemingly unimportant events can attract enormous attention and emotional involvement. One of those cases is the Dyatlov Pass Tragedy that occurred in 1959 in the Northern Urals, where nine hikers died under mysterious and still unknown circumstances. Nowadays, a half-century later, there are thousands of lay researchers searching for the truth and constructing competing explanatory accounts. In this paper, I propose the ‘trigger-narrative model,’ explaining the relation between mystery, governing narratives, and forms of sacrality, and apply it to the Dyatlov case. I argue that mystery is a ‘complex emotional attractor’—a symbolic mechanism shaped by the configuration of ‘elementary attractors’—‘strange’ things, symbols, or events, challenging commonsense narratives, which eventually maintains uncertainty and emotional tension. Every pattern of perception concerning mystery can be characterized by the tie between a trigger and its corresponding narrative; this tie is based on the transgression of the narrative by a trigger event. This model allows us to understand the cultural construction of mystery, which is crucially important for explaining how deep cultural structures energize people’s urges, concerns, and fascinations. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Dyatlov pass tragedy; Emotional attractor; Hierarchy of narratives; Interpretation; Mystery; Narrative; The sacred; Transgression; Trigger-narrative model; Uncertainty",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047270033

Design/methodology/approach: The authors determine the consumer value of university education in modern Russia in the conditions of the availability of predominantly traditional education; determine socio-economic problems that are caused by the low consumer value of university education in modern Russia; determine the potential of remote education in the increase of the consumer value of university education; and develop recommendations for the increase of the consumer value of university education in modern Russia through the development of remote education. Findings: It is concluded that traditional university education is dominating in Russia. It is standardized and does not allow for the full consideration of individual capabilities and needs of each separate student, which causes the low consumer value of university education. The limitation of traditional and remote education, caused by the fact that educational services in each form are provided by completely different universities, hinders the development of the potential of remote education in stimulating the increase of the consumer value of university education. Originality/value: In order to solve this problem, it is recommended to unify traditional and remote education within the diversification of the forms of the provision of educational services by modern Russian universities. For that, a conceptual model for increasing the consumer value of university education in modern Russia through the development of remote education is presented. This model focuses on applicant and students with their individual capabilities and needs and universities with their material and technical, intellectual, marketing and other resources.

The methods of regression and correlation analysis are used for that. Findings: The findings showed a moderate direct connection between the development of education and socio-economic position of the region if found. Qualitative analysis allowed substantiating large perspectives of using remote education as a means of restoring Russian recessing regions’ economy, which have two manifestations. The first one is related to the increase of accessibility of educational services in Russian regions. Due to this, the potential of development of region’s human potential is better realized. Being one of the key resources in the conditions of knowledge economy, human resources stimulate the activation of entrepreneurial activities, growth of labor efficiency and innovational activity of region’s companies. The second manifestation envisages the formation of entrepreneurship in the sphere of remote education as a growth vector and source of competitive advantages of recessing region’s economy. This opens possibilities for the formation of knowledge economy in region and supporting its high competitiveness. Low capital intensity of entrepreneurship in the sphere of remote education makes it accessible for development even in recessing regions, stimulating the growth of the volume of tax revenues into the regional state budget and formation of its positive balance.

As it turns out, democracy has been proceeding and continues to differentiate the world’s nations in a strongly culture-bound manner: high levels of democracy remain a distinctive feature of nations in which emancipative values have grown strong over the generations. By the same token, backsliding and autocratization are limited to cultures with under-developed emancipative values. In line with this finding, public support for democracy neither favours democratization, nor does it prevent autocratization in disjunction from emancipative values. On the contrary, public support for democracy shows such pro-democratic effects if – and only if – it co-exists in close association with emancipative values. The reason is that – in disconnect from emancipative values – support for democracy frequently reverts its meaning, indicating the exact opposite of what intuition suggests: namely, support for autocracy.

Research and thermal and physical calculations showed that heat loss from the premises is determined by two groups of factors: surface loss depending on thermal conductivity, as well as vapor and air permeability of enclosing elements and heat loss at all types of joints, fasteners, etc. Thermal insulation with plate materials significantly reduces heat losses, but at the same time, heat flows through the joints between the heat-insulating plates and in the areas of their contact with other structures, necessitating the use of steam and waterproof windproof roll materials. The usage of elastic and thermoplastic materials in the insulation circuit allows minimizing heat loss at the joints between the heat-insulating elements and along the smooth surface of the wall due to the low air and vapor permeability of the material. In the systems of frame cottages, when used as a thermal insulation of rolled foam-polyethylene, it becomes possible to form a seamless insulating shell of a building.

The problems of improving the environmental safety and financial stability of agricultural construction through the implementation of effective systems that provide energy conservation, the creation of comfortable conditions in the rooms are considered. It is noted that a factor that has been given special attention in recent years is the environmental safety of the materials used and the reduction of the negative load on the environment of systems using these materials. The article provides the rationale that the heat-efficient system should not only be based on the use of materials with low thermal conductivity, but should also suggest a reasonable minimization of the joints between the products included in the insulation sheath and between products and structures. In constructions with the use of polyethylene foam, seamless insulating sheath is formed, which has high thermal resistance. The low vapor and wind permeability and moisture conductivity of polyethylene foam makes it possible to dispense with the construction without additional vapor barrier and wind protection, which improves the performance of the casing and its durability due to the reduction in the complexity of manufacturing wall structures. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,"Building materials; Polyethylenes; Safety factor; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulation; Effective systems; Environmental safety; Financial stability; Innovative technology; Low thermal conductivity; Low-rise buildings; Moisture conductivity; Polyethylene foam; Economics","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064386928

One major component of this regimen included a total of 18 doses of weekly intramuscular (IM) native Escherichia coli-derived asparaginase (E. coli-ASP) at 10000 U/m 2 during three consolidation courses. ASP was initially available from Latvia, but had to be purchased from abroad at substantial costs after the collapse of Soviet Union. Therefore, the subsequent trial ALL-MB 2002 aimed at limiting costs to a reasonable extent and also at reducing toxicity by lowering the dose for standard risk (SR−) patients to 5000 U/m 2 without jeopardizing efficacy. Methods: Between April 2002 and November 2006, 774 SR patients were registered in 34 centers across Russia and Belarus, 688 of whom were randomized. In arm ASP-5000 (n = 334), patients received 5000 U/m 2 and in arm ASP-10000 (n = 354) 10 000 U/m 2 IM. Results: Probabilities of disease-free survival, overall survival and cumulative incidence of relapse at 10 years were comparable: 79 ± 2%, 86 ± 2% and 17.4 ± 2.1% (ASP-5000) vs. 75 ± 2% and 82 ± 2%, and 17.9 ± 2.0% (ASP-10000), while death in complete remission was significantly lower in arm ASP-5000 (2.7% vs. 6.5%; p = 0.029). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that weekly 5000 U/m 2 E. coli-ASP IM during consolidation therapy are equally effective, more cost-efficient and less toxic than 10000 U/m 2 for SR patients with childhood ALL. © 2019, The Author(s).","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia; Children; Multicenter trial; Native Escherichia coli-derived asparaginase","asparaginase; cytarabine; daunorubicin; dexamethasone; glucocorticoid; mercaptopurine; methotrexate; methylprednisolone acetate; prednisone; vincristine; antineoplastic agent; asparaginase; cytarabine; daunorubicin; Escherichia coli protein; mercaptopurine; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; prednisone; vincristine; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adolescent; adult; antileukemic activity; Article; cancer incidence; cancer therapy; cause of death; cause specific survival; child; childhood leukemia; consolidation chemotherapy; controlled study; disease duration; disease free survival; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug withdrawal; Escherichia coli; female; health care cost; hepatitis B; human; leukemia relapse; leukemia remission; long term care; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; mycosis; overall survival; pancreatitis; pneumonia; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; side effect; treatment duration; vomiting; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; clinical trial; dose response; enzymology; Escherichia coli; infant; preschool child; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Asparaginase; Child; Child, Preschool; Consolidation Chemotherapy; Cytarabine; Daunorubicin; Disease-Free Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Mercaptopurine; Methotrexate; Methylprednisolone; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Prednisone; Vincristine","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062670944

The main question to be addressed is the hypothesis that the prefix has been copied from the closely related Lezgian language. Approach, Data and Analysis: Firstly, I provide a detailed description of the morphology and semantics of the repetitive prefix (‘again’, ‘back’) in comparison to the system of locative prefixes in Agul, showing that despite the formal similarity with the ‘post’-localization prefix (meaning ‘behind’), the repetitive prefix is distinct both functionally and paradigmatically. I then compare the repetitive and ‘post’-prefix in Agul with their counterparts in Lezgian and other Lezgic languages. Findings/Conclusions: While the relation of the meaning ‘behind’ to ‘again’ is cross-linguistically common, the development of a special repetitive prefix in Agul is only attested in the two southern dialects, whose speakers have been in long-term contact with Lezgian – a language that possesses a productive repetitive prefix/infix. It is thus natural to assume that the Agul prefix has a contact-induced origin. I also show that this is not the only grammatical phenomenon of southern Agul that has been influenced by Lezgian. Originality and Significance: The morphological properties and functions of the repetitive prefix in Agul have not been described in detail before. The conclusion that this prefix is a morphological copy is remarkable, because Lezgian is one of the two languages most closely genetically related to Agul, and also because the borrowing of the prefix has led to the emergence of affixal ‘etymological doublets’ in Agul. Limitations: It remains to be investigated to what extent ‘post’-prefixes in other Lezgic languages show signs of grammaticalization towards repetitive prefixes, and also whether the two markers can become paradigmatically distinct, as with Agul. © The Author(s) 2017.","contact-induced grammaticalization; East Caucasian languages; Language contact; morphological borrowing; preverbs; refactive; repetitive; verbal prefixes",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064548566

The main characteristics of NoC topologies and the routing problem in NoCs with various topologies are considered. It is proposed to use two-dimensional circulant topologies for NoC design, since they have significantly better characteristics than most common mesh and torus topologies, and, in contrast to many other approaches to improving topologies, have a regular structure. The emphasis is on using ring circulants which although in some cases have somewhat worse characteristics than the optimal circulants, compensate by one-length first generatrix in such graphs that greatly facilitate routing in them. The paper considers three different approaches to routing in NoCs with ring circulant topology: Table routing, Clockwise routing, and Adaptive routing. The algorithms of routing are proposed, the results of synthesis of routers, based on them, are presented, and the cost of chip resources for the implementation of such communication subsystems in NoCs is estimated. © 2019 The Author","Electrical engineering",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064328010

In my analysis of the process, undertaken by certain Tatar Muslim representatives in Russia, of developing what I call a localised Islamic orthodoxy, I aim to study shifts in the debate on ‘traditional Islam’ towards a more theological understanding of the term. I examine attempts to develop a local interpretation of Islam that, while based on universal religious fundaments, is not in opposition to Tatar national traditions and a secular modern lifestyle. The representation of an ‘orthodox traditional Islam’ is necessarily paradoxical to the extent that a localised orthodoxy claims to be timeless, ‘natural’ and established but still needs to be defined, learned and taught following decades of Soviet atheist policies. Furthermore, this representation relies on the projection of orthodoxy onto the past in a process in which certain elements of a complex Tatar Muslim identity are made visible and emphasised (in particular, the Hanafi tradition), while others are obscured. By referring to the literature on orthodoxy in the anthropology and sociology of Islam and in Islamic studies, I aim to examine the theological dimension of the process of defining a local Islam that is currently being pursued by certain Tatar Muslim representatives in Russia. © The Author(s) 2019.","domestication of Islam; Islam in Russia; Islamic orthodoxy; Islamic theology; Tatar Muslims; traditional Islam",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061649674

By examining the growing role of fintech firms in the recent mergers and acquisitions from an investor point of view, this paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating the post-acquisition performance of the acquirer firms measured by abnormal returns. We discovered significant positive average abnormal return after acquisition of fintech companies in the short-term and negative average abnormal return in the long-term using event study methodology. The specifics of cross-border acquisitions, the level of the domestic market development of the acquirer, and other characteristics of M&A deals are considered in order to explain the reaction of investors to announcements of fintech firms’ acquisitions.

Methods: Univariate analysis and logistic regression models were performed using cross-sectional data from a representative sample of Russian adults (N = 4006). Results: 27.2% of Russian smokers did not comply with smoke-free bans. Non-compliance was attributed to sociodemographic characteristics of smokers, mainly to the number of cigarettes smoked per day, regular alcohol consumption, being aged between 15 and 34 years, being in the highest income group and living in an urban area. Neither the sex, nor the family status of smokers exerted a statistically significant affiliation with non-compliance.

In our experiments, observers adjusted the mean size of multiple objects presented at various apparent distances through a stereoscope. In Experiment 1, all items were shifted in depth by the same amount while the adjustable probe stayed at the fixed middle position. We found that presenting ensembles in an apparently remote plane made observers overestimate the mean size, which is consistent with angular sizes being rescaled to distance. In Experiment 2, we presented individual sizes in different planes. While angular sizes and apparent distances were kept controlled across conditions, we only manipulated correlations between them. These manipulations affected the precision of size averaging in line with changes in the range of apparent rather than angular sizes. This pattern is possible only if the visual system rescales each individual size to its distance prior to averaging. Our finding demonstrates that ensemble summaries of basic features, such as size, can be based on quite elaborated representations of multiple objects.

In this paper, we analyze user performance in dense urban mmWave deployments that are susceptible to blockage by the dynamically moving crowd. Our approach relies on the ergodic capacity as the key parameter of interest. We conduct a detailed evaluation with respect to the impact of various system parameters on the ergodic capacity, such as AP density and height, blocker density and speed, number of antenna array elements, array switching time, degree of multiconnectivity, and employed connectivity strategies. Particularly, we demonstrate that dual connectivity delivers the desired performance out of all possible degrees of multiconnectivity, and there is an optimal density of mmWave APs that maximizes the capacity of cell-edge users. We also show that the use of low complexity 'reactive' multiconnectivity design, where the beamtracking is only performed when the currently active connection is lost, together with the utilization of iterative beamsearching algorithms, does not significantly deteriorate the ergodic capacity. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Millimeter wave communication, 5G mobile communication, beam steering, multi-connectivity, dynamic blockage","Antenna arrays; Channel capacity; Directive antennas; Iterative methods; Radio waves; Access point (APs); Antenna array elements; Directional Antenna; Line-of-sight paths; Millimeter waves (mmwave); Mobile communications; Optimal densities; User performance; Millimeter waves","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064628647

Cubic root, Arrhenius and Batchinski mixing rules are tested for mixtures. The viscosities of pure components used in mixing equations are expressed as functions of volume of component rather than pressure. This allows to apply the mixing rules to metastable and stable liquids, dense supercritical fluids and solutions of gas in liquid. To obtain volumes of components in mixture, molecular dynamics method is used. The mixing rules predictions are compared against direct non-equilibrium molecular dynamics calculations of mixture viscosities. The best agreement with the molecular dynamics data is found when Batchinski mixing is used.

We test our hypotheses applying multilevel models to about 93,000 individuals from 75 countries covered by the cross-cultural World Values Surveys. We find that overestimating democracy is a widespread phenomenon, although it varies systematically across countries. Among a multitude of plausible influences, cognitive stimuli and emancipative values work together as a psychologically activating force that turns people against overestimating democracy. In fact, this psychological activation not only reduces overestimations of democracy; it actually leads toward underestimations, thus increasing criticality rather than accuracy in assessments.

Even greater gains in GDP (PPP) were seen for Moscow, the Russian capital, reaching $43 000 in 2015 and with a life expectancy of 75·5 years. We aimed to investigate whether mortality levels now seen in Russia are consistent with what would be expected given this new level of per-capita wealth. Methods: We used per-capita GDP (PPP) and life expectancy from 61 countries in 2014–15, plus those of Russia as a whole and its capital Moscow, to construct a Preston curve expressing the relationship between mortality and national wealth and to examine the positions of Russia and other populations relative to this curve. We adjusted life expectancy values for Moscow for underestimation of mortality at older ages. For comparison, we constructed another Preston curve based on the same set of countries for the year 2005. We used the stepwise replacement algorithm to decompose mortality differences between Russia or Moscow and comparator countries with similar incomes into age and cause-of-death components. Findings: Life expectancy in 2015 for both Russia and Moscow lay below the Preston-curve-based expectations by 6·5 years and 4·9 years, respectively. In 2015, Russia had a lower per-capita income than 36 of the comparator countries but lower life expectancy than 60 comparator countries. However, the gaps between the observed and the Preston-expected life expectancy values for Russia have diminished by about 25% since 2005, when the life expectancy gap was 8·9 years for Russia and 6·6 years for Moscow. When compared with countries with similar level of income, the largest part of the life expectancy deficit was produced by working-age mortality from external causes for Russia and cardiovascular disease at older ages for Moscow. Interpretation: Given the economic wealth of Russia, its life expectancy could be substantially higher. Sustaining the progress seen over the past decade depends on the ability of the Russian Government and society to devote adequate resources to people's health.

Following the seminal study by Maljkovic and Nakayama (1994), this ""priming of pop-out"" effect (PoP) has been widely described as an automatic bottom-up process that is independent of the observers' expectations. At the same time, numerous studies highlight the crucial role of expectations in visual attention deployment. Our experiment shows that in contrast to previous claims, PoP in a classic color singleton search task is a mix of automatic processing and expectations. Participants searched for a uniquely colored diamond among 2 same-colored distractors. Target color sequences were either predictable (e.g., 2 red-target-green-distractors trials, followed by 2 green-target-red-distractors trials, and so on) or random. Responses were faster in predictable color sequences than randomly changing ones with equal number of repetitions of target colors on preceding trials. Analyses of observers' eye movements showed that predictability of target color affected both latency and accuracy of the first saccade during a search trial. Our results support the idea that PoP is governed not only by automatic effects from previous target or distractor features but also by top-down expectations. © 2019 American Psychological Association.","Attention; Expectations; Priming of pop-out; Saccade; Visual search",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062303594

Based on framing approaches and concepts from socialization theory, we derive the following hypothesis: The links between religious beliefs and capitalist mentalities and the attitudinal acceptance of violence are stronger among individuals with low levels of education and a precarious economic status (compared to high education/nonprecarious status). The strongest link is expected for a negative status inconsistency (high education/precarious economic status).

A numerical model is presented taking into account the four scenarios of plasma acceleration that can be realized: (A) total dipolarization with characteristic time scales of ≈3 min; (B) single peak value of the normal magnetic component B z occurring on the time scale of less than 1 min; (C) a sequence of rapid jumps of B z interpreted as the passage of a chain of multiple dipolarization fronts (DFs); and (D) the simultaneous action of mechanism (C) followed by the consequent enhancement of electric and magnetic fluctuations with the small characteristic time scale ≤1 s. In a frame of the model, we have obtained and analyzed the energy spectra of four plasma populations: electrons e - , protons H + , helium He + , and oxygen O + ions, accelerated by the above-mentioned processes (A)-(D). It is shown that O + ions can be accelerated mainly due to the mechanism (A); H + and He + ions (and to some extent electrons) can be more effectively accelerated due to the mechanism (C) than the single dipolarization (B). It is found that high-frequency electric and magnetic fluctuations accompanying multiple DFs (D) can strongly accelerate electrons e - and really weakly influence other populations of plasma. The results of modeling demonstrated clearly the distinguishable spatial and temporal resonance character of particle acceleration processes. The maximum particle energies depending on the scale of the magnetic acceleration region and the value of the magnetic field are estimated.

These tails can point perpendicular or even opposite to the subhalo direction of motion, not tracing the recent orbital path. Thus, the observed tail direction can be misleading, and we caution against naive conclusions regarding the subhalo's direction of motion based on the tail direction. A head-tail morphology of a galaxy's or subcluster's gaseous atmosphere is usually attributed to ram pressure stripping, and the widely applied conclusion is that gas stripped tail traces the most recent orbit. However, during the slingshot tail stage, the subhalo is not being ram pressure stripped (RPS) and the tail is shaped by tidal forces more than just the ram pressure. Thus, applying a classic RPS scenario to a slingshot tail leads not only to an incorrect conclusion regarding the direction of motion but also to incorrect conclusions regarding the subhalo velocity, expected locations of shear flows, instabilities, and mixing. We describe the genesis and morphology of slingshot tails using data from binary cluster merger simulations and discuss their observable features and how to distinguish them from classic RPS tails. We identify three examples from the literature that are not RPS tails but slingshot tails and discuss other potential candidates. © 2019. The American Astronomical Society.

The ratio of branching fractions between the decay Ξ c + → pϕ and the singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay Ξ c + → pK − π + is measured to beℬ(Ξc+→pϕ)ℬ(Ξc+→pK−π+)=(19.8±0.7±0.9±0.2)×10−3, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic and the third due to the knowledge of the ϕ → K + K − branching fraction.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2019, The Author(s).","Branching fraction; Charm physics; Flavor physics; Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments)",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064530228

The measurement is based on a sample of pp-collision data, collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the LHCb detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2 fb −1 . The amplitude analysis of this decay is performed with the isobar model and a phenomenological model based on an effective chiral Lagrangian. In both models the S-wave component in the K − K + system is dominant, with a small contribution of the ϕ(1020) meson and a negligible contribution from tensor resonances. The K + K − scattering amplitudes for the considered combinations of spin (0,1) and isospin (0,1) of the two-body system are obtained from the Dalitz plot fit with the phenomenological decay amplitude.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2019, The Author(s).","Charm physics; Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments); Particle and resonance production",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064430112

Genome sequencing of multiple Streptococcus strains demonstrated high variability in gene content and order even in closely related strains of the same species and created a newly emerged object for genomic analysis, the pan-genome. Here we analysed the genome evolution of 25 strains of Streptococcus suis, 50 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and 28 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Results: Fractions of the pan-genome, unique, periphery, and universal genes differ in size, functional composition, the level of nucleotide substitutions, and predisposition to horizontal gene transfer and genomic rearrangements. The density of substitutions in intergenic regions appears to be correlated with selection acting on adjacent genes, implying that more conserved genes tend to have more conserved regulatory regions. The total pan-genome of the genus is open, but only due to strain-specific genes, whereas other pan-genome fractions reach saturation. We have identified the set of genes with phylogenies inconsistent with species and non-conserved location in the chromosome; these genes are rare in at least one species and have likely experienced recent horizontal transfer between species. The strain-specific fraction is enriched with mobile elements and hypothetical proteins, but also contains a number of candidate virulence-related genes, so it may have a strong impact on adaptability and pathogenicity. Mapping the rearrangements to the phylogenetic tree revealed large parallel inversions in all species. A parallel inversion of length 15 kB with breakpoints formed by genes encoding surface antigen proteins PhtD and PhtB in S. pneumoniae leads to replacement of gene fragments that likely indicates the action of an antigen variation mechanism. Conclusions: Members of genus Streptococcus have a highly dynamic, open pan-genome, that potentially confers them with the ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, i.e. antibiotic resistance or transmission between different hosts. Hence, integrated analysis of all aspects of genome evolution is important for the identification of potential pathogens and design of drugs and vaccines. © 2019 The Author(s).","Antigen variation; Gene inflow; Genomic rearrangements; Pan-genome; Selection in upstream regions; Streptococcus","antibiotic resistance; antigen; bacterium; evolution; gene; gene flow; gene transfer; genome; genomics; pathogen; selection; virulence; Animalia; Streptococcus; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Streptococcus pyogenes; Streptococcus suis","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063579425

To investigate the influence of load on working memory, we asked human subjects to maintain sets of letters in memory while we recorded single neurons and intracranial encephalography (EEG) in the medial temporal lobe and scalp EEG. Along the periods of a trial, hippocampal neural firing differentiated between success and error trials during stimulus encoding, predicted workload during memory maintenance, and predicted the subjects’ behavior during retrieval. During maintenance, neuronal firing was synchronized with intracranial hippocampal EEG. On the network level, synchronization between hippocampal and scalp EEG in the theta-alpha frequency range showed workload dependent oscillatory coupling between hippocampus and cortex. Thus, we found that persistent neural activity in the hippocampus participated in working memory processing that is specific to memory maintenance, load sensitive and synchronized to the cortex.

In this paper, we present a novel method for detecting broken bytes of a file, so the corrupted files may be detected. Also, the positions of wrong bytes might be helpful in restoring the original file content. This work is devoted to study of modern neural network models applied to detect corrupted bytes of a file problem. Since recurrent neural networks (RNNs) seem to be well suited for such tasks, the main tasks of this work are to analyze the efficiency of popular state-of-the-art RNNs solving the problem mentioned above and to compare the results of different models.

Unfortunately analytical treatment of communication systems with nonparametric reception remains a cumbersome task. Therefore simulation remains the main tool for the development of such systems. For multiuser systems supporting hundreds of active users and operating in fading channels (e.g. IOT) time spending grows drastically hampering the design process.

The measures taken are meant to reduce the risks of undesired consequences, but have strongly varying costs. Dynamic instrumentation and static analysis are common practices used to automatically find software defects, from strictly non-conforming code constructions to memory corruptions or invalid control flow. LLVM analyser and sanitizer infrastructure, while regularly applied to general-purpose software, originally was not thought to be introduced to heavily restricted environments. In this paper we discuss the specifics of airborne systems with regards to dynamic instrumentation and provide practical considerations to be taken into account for the effective use of general-purpose instrumentation tools. We bring a complete LLVM stack support to JetOS, a prospective onboard real-time operating system currently being developed at ISP RAS in collaboration with GosNIIAS. As an example, we port AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer and provide the details against the caveats on all relevant sides: a sanitizer, a compiler, and an operating system.

The turbulent moments can be determined separately for each of these sublayers by the linear approximations, which are proposed for the first and second turbulent moments of vertical velocity and potential temperature variance. The free-convection limits of the Monin-Obukhov theory corresponds to the first-order expansion terms of the developed approximations.

Therefore, the standard approach to the propagator calculation requires the involvement of numerically expensive procedures.

The SC wire acts as a bridge connecting the arms. The in-plane magnetic-field dependence of linear-response conductance obtained using the nonequilibrium Green's functions in the tight-binding approximation revealed the Breit-Wigner and Fano resonances (FRs) if the wire is in the nontrivial phase. The effect is explained by the presence of two interacting transport channels in the system. As a result, the FRs are attributed to bound states in continuum (BSCs). The BSC lifetime is determined by both hopping parameters between subsystems and the SC-wire properties. It is established that the FR width and position are extremely sensitive to the type of the lowest-energy excitation in the SC wire, the Majorana or Andreev bound state (MBS or ABS, respectively). Moreover, it is shown that in the specific case of the AB ring, the T-shape geometry, the FR disappears for the transport via the MBS and the conductance is equal to one quantum. It doubles in the local transport regime. On the contrary, in the ABS case the local conductance vanishes. The influence of the mean-field Coulomb interactions and diagonal disorder in the SC wire on the FR is investigated. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Aharonov-Bohm ring; Andreev bound state; Majorana bound state; topological superconductivity","Excited states; Quantum chemistry; Resonance; Topology; Aharonov-Bohm ring; Andreev bound state; Bound state; In-plane magnetic fields; Non-equilibrium Green's function; Spin orbit interactions; Superconducting bridges; Tight-binding approximations; Wire","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064723453

The object level offers flexible and modular tools to produce and automate the production of figures using an approach similar to that of Matplotlib with subplots. The second level visually connects these objects by controlling properties and interactions through graphical interfaces. The current release of Visbrain (version 0.4.2) contains 14 different objects and three responsive graphical user interfaces, built with PyQt: Signal, for the inspection of time-series and spectral properties, Brain for any type of visualization involving a 3D brain and Sleep for polysomnographic data visualization and sleep analysis. Each module has been developed in tight collaboration with end-users, i.e., primarily neuroscientists and domain experts, who bring their experience to make Visbrain as transparent as possible to the recording modalities (e.g., intracranial EEG, scalp-EEG, MEG, anatomical and functional MRI).

In his letter to Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Husserl claims that aesthetic and phenomenological experiences are similar; in the perception of a work of art we change our attitude in order to concentrate on how the things appear to us instead of what they are. A work of art “forces us into” the aesthetic attitude in the same way as the phenomenological epoché drives us into the phenomenological one. The change of attitudes is a condition of possibility of aesthetic and/or phenomenological experience. Estrangement is an artistic device that breaks the routinized forms of perception: one sees the thing as new and does not just “recognize” it automatically. Shklovsky insists that it is possible if one experiences or feels the form of the work of art—in an affective and even sensuous way. We claim that this is similar to the phenomenological seeing, or intuition, which, according to Husserl, should be devoid of all understanding. Phenomenological epoché can also be described as a philosophical technique that aims to arrest the “ready-made,” “taken for granted,” “pre-given” meanings in order to access a new meaning which is not yet stabilized, the “meaning-in-formation.” It is not enough to turn from what appears to how it appears; one has to oscillate between these conflicting attitudes, or rather to keep them both at the same time thus gaining a kind of a 3D-vision of meaning in its becoming. This double life in two different attitudes (or, following a Husserlian metaphor, “double bookkeeping”) can be clarified in terms of Roman Jakobson’s theory of antinomic coexistence between the poetic and communicative functions of language. The notion of “double life in two attitudes” uncovers the role that ostranenie can play in the philosophical transformation of the subject based on variety and essential mobility of the affective components involved. Proposing a phenomenological interpretation of a passage from Samuel Beckett we show how the radicalization of ostranenie can lead even to “meta-estrangement”: to estrangement of the everyday “lack of estrangement.” We conclude with a remark on the productivity of this form of estrangement in the phenomenological context. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Affectivity; Edmund Husserl; Estrangement (ostranenie); Phenomenological epoché; Poetical function of language; Viktor Shklovsky",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058058255

The latter is also supported by Raman spectra of the studied films where two pronounced peaks inherent to Cd3As2 were observed. The obtained x-ray diffraction patterns for studied films also correspond to the Cd3As2 lattice. The formation of a superconducting phase in the films under study is confirmed by the characteristic behavior of the temperature and the magnetic field dependence of the sample resistivity, as well as by the presence of pronounced zero-resistance plateaus in the dV/dI characteristics.

This is unexpected, since typically charges are trapped and lost on defects. First, BP has no ionic character. It interacts with oxygen and water weakly, experiencing little perturbation to electronic structure. Second, phosphorus supports different oxidation states and binds extraneous atoms avoiding deep defect levels. Third, soft BP structure can accommodate foreign species without disrupting periodic geometry. Finally, BP phonon scattering on defects shortens quantum coherence and suppresses recombination.

Then a hypothesis is tested suggesting that a competition authority, motivated by the criterion of “enforcement success,” tends to select relatively easy implemented enforcement targets, which lead to decisions with relatively low probability of being annulled if appealed. This is so, even though other enforcement targets would generate superior welfare effects.

Thus, Selective Rationalizability captures Common Strong Belief in Rationality (Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2002) and refines Extensive-Form Rationalizability (Pearce, 1984; Battigalli, 1996), whereas Strong-Δ-Rationalizability (Battigalli, 2003; Battigalli and Siniscalchi, 2003) captures the opposite epistemic priority choice.

The need for regular care for the self, primarily through consumption, constitutes part of the narrative of successful or positive ageing. Due to its emphasis on self-reliance and efforts to remain healthy, productive and youthful, the discourse of successful ageing has been seen as intersecting with a neoliberal rationality, or a shift of responsibility for risks associated with ageing from the state to the individual. While some authors criticise an emphasis on individual effort to maintain personal wellbeing for a lack of attention to structural factors, others view such an approach favourably as a way of transcending state paternalism. In this paper, I engage with the discourse of 'responsibilisation' drawing on the interviews with middle-aged, middle-class women from Moscow about their experiences of ageing. I employ the theoretical framework of 'governmentality' to demonstrate how the interviewed women's attempts to make sense of what it meant to age 'appropriately' within their milieus informed both their awareness of a need to improve and reinvent the self constantly through consumption in the context of post-Soviet Russian society, and their questioning of and resistance to this pressure. © Copyright Cambridge University Press 2017.","ageing; governmentality; Russia; women","aging; consumption behavior; elderly population; gender role; lifestyle; womens status; adult; aging; awareness; conceptual framework; drawing; female; human; human experiment; interview; middle aged; paternalism; Russian Federation; wellbeing; Russian Federation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034588374

The exploration of creative work in Russian art centres is of particular interest because it promises to record the transition of the contemporary art market from the Soviet-era cultural monopoly to the market economy, during the real-time formation of new, informal standards of cultural production. The present article evaluates what informality means within these new standards of the organization of creative work: while standing for culture ‘in a new and innovative way’, the new art centres preserve many residues of the ‘old system’, such as the practices of blat, favour-swapping and clientelism. The article is based on an empirical study conducted in 2016 which included 25 in-depth interviews with cultural workers employed full-time, and 20 live observations in offices and exhibition areas of the art centres. © The Author(s) 2019.","art centres; art-managers; creative labour; cultural workers; informal work; Moscow; Russia; transition",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060995756

A majority of Russians believe that public servants are concerned with improving their personal well-being rather than serving the public interest. Understanding working sector choices is thus the first step to attract talent into the civil service. We study public employment intention among a group of students of public administration in two elite Moscow universities who are relatively early undergraduates. Parents working in the civil service are the most important public sector career motivators of students in Russia, more important than positive perceptions of public sector compensation and its impact on society. Our findings imply that early-stage career plans are shaped outside university lecture rooms. We conclude that teaching public administration in Russia will have to focus on drawing a line between behavior that falls below standards of the profession and efforts to contribute to the well-being of citizens. © The Author(s) 2018.","career preferences; motivation; post-millennials; Public sector employment; Russia; unethical behavior",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058412427

While we do not know whether this claim is true, the proof of Theorem 9.2 in [1] in the case of T 2n (the only place in [1] where the claim was used) can be fixed in the following way (see [2] for more details). Below we use the notations of [1]. Consider the subgroup DiffH ? Diff+, consisting of all diffeomorphisms of T 2n acting by identity on H(T 2n). The action of DiffH on the Teichmüller space Teichs of Kähler forms (that is, the space of the Kähler forms on T 2n, factorized by the action of Diff0) preserves the fibers of the period map Per : Teichs → H2(M,R) (that is, the map associating to an element of Teichs the cohomology class of any Kähler form representing that element). We claim that this action is transitive on each fiber.b Indeed, by Proposition 6.1 of [1], any Kähler form on T 2n can be identified with a linear symplectic form by a diffeomorphism of T 2n. Moreover, with an appropriate choice of the map F appearing in the proof of that proposition, the latter diffeomorphism can be chosen to belong to DiffH. Since two linear cohomologous forms on T 2n = R2n/Z2n coincide, we get that any two cohomologous Kähler forms on T 2n - that is, representatives of two points of Teichs lying in the same fiber of Per - can be mapped into each other by a diffeomorphism from DiffH, which proves the claim. The transitivity of the action of DiffH on the fibers of Per and the fact that Per is a surjective local diffeomorphism imply that for any Kähler form w on T 2n the orbit of the image of w in Teichs under the action of Diff+/Diff0 is dense in Teichs if and only if the orbit of the cohomology class [w] under the action of Diff+/Diff0on H2(T 2n,R) is dense in the image of Per.

The present study is concerned with the domain of innovation policy, which is affected directly by societal and technological change and is a good archetype for demonstrating the scientific change perspective. In recent years, scientometrics has been frequently used to measure and analyze progress in science, technology and innovation. This study makes use of a combination of scientometric analysis and evolutionary framework analysis to demonstrate the evolution of innovation policy domain. Kuhn’s seminal approach is applied for classifying and interpreting the phases across the evolution of the domain within a 30-year timeframe. The analysis demonstrates that the innovation policy domain is at the “crisis stage” as a result of ongoing with transformations in the society, technology, economy and policy. These transformations affect both supply and demand sides of innovation and call for an evolution in the innovation policy domain. Although this by no means represents that the innovation policy domain is in a “deadlock”, the present study asserts that there is a new quest in innovation policy by adapting, re-framing or re-constructing the scope of the domain. The anticipated paradigm shift is expected to lead to a more de-centralized and distributed understanding of the world for innovation policy making. © 2019, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Evolutionary analysis; Innovation; Paradigm; Policy; Scientific change; Technology",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061040116

For instance, service engineers at Siemens diagnostic centres unveil hidden knowledge in huge amounts of historical sensor data and use it to improve the predictive systems analysing live data. Currently, the analysis is usually done using data-dependent rules that are specific to individual sensors and equipment. This dependence poses significant challenges in rule authoring, reuse, and maintenance by engineers. One solution to this problem is to employ ontology-based data access (OBDA), which provides a conceptual view of data via an ontology. However, classical OBDA systems do not support access to temporal data and reasoning over it. To address this issue, we propose a framework for temporal OBDA. In this framework, we use extended mapping languages to extract information about temporal events in the RDF format, classical ontology and rule languages to reflect static information, as well as a temporal rule language to describe events. We also propose a SPARQL-based query language for retrieving temporal information and, finally, an architecture of system implementation extending the state-of-the-art OBDA platform Ontop. © 2019 Elem Güzel Kalayci et al., published by Sciendo 2019.","metric temporal logic; ontology-based data access; Ontop; SPARQL query","Data mining; Ontology; Query languages; Extract informations; Metric temporal logic; Ontology-based data access; Ontop; Predictive systems; Sparql queries; System implementation; Temporal information; Search engines","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057572505

These studies yielded conflicting results, likely due to differences in stimulation parameters, experimental design and outcome measures. Objectives: In this work we aimed to assess the robustness of tDCS effects on long-term episodic memory using a meta-analytical approach. Methods: We conducted four meta-analyses to analyse the effects of anodal and cathodal tDCS on memory accuracy and response times. We also used a moderator analysis to examine whether the size of tDCS effects varied as a function of specific stimulation parameters and experimental conditions. Results: Although all selected studies reported a significant effect of tDCS in at least one condition in the published paper, the results of the four meta-analyses showed only statistically non-significant close-to-zero effects. A moderator analysis suggested that for anodal tDCS, the duration of the stimulation and the task used to probe memory moderated the effectiveness of tDCS. For cathodal tDCS, site of stimulation was a significant moderator, although this result was based on only a few observations. Conclusions: To warrant theoretical advancement and practical implications, more rigorous research is needed to fully understand whether tDCS reliably modulates episodic memory, and the specific circumstances under which this modulation does, and does not, occur. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Episodic memory; Long-term memory; Meta-analysis; Non-invasive brain stimulation; Recall; Recognition; Transcranial direct current stimulation","article; brain depth stimulation; controlled study; episodic memory; human; long term memory; memory; meta analysis; modulation; reaction time; systematic review; theoretical study; transcranial direct current stimulation","English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057266808

Such data are usually driven by formal models in EXPRESS language being part of the STEP standard (ISO 10303). To be consistent and unambiguously interpretable by computer programs the data must satisfy syntactic and semantic rules defined by the standards. Although ACID principles (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) are widely recognized and recommended for any information system, it is hard to guarantee the consistency of such complex data. Complete semantic validation requires extremely high costs, often exceeding the processing time of individual transactions. Periodic validation or validation on user demand is possible, but at a high risk of losing data that become useless in case of rule violation. In the paper an effective incremental method for semantic validation of product data is presented. It is guaranteed that the final data revision is consistent if only the original revision was consistent and the spot rules were not violated. Static analysis of the model specifications is applied and a dependency graph is formed. The dependency graph enables to identify the spot rules and the data that should be inspected against the rules. Computational experiments prove the effectiveness of the method in conformity to complex large-scale product data managed under an innovative platform PDMhub. © 2018","ACID; Data consistency; EXPRESS; IFC; Product data management; STEP",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057236166

To provide new evidence on fraudulent behavior in health care, we analyze the effect of a random audit including fines on individuals' honesty by means of a novel controlled behavioral experiment framed in a neonatal care context. Prevalent dishonest behavior declines significantly when audits and fines are introduced. The effect is driven by a reduction in upcoding when being detectable.

We investigated resting state neuronal activity and its relation to task performance by assessing traditional measures of alpha activity (power and individual alpha peak frequency) and dynamic properties of the signal measured by long-range temporal correlations (LRTC). Multichannel EEG was recorded at rest in 82 healthy male adults and compared to their cognitive performance, measured by tests involving executive functions, working memory, short- and long-term memory demands. Our results showed that attention-span scores positively correlated with alpha power at rest, with corresponding neuronal sources located primarily in the left-hemispheric anterior cingulate cortex, parietal regions, and bilateral suplementary motor areas. Furthermore, better working memory performance was related to increased LRTC of alpha oscillations at rest in the right hemispheric fronto-parietal, temporal, and occipital regions. Our findings suggest that resting state neuronal activity may reflect properties of brain networks that are functionally relevant for cognitive task performance.

However, karyotype and phenotype heterogeneity between individual cells in such cultures as well as multiplicity of target alleles make generation of desired cell lines by single-cell cloning (used for diploid cells) inapplicable. We designed and tested a simple approach for targeted genome modification of single cells in sizable cell populations, containing multiple karyotype and phenotype variants. To obtain the cell lines with suppressed expression of target proteins, we applied an original multiround genome modification protocol, monitoring protein expression level and impairment of target and off-target (undesired) DNA cleavage sites. We found that repeated modifications increase efficacy of target DNA allele disruption and decrease expression of corresponding proteins in cell populations in vitro. However, certain off-target activity was observed as well. Unexpectedly, we did not detect the increment of de novo off-target DNA site cleavage after CRISPR/Cas9 reuse, which proves our approach is suitable for genome editing in aneuploidy cell lines. Our protocol can be used for in vitro model creation by genome editing of aneuploid cells or cells with restricted clonogenic potential. Cell lines represent convenient models to elucidate specific causes of multigenetic and pluricausal diseases, to test breakthrough regenerative technologies. Most commonly used cell lines surpass diploid cells in their accessibility for delivery of large DNA molecules and genome editing, but the main obstacles for obtaining cell models with knockout-targeted protein from aneuploid cells are multiple allele copies and karyotype/phenotype heterogeneity. In the study, we report an original approach to CRISPR-/Cas9-mediated genome modification of aneuploid cell cultures to create functional cell models, achieving highly efficient targeted protein knockout and avoiding ""clonal effect"" (for the first time to our knowledge). © 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Cell model; Clone effect; CRISPR/Cas9; Genome editing; Heterogeneous cell culture; Off-targets","Cell culture; Cell proliferation; Cloning; DNA; Genes; Proteins; Cell model; Clonogenic potential; CRISPR/Cas9; Disease-causing gene; Genome modification; Individual cells; Protein expression levels; Targeted proteins; Clone cells","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063156927

Male physical strength may be used by men and women to assess the fighting ability of rivals and the quality of potential mates, respectively. Women more than men discriminate between strong and weak walkers when assessing gait attractiveness. We presented videos of British men’s gait—pre-categorized into strong and weak walkers—to male and female members (n ¼ 100) of the traditional Maasai in northern Tanzania in Africa. Maasai men and women judged the gaits of physically strong men less attractive than those of weak men and judged strong walkers to be weaker than weak walkers. These findings counter results from industrialized societies where participants accurately assessed strength from gait, thus arguing against a universal perception of physical strength from gait information. & 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

of Ξb- baryons in pp collisions relative to that of Λb0 baryons is reported, using data samples collected by the LHCb experiment, and corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1, 2 and 1.6 fb-1 at s=7, 8 and 13 TeV, respectively. In the kinematic region 2<η<6 and pT<20 GeV/c, we measure fΞb-fΛb0B(Ξb-→J/ψΞ-)B(Λb0→J/ψΛ)=(10.8±0.9±0.8)×10-2 [s=7,8 TeV], fΞb-fΛb0B(Ξb-→J/ψΞ-)B(Λb0→J/ψΛ)=(13.1±1.1±1.0)×10-2 [s=13 TeV], where fΞb- and fΛb0 are the fragmentation fractions of b quarks into Ξb- and Λb0 baryons, respectively; B represents branching fractions; and the uncertainties are due to statistical and experimental systematic sources. The values of fΞb-/fΛb0 are obtained by invoking SU(3) symmetry in the Ξb-→J/ψΞ- and Λb0→J/ψΛ decays. Production asymmetries between Ξb- and Ξb+ baryons are also reported. The mass of the Ξb- baryon is also measured relative to that of the Λb0 baryon, from which it is found that m(Ξb-)=5796.70±0.39±0.15±0.17 MeV/c2, where the last uncertainty is due to the precision on the known Λb0 mass. This result represents the most precise determination of the Ξb- mass. © 2019 2019 CERN, for the LHCb Collaboration.

studied in proton-lead collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of sNN=8.16 TeV recorded with the LHCb detector at the LHC. The measurement uses a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.2±0.3 nb-1 for the case where the proton beam is projected into the LHCb detector (corresponding to measuring hadron production at positive rapidity) and 18.6±0.5 nb-1 for the lead beam projected into the LHCb detector (corresponding to measuring hadron production at negative rapidity). Double-differential cross sections are measured and used to determine forward-backward ratios and nuclear modification factors, which directly probe nuclear effects in the production of beauty hadrons. The double-differential cross sections are measured as a function of the beauty-hadron transverse momentum and rapidity in the nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass frame. Forward-to-backward cross section ratios and nuclear modification factors indicate a significant nuclear suppression at positive rapidity. The ratio of Λb0 over B0 production cross sections is reported and is consistent with the corresponding measurement in pp collisions. © 2019 2019 CERN, for the LHCb Collaboration.

We account for measures of trust in strangers (often referred to as social trust), trust in neighbours (particularized trust) and trust in the police (institutional trust). We address endogeneity in the use of SNS by exploiting the variation in the availability of broadband for high-speed Internet, which relates to technological characteristics of the pre-existing voice telecommunication infrastructures. We find that all the forms of trust significantly decrease with participation in online networks.

The model accounts for the variation of the series resistance R of M-component channel due to its heating by the transient current and its subsequent cooling, longitudinal voltage drop along the channel due to the background continuing current, ohmic losses in the channel corona sheath (represented by shunt conductance G), and variation of series inductance L and shunt capacitance C of the channel with height above ground. The model was tested against the channel-base current and corresponding close electric fields measured for seven M-components in negative lightning triggered using the rocket-and-wire technique. Detailed sensitivity analysis was performed for one M-component. The influences of height-varying series inductance and shunt capacitance and the length of in-cloud channel (representing the excitation source) on the computed current and field waveforms were found to be relatively insignificant, while the influences of ohmic losses in the channel corona sheath and voltage drop along the grounded channel were significant. The effects of background continuing current level and grounding resistance were significant for M-field, but not for M-current. Model-predicted overall power and current profiles below the cloud base are consistent with the observed M-component luminosity profiles and are drastically different from the observed downward leader/upward return stroke profiles. The characteristic feature of M-components, the time shift between the current onset and close electric field peak (essentially absent for leader/return stroke sequences), was well reproduced by our model. ©2019.

The narrow segment is fabricated in the form of single line with the width and height of 50 μm and 6.7 μm, respectively. To remove the organic substance from the deposited material (dry residue of the ink), the printed microheaters were fired at 150°C for 20 min. The dependence of the operating temperature on the power consumed by the microheater was obtained from the measurements of direct current resistance as a function of consumed power with the use of previously determined temperature coefficient of the material (3.9·10 -3 K -1 ). © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

We demonstrate that two counterpropagating laser beams incident on a TMDC monolayer can deflect a superfluid polariton flow due to the generation the effective gauge vector and scalar potentials. The components of polariton conductivity tensor for both noninteracting polaritons without Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) and for weakly interacting Bose gas of polaritons in the presence of BEC and superfluidity are obtained. It is shown that the polariton flows in the same valley are splitting: the superfluid components of the A and B polariton flows propagate in opposite directions along the counterpropagating beams, while the normal components of the flows slightly deflect in opposite directions and propagate almost perpendicularly to the beams.

On the one hand, fossil fuels can be exploited much easier than before. On the other hand, their excavation leads to serious potential threats to fishing by changing natural habitats which in turn creates serious damage to the countries’ economies. Another set of problems arises due to the extension of navigable season for shipping routes. Thus, there are already discussions on how should resources be allocated among countries. In Aleskerov and Victorova (An analysis of potential conflict zones in the Arctic Region, HSE Publishing House, Moscow, 2015) a model was presented analyzing preferences of the countries interested in natural resources and revealing potential conflicts among them. We present several areas allocation models based on different preferences over resources among interested countries. As a result, we constructed several allocations where areas are assigned to countries with respect to the distance or the total interest, or according to the procedure which is counterpart of the Adjusted Winner procedure. We consider this work as an attempt to help decision-making authorities in their complex work on adjusting preferences and conducting negotiations in the Arctic zone. We would like to emphasize that these models can be easily extended to larger number of parameters, to the case when some areas for some reasons should be excluded from consideration, to the case with ‘weighted’ preferences with respect to some parameters. And we strongly believe that such models and evaluations based on them can be helpful for the process of corresponding decision making. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Arctic region; Arctic shipping; Areas allocation; Fishing resources; Oil and gas deposits; Zones of mutual interests",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056108893

The porous glasses were initially prepared via a rapid thermal quench from the liquid state across the glass transition temperature and allowed to phase separate and solidify at constant volume, thus producing an extended porous network in an amorphous solid material. We find that under periodic shear, the potential energy decreases over consecutive cycles due to gradual rearrangement of the glassy material, and the minimum of the potential energy after thousands of shear cycles is lower at larger strain amplitudes. Moreover, with increasing cycle number, the pore size distributions become more skewed toward larger length scales, where a distinct peak is developed and the peak intensity is enhanced at larger strain amplitudes.

However the electricity price time-series is generally infested with extreme values due to high price volatility. This paper discusses the impact of outlier filtering on forecasting accuracy based on a recently introduced seasonal component autoregressive model. We consider such methods of outlier detection (with a priori defined cut-off parameter) as threshold, standard deviation, percentage, recursive, and moving filter on prices. It is shown that such data pre-processing often leads to the forecasting accuracy gain while the error decrease (relative to the approach without filtering) in a number of cases may reach 1.8–1.9% of the average weekly price (in absolute values). For an a priori defined cut-off parameter, the simple threshold and standard deviation filter on prices outperform other considered methods, and yield to the accuracy gain in 63% and 67% of cases, correspondingly. At the same time, in case of the out-of-sample filter parameter grid-optimization all of the methods demonstrate comparable prediction power (equal to the marginal performance). But, practically speaking, such optimization is time-consuming and cannot be carried out on unavailable future data. As an competitive alternative, we propose a combined filter on prices based on a committee machine which uses the results of individual non-optimized algorithms and is not time-consuming, but gives accuracy comparable to the best one obtained for each of the studied electricity markets and leads to forecast gain in 63% of the considered cases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Committee machine; Electricity price forecasting; Long-term trend-seasonal component; Model confidence set; Outlier filtering","Commerce; Costs; Data handling; Forecasting; Statistics; Auto regressive models; Committee machines; Day-ahead power markets; Electricity price forecasting; Forecasting accuracy; Long-term trend; Optimized algorithms; Standard deviation; Power markets; accuracy assessment; algorithm; economic conditions; electricity; energy market; optimization; price determination","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057882953

However, the assumption that the function is onto with respect to singletons makes the Duggan–Schwartz theorem inapplicable to elections which necessarily select multiple winners. In this paper we make a start on this problem by considering rules which always elect exactly two winners (such as the consulship of ancient Rome). We establish that if such a consular election rule cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint social choice functions, then strategy-proofness implies the existence of a dictator.

Design/methodology/approach: The methodology is based on mutual enrichment of methods and results of BM and business-to-business marketing studies that are relatively isolated from each other, and on integration of them to the unified structured approach that could be applied to analyze both BM and a set of interfirm relationships of networked market players. This paper is based on extensive literature review in the areas of BM and relationship/industrial marketing. The review is based on most cited and contemporary articles found in the Scopus and EBSCO databases. Findings: This paper formulates the key BM research directions and visualizes their development over time. It is demonstrated in the paper that currently, there is little involvement of marketing researchers in the study of BM; however, there are multiple touchpoints between these areas of knowledge, which can help in further developing BM studies. On the basis of these findings, a conceptual model and new network-based approach to BM analysis is offered, which allows addressing the complex nature of networked interaction among BM participants. The approach includes stepwise algorithm for BM analysis designed for business practitioners. Research limitations/implications: The proposed approach can be applied by business practitioners to analyze and improve their BM via managing the interactions of inter-organizational network participants with a focus on customer interests. While the approach is of a universal character, the specific tools for evaluating BM on each stage may vary across different markets. Originality/value: This research contributes to the current conceptual knowledge on BM studies development and their relationship with marketing. It also contributes to theory and practice by the development of a new marketing-based approach to the BM analysis focused on managing business relationships, which allows evaluation of the current state of a BM and provides directions for its improvement. This approach evaluates the alignment of interfirm relationships along the value chain and orients it toward the final consumer. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business model; Interfirm relationships; Marketing; Research directions; Value creation and delivery",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056360965

We consider the Moran model of finite population evolution with selection in a randomly changing, dynamic environment. In the model, each individual has one of the two alleles, wild type or mutant. We calculate the fixation probability by making a proper ansatz for the logarithm of fixation probabilities. This method has been used previously to solve the analogous problem for the Wright-Fisher model. The fixation probability is related to the solution of a third-order algebraic equation (for the logarithm of fixation probability). We consider the strong interference of landscape fluctuations, sampling, and selection when the fixation process cannot be described by the mean fitness. Such an effect appears if the mutant allele has a higher fitness in one landscape and a lower fitness in another, compared with the wild type, and the product of effective population size and fitness is large. We provide a generalization of the Kimura formula for the fixation probability that applies to these cases.

If the algebra is graded, then the rationality of the Hilbert series of the algebra follows from the affirmative answer to Ufnarovski's question. Assuming that the ground field has a positive characteristic, we show that the answer to Ufnarovskii's question is positive for graded algebras if and only if the basic field is an algebraic extension of its prime subfield. Moreover, in the “only if” part we show that there exists a finitely presented graded algebra of linear growth with irrational Hilbert series. In addition, over an arbitrary infinite basic field, the set of Hilbert series of the quadratic algebras of linear growth with 5 generators is infinite. Our approach is based on a connection with the dynamical Mordell–Lang conjecture. This conjecture describes the intersection of an orbit of an algebraic variety endomorphism with a subvariety. We show that the positive answer to Ufnarovski's question implies some known cases of the dynamical Mordell–Lang conjecture. In particular, the positive answer for a class of algebras is equivalent to the Skolem–Mahler–Lech theorem which says that the set of the zero elements of any linear recurrent sequence over a zero characteristic field is the finite union of several arithmetic progressions. In particular, the counter-examples to this theorem in the positive characteristic case give examples of algebras with irrational Hilbert series. © 2018","Automaton algebra; Dynamical Mordell–Lang conjecture; Graded algebra; Growth; Hilbert series; Linear recurrence",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057274738

Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected via in-person interviews in the City of Perm, which is one of the largest and most industrial cities in Russia. A double-bounded dichotomous-choice contingent valuation model is utilized to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) and to analyze factors that affect consumers’ choice. Findings: The results suggest that most respondents do not consider domestically produced cheese as a risky product in terms of food safety but simply of lower quality than imported cheese. However, the average respondent’s WTP discount for domestic cheese compared to imported cheese is 8 percent, which is relatively small. This corresponds to participants’ opinion that buying domestic cheese is the right thing to do since it supports Russian farmers and producers. The results indicate further that with increasing education and income levels, individuals are less likely to prefer domestically produced cheese for either economic or quality reasons. This effect is stronger for the quality preference. Research limitations/implications: The results indicate that if the Russian government aims at expanding the domestic food market further, more attention needs to be paid to ensuring the quality of domestic food products in order to increase consumer acceptance and WTP. Originality/value: This is the first study providing empirical evidence on Russian consumers’ attitudes and perceptions of domestically vs imported food products after the implementation of the Russian import ban, which can be considered as an external policy shock. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer attitudes; Contingent valuation; Food quality; Russian import ban; Willingness to pay","adult; agricultural worker; article; attention; cheese; city; consumer attitude; contingent valuation; education; female; food quality; food safety; government; human; human experiment; interview; male; market; perception; Russian Federation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055449210

To understand what makes these constructions different from one another, compounds in -ec and -tel’ are analyzed based on a number of formal and semantic criteria, i.e., the part of speech and semantic role of the non-verbal element of the compound, the transitivity and formal aspect of the verbal base of the compound, the animacy of the compound’s referent, and the semantics of the compound. The study is supported by statistical analyses, i.e., conditional inference trees and random forests, which help discriminate the behavior of rival constructions and determine which parameters are more relevant for the comparison. To understand whether diachronic and/or stylistic factors also affect the survival of rival constructions, the data are checked in the Russian National Corpus, which allows retrieving information about the texts in which compounds occur, such as their creation date and textual genre. Finally, the productivity of rival word-formation constructions in modern Russian is discussed both in terms of diachronic changes and in terms of restrictions that the two constructions are subject to. The analyses carried out demonstrate that the two constructions show significant differences regarding their semantics, but also their diachronic and stylistic distribution, as well as their productivity, which prevents one construction from completely ousting the other in modern Russian. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","(Para)synthetic compounds; Agentive suffixes; Compound agent nouns; Modern Russian; Rival word-formation constructions",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053535235

The resulting numbers are compared to the overall volume of obligations borne by the serfs to the state and to their landlords. Our conclusion is that while the facilitation payments were ubiquitous and accompanied any interaction with the state, the volume of these ‘routine’ payments (as opposed to other forms of extraction) was quite low and they did not put a significant burden on the peasants, while at the same time securing hefty extra incomes for top district officials. Rather, by the last decades of the eighteenth century Russian Imperial officials at the district level might have switched from a tribute-like extortion from the population at large to acquiring vast sums by collecting unofficial payments in more targeted ways. © Economic History Society 2018",,"corruption; economic history; eighteenth century; expenditure; income; nineteenth century; Russian Federation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042390584

In the study reported here, we found no differences in the production of accented and unaccented stems. Instead, the analysis of errors revealed that the significant factors determining stress placement include stress neighbourhood and stress position. The speakers produced fewer errors in consistently spelled words, and there was a strong tendency to shift stress to the final syllable in consonant-final words, and to the penultimate syllable in vowel-final words. These results indicate that distributional properties play an important role in stress assignment in both accented and unaccented stem types. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.",,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064863270

The purpose of the work is to establish stability regions for the rare-earth orthoborates in crystallochemical coordinates (sizes of Ln and M ions) based on their real compositions and space symmetry depending on thermodynamic, kinetic, and crystallochemical factors. The use of diffraction structural techniques to study single crystals with a detailed analysis of diffraction patterns, refinement of crystallographic site occupancies (real composition), and determination of structure-composition correlations is the most efficient and effective option to achieve the purpose. This approach is applied and shown primarily for the rare-earth scandium borates having interesting structural features compared with the other orthoborates. Visualization of structures allowed to establish features of formation of phases with different compositions, to classify and systematize huntite-family compounds using crystallochemical concepts (structure and superstructure, ordering and disordering, isostructural and isotype compounds) and phenomena (isomorphism, morphotropism, polymorphism, polytypism). Particular attention is paid to methods and conditions for crystal growth, affecting a crystal real composition and symmetry.

The goal of this study was to test the differential attrition of verb aspect and tense in L1 (Russian) under the influence of L2 (German) grammatical properties. We also investigated whether the age of bilingualism onset and the amount of exposure to L1 modulate this L2 transfer effect. Methodology: We tested sentence processing in 30 adult Russian monolingual participants and 30 L1 attritors – Russian-German bilingual speakers – with early versus late bilingualism onset and with low versus high amounts of exposure to L1. Participants heard grammatically correct sentences, sentences with aspect violations and sentences with tense violations, and were asked to detect errors. Data and Analysis: The accuracy of participants’ responses was analysed using generalized linear mixed-effects modelling in R. Findings: The L2 transfer effect was found, but was strongly modulated by the amount of L1 exposure: only bilinguals with little exposure to L1 showed greater attrition of L1 aspect compared to L1 tense. Moreover, the age of bilingualism onset proved to be more critical than the L2 transfer effect: an earlier bilingualism onset resulted in greater attrition of both aspect and tense in L1. Originality: The study provided new evidence about the differential impact of the grammatical similarity between L1 and L2, the age of bilingualism onset and the amount of L1 exposure on aspect and tense processing in L1 attritors. Implications: Our findings suggest that greater L1 use after immigration helps bilingual speakers to be less susceptible to L2 transfer and prevents attrition of L1-specific grammatical categories. Also, a general decline in processing verbal morphology is more likely to occur in speakers with an early rather than a late onset of bilingualism. © The Author(s) 2017.","bilingualism; first language attrition; Russian; tense; Verb aspect",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061652019

What made us think that self-determination theory (SDT) might provide a sort of foundation for the rest of personality psychology? For readers unfamiliar with SDT, we then provide a historical overview that covers the evolution of the six “mini-theories” that currently compose SDT: cognitive evaluation theory, causality orientations theory, organismic integration theory, basic psychological needs theory, goal contents theory, and relational motivation theory. Following each section are preliminary suggestions about how each mini-theory might be useful or informative in other branches of personality. This special issue contains nine articles, each of which makes its own attempt to newly link its area of personality research to SDT. Even if SDT is not the appropriate seed for greater consilience in personality psychology, we urge the field not to neglect the search for unifying principles (Sheldon, Cheng, & Hilpert, 2011); it may finally be time to renew the search for a “grand theory” in personality. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"article; human; human experiment; motivation; neglect; personality; plant seed; rest; scientist","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060479377

Integrated H densities of SWAN at a tangent distance of 7 R E are larger than LAICA/Orbiting Geophysical Observatory number 5 by factors 1.1–2.5, while we should expect a stronger effect of the radiation pressure at solar max. We discuss the possible role of H atoms in satellite orbits to explain this apparent contradiction. An onion-peeling technique is used to retrieve hydrogen number density in the exosphere for the three SWAN observations. They show an excess of density versus models at large distances, which is likely due to nonthermal atoms (not in the model). ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

We consider the class of hyperelliptic curves where the Newton polygons contain only four boundary points. We present the corresponding cluster integrable Toda systems and identify their discrete automorphisms with certain reductions of the Hirota difference equation. We also construct nonautonomous versions of these equations and find that their solutions are expressed in terms of five-dimensional Nekrasov functions with Chern–Simons contributions, while these equations in the autonomous case are solved in terms of Riemann theta functions. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","cluster algebra; integrable system; supersymmetric gauge theory; topological string",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065230970

Cabibbo-suppressed D 0 → K + K − π + π − decay mode is performed using an amplitude analysis. The measurement uses a sample of pp collisions recorded by the LHCb experiment during 2011 and 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb −1 . The D 0 mesons are reconstructed from semileptonic b-hadron decays into D 0 μ − X final states. The selected sample contains more than 160 000 signal decays, allowing the most precise amplitude modelling of this D 0 decay to date. The obtained amplitude model is used to perform the search for CP violation. The result is compatible with CP symmetry, with a sensitivity ranging from 1% to 15% depending on the amplitude considered.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2019, The Author(s).","Charm physics; CP violation; Flavor physics; Hadron-Hadron scattering (experiments)",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062012900

In this paper we address the problem of improving the network scalability for one of the most widely used today licensee-free-band LPWAN technologies, named LoRaWAN. We show that the conventional method for assigning the spreading factor (SF) parameter to the devices in a LoRaWAN network, which effectively minimizes the consumption of individual devices, has some drawbacks when this comes to the scalability of the network as whole. Therefore, in this paper we propose another method of assigning the SFs to the nodes, which improves the probability of data delivery in an LPWAN at a cost of minor increase of the devices' consumption. The results of the conducted simulations confirm and characterize the utility of the proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.","Communication; Energy consumption IoT; Long range; LoRa; Low power; LPWAN; Scalability; Wide area network; Wireless","Communication; Control systems; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Low power electronics; Radio; Scalability; Conventional methods; Internet of thing (IOT); Long range; LoRa; Low Power; LPWAN; Network scalability; Resource-limited devices; Wide area networks","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062772229

Its logarithmic derivatives with respect to parameters are given by contour integrals involving these parametrices and the solution of the Riemann–Hilbert problem. In the case of one circle, the tau function coincides with Widom’s determinant arising in the asymptotics of block Toeplitz matrices.

We thereby reveal, in addition to the spin-valley antiferromagnet at ν=0, two insulating states developing in positive and negative effective magnetic fields from the main ν=1 and ν=-2 quantum Hall states, respectively. We investigate the field dependence of the energy gaps associated with these insulating states, which we quantify from the temperature-activated peak resistance.

The flashes were observed on 4 June 2016 at the Tall Object Lightning Observatory in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. The optical and electric field characteristics of these flashes were analyzed using synchronized two-station data from two high-speed video cameras, one total-sky lightning channel imager, two lightning channel imagers, and two sets of slow and fast electric field measuring systems. Three upward flashes were initiated sequentially in the field of view of high-speed video cameras. One of them was initiated approximately 0.35 ms after the return stroke of +CG flash from the Canton Tower, the tallest structure within a 12-km radius of the +CG flash, while the other two upward flashes were initiated from two other, more distant tall objects, approximately 18 ms after the +CG flash stroke. The initiation of the latter two upward flashes could be caused by the combined effect of the return stroke of +CG flash, its associated continuing current, and K process in the cloud. Each of these three upward flashes contained multiple downward leader/upward return stroke sequences, with the first leader/return stroke sequence of the second and third flashes occurring only after the completion of the last leader/return stroke sequence of the preceding flash.

The goal of this study was to develop and put to the test a novel method for studying the dynamics of insight problem solving based on a quantitative analysis of ongoing motor activity. As a proper problem model, we chose the nine-dot problem (Maier, 1930), in which solvers had to draw a sequence of connected line segments. Instead of using the traditional pen-and-paper way of solving the nine-dot problem we asked participants to use their index finger to draw line segments on the surface of a tablet computer. We are arguing that successful studying of the role of motor activity during problem solving requires the distinction between its instrumental and functional role. We considered the functional role on the motor activity as closely related to the on-line mode of motor planning. The goal of Experiment 1 was to explore the potential power of the method and, at the same time, to assay the patterns of motor activity related to on-line and off-line modes of motor planning. Experiments 2 and 3 were designed to uncover the potential impact of preliminary motor training on the motor output of successful and unsuccessful problem solvers. In these experiments, we tested hypotheses on how preliminary motor training, which presumably played a functional role in Experiment 2 and an instrumental role in Experiment 3, affects the motor activity of a problem solver and hence their effectiveness in solving the problem. The three experiments showed consistent results. They suggest that successful solving of the nine-dot problem relies upon the functional role of motor activity and requires both off-line and on-line modes of motor planning, with the latter helping to overcome the perceptual constraints imposed by a spatial arrangement of the nine dots. The method that we applied allows for systematic comparison between successful and unsuccessful problem solvers based on the quantitative parameters of their motor activity. Through it, we found new specific patterns of motor activity that differentiate successful and unsuccessful solvers. © 2019 Spiridonov, Loginov, Ivanchei and Kurgansky.","Insight; Motor planning; Nine-dot problem; Preliminary motor training; Problem solving",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060443265

One of the mechanisms of transcription regulation is nucleosome positioning. Even though only B-DNA can be wrapped around a nucleosome, non-B DNA structures can compete with a nucleosome for a genomic location. Here we used permanganate/S1 nuclease footprinting data on non-B DNA structures, such as Z-DNA, H-DNA, G-quadruplexes and stress-induced duplex destabilization (SIDD) sites, together with MNase-seq data on nucleosome positioning in the mouse genome. We found three types of patterns of nucleosome positioning around non-B DNA structures: a structure is surrounded by nucleosomes from both sides, from one side, or nucleosome free region. Machine learning models based on random forest and XGBoost algorithms were constructed to recognize DNA regions of 1kB length containing a particular pattern of nucleosome positioning for four types of DNA structures (Z-DNA, H-DNA, G-quadruplexes and SIDD sites) based on statistics of di- and tri-nucleotides. The best performance (94% of accuracy) was reached for Gquadruplexes while for other types of structures the accuracy was under 70%. We conclude that 1kB regions containing Gquadruplexes have distinct compositional properties, and this fact points to preferential locations of such pattern in the genome and requires further investigation. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the genes intersecting with the discovered patterns are enriched in channel and transmembrane activity, transcription factor and receptor binding. The direction for further research is to study the distribution of the discovered patterns in different tissues to identify well-positioned and dynamic nucleosomes and reveal genes, regulated via DNA structures and nucleosome positioning. © 2018 IEEE.","DNA structures; G-quadruplexes; gradient boosting; H-DNA; machine-learning methods; non-B DNA; nucleosome positioning; pattern recognition; random forest; triplex DNA; Z-DNA","Adaptive boosting; Decision trees; DNA; Machine learning; Pattern recognition; Transcription; DNA structure; G-quadruplexes; Gradient boosting; Machine learning methods; Nucleosomes; Random forests; Triplex DNA; Bioinformatics","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062552716

This technique has unraveled many principles of chromosomal folding, including subdivision of the genome into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). Moreover, the correlation between the structure of chromatin and various factors such as transcriptional repressor CTCF binding sites, replication timing and many epigenetic features has been discovered [1-3].Our study focuses on application of Machine Learning methods to explore the 3D structure of chromatin. We predicted TADs annotation based on a comprehensive set of predictors that includes chromatin marks and histone modifications. The data from the following ChIP-seq experiments have been selected:Chriz, CTCF, Su(Hw), BEAF-32, CP190, Smc3, GAF, H3K27me3, H3K27a, H3K36me1, H3K36me3, H3K4me1, H3K9ac, H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H4K16acThe target value is a characteristic that corresponds to the Topologically Associated Domains annotation using the Armatus software [4]. The objects are DNA sequence fragments of 20000 bp of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.We consider linear regression models with three types of regularization (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net) and Neural Networks. The sequential relationship of the DNA bins in terms of the physical distance justifies the usage of Recurrent Neural Networks. We built RNN architectures with different numbers of LSTM units and the input size from 1 to 10 DNA bins. The predictive models were trained and evaluated using a weighted MSE score. The mean target value of the train dataset was used as a constant prediction to estimate the performance of the models. The best score of weighted MSE was demonstrated by bidirectional LSTM RNN with 64 units. The input size of this modes is six DNA bins which is also equal to the average size of TADs. The most accurate RNN strongly outperforms the contant prediction and all four linear models. A protein Chriz is known to be associated with formation of chromatin domains in Drosophila melanogaster [5]. The feature corresponding to Chriz was selected by the linear models with L1 normalization as the most informative one.

While there exist numerous bioinformatics tools for the TADs identification, the choice of a method and its adjustable set of parameters influences the number of the identified TADs and their characteristics.

A jump-like increase in the sizes of the strange attractor and strange repeller, which is due to the heteroclinic intersections of the invariant manifolds of the saddle points belonging to the attractor and the repeller, is the key point of the scenario. Such heteroclinic intersections appear immediately after the collisions of the strange attractor and the strange repeller with the boundaries of their attraction and repulsion basins, respectively, after which the attractor and the repeller intersect. Then the dissipative chaotic dynamics related to the existence of the mutually separable strange attractor and strange repeller immediately becomes mixed when the attractor and the repeller are essentially inseparable. The possibility of realizing the proposed scenario is demonstrated using a well-known problem of the rigid-body dynamics, namely, the nonholonomic model of the Suslov top. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Electron optics; Chaotic dynamics; Diffeomorphisms; Invariant manifolds; Nonholonomic model; Reversible systems; Rigidbody dynamics; Saddle point; Strange attractors; Magnetic materials","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064343385

We study a non-additive binary mixture which is annealed with different cooling rates from the liquid phase to a low temperature well below the glass transition. The thermal treatment is applied by repeatedly heating and cooling the system at constant pressure, thus temporarily inducing internal stresses upon thermal expansion. We find that poorly annealed glasses are relocated to progressively lower levels of potential energy over consecutive cycles, whereas well annealed glasses can be rejuvenated at sufficiently large amplitudes of thermal cycling. Moreover, the lowest levels of potential energy after one hundred cycles are detected at a certain temperature amplitude for all cooling rates. The structural transition to different energy states is accompanied by collective nonaffine displacements of atoms that are organized into clusters, whose typical size becomes larger with increasing cooling rate or temperature amplitude. We show that the elastic modulus and the peak value of the stress overshoot exhibit distinct maxima at the cycling amplitude, which corresponds to the minimum of the potential energy. The simulation results indicate that the yielding peak as a function of the cycling amplitude for quickly annealed glasses represents a lower bound for the maximum stress in glasses prepared with lower cooling rates. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Deformation; Glasses; Molecular dynamics simulations; Temperature; Yield stress","Annealing; Binary mixtures; Cooling; Deformation; Glass transition; Mechanical properties; Metallic glass; Molecular dynamics; Molecular physics; Potential energy; Temperature; Thermal cycling; Thermal expansion; Yield stress; Constant pressures; Heating and cooling; Large amplitude; Low temperatures; Molecular dynamics simulations; Stress overshoot; Structural transitions; Temperature amplitude; Glass","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054524842

Experiment 1, with short sentences, showed the standard font-size effect on JOLs, and Experiment 2, with pairs of longer sentences, showed a reduced effect. These results suggest that linguistic factors do not prevent font size from being used for JOLs. However, Experiment 3, with both short and long sentences, showed an effect of font size only for the former and not the latter condition, suggesting that the greater amount of to-be-remembered information eliminated the font-size effect. In Experiment 4, we tested a mechanism to explain this result and manipulated cognitive load using the dot-memory task. The short sentences from Experiments 1 and 3 were used, and the results replicated the font-size effect only in the low-cognitive load condition.

Higher resolution estimates are required for robust agricultural assessments at regional and local scales, where the applicability of GGCMs is often limited by low data availability and high computational demand. An approach to bridge this gap is the application of meta-models trained on GGCM output data to covariates of high spatial resolution. In this study, we explore two machine learning approaches – extreme gradient boosting and random forests - to develop meta-models for the prediction of crop model outputs at fine spatial resolutions. Machine learning algorithms are trained on global scale maize simulations of a GGCM and exemplary applied to the extent of Mexico at a finer spatial resolution. Results show very high accuracy with R2&gt;0.96 for predictions of maize yields as well as the hydrologic externalities evapotranspiration and crop available water with also low mean bias in all cases. While limited sets of covariates such as annual climate data alone provide satisfactory results already, a comprehensive set of predictors covering annual, growing season, and monthly climate data is required to obtain high performance in reproducing climate-driven inter-annual crop yield variability.

It is widely believed, but unfortunately up to now unproven, that there are sets in EXP NP, or even in EXP that are not computable by polynomial size circuits and hence are not reducible to a sparse set. In this paper we study this question in a more restricted setting: what is the computational complexity of sparse sets that are selfreducible? It follows from earlier work of Lozano and Torán (in: Mathematical systems theory, 1991) that EXP NP does not have sparse selfreducible hard sets. We define a natural version of selfreduction, tree-selfreducibility, and show that NEXP does not have sparse tree-selfreducible hard sets. We also construct an oracle relative to which all of EXP is reducible to a sparse tree-selfreducible set. These lower bounds are corollaries of more general results about the computational complexity of sparse sets that are selfreducible, and can be interpreted as super-polynomial circuit lower bounds for NEXP. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Computational complexity; Selfreducibility; Sparseness","Computational complexity; Polynomial approximation; Circuit lower bounds; Mathematical systems theories; Polynomial size; Polynomial-time; Self-reducible sets; Selfreducibility; Sparseness; Super-polynomials; Forestry","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048747005

The consideration is given to porous systems in the limit of low porosity. The initial ensembles of pores are comprised of multiple pores with small sizes, which are approximately normally distributed. As periodic loading proceeds, the ensembles evolve into configurations with a few large-scale voids and significantly reduced number of small pores. These structural changes are reflected in skewed shapes of the pore-size distribution functions and the appearance of a distinct peak at large length scales after hundreds of shear cycles. Moreover, periodic shear causes substantial densification of solid domains in the porous systems. The structural evolution of pore ensembles is found to stem from the formation of shear band like regions of enhanced particle mobility after a number of transient cycles. The spatial extent of regions with increased atomic mobility depends strongly on the strain amplitude. A simple theoretical model is developed to qualitatively describe the transformation of the initial configurations of small-size voids into larger-scale void agglomerates. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.","deformation; glasses; molecular dynamics simulations; porous structure","Deformation; Distribution functions; Glass; Molecular dynamics; Normal distribution; Atomistic simulations; Initial configuration; Molecular dynamics simulations; Periodic deformation; Porous structures; Structural evolution; Structural transformation; Theoretical modeling; Pore size","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062908193

We demonstrate that the character of smearing of the singularities crucially depends on the concentration of impurities. There is a crossover concentration nc λ|,λ 1 being the dimensionless amplitude of scattering. For nnc, the singularities are simply rounded at ≡E-EN∼τ-1 - the Born scattering rate. For nnc, the single-impurity non-Born effects in scattering become essential despite λ 1. The peak of the resistivity is asymmetrically split in a Fano-resonance manner (however, with a more complex structure). Namely, for >0, there is a broad maximum at λ2, while for <0, there is a deep minimum at || n2 λ2. The behavior of ρ below the minimum depends on the sign of λ. In case of repulsion, ρ monotonically grows with || and saturates for || λ2. In case of attraction, ρ has a sharp maximum at || λ2. The latter feature is due to resonant scattering at quasistationary bound states that inevitably arise just below the bottom of each subband for any attracting impurity. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059892640

In recent years, much work has been done to identify how the brain uses and computes this signal. While several lines of evidence suggest the interplay of the DA and the inhibitory interneurons in the VTA implements the RPE computation, it still remains unclear how the DA neurons learn key quantities, for example the amplitude and the timing of primary rewards during conditioning tasks. Furthermore, endogenous acetylcholine and exogenous nicotine, also likely affect these computations by acting on both VTA DA and GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) neurons via nicotinic-acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). To explore the potential circuit-level mechanisms for RPE computations during classical-conditioning tasks, we developed a minimal computational model of the VTA circuitry. The model was designed to account for several reward-related properties of VTA afferents and recent findings on VTA GABA neuron dynamics during conditioning. With our minimal model, we showed that the RPE can be learned by a two-speed process computing reward timing and magnitude. By including models of nAChR-mediated currents in the VTA DA-GABA circuit, we showed that nicotine should reduce the acetylcholine action on the VTA GABA neurons by receptor desensitization and potentially boost DA responses to reward-related signals in a non-trivial manner. Together, our results delineate the mechanisms by which RPE are computed in the brain, and suggest a hypothesis on nicotine-mediated effects on reward-related perception and decision-making. © 2019 Deperrois, Moiseeva and Gutkin.","Acetylcholine; Dopamine; Nicotine; Reward-prediction error; Ventral tegmental area","acetylcholine; nicotine; nicotinic receptor; acetylcholine release; Article; brain nerve cell; conditioning; connectome; dopamine release; dopaminergic nerve cell; dopaminergic system; GABAergic system; human; mathematical computing; neuromodulation; prediction; receptor down regulation; reward; time factor; velocity; ventral tegmentum","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060658044

We consider the critical point of the Anderson transition and the delocalized phase. In the delocalized phase near the transition point, the observables show a broad critical regime for system sizes N below the correlation volume Nξ and then cross over to the ergodic behavior. Eigenstate correlations allow us to visualize the correlation length ξ∼lnNξ that controls the finite-size scaling near the transition. The critical-to-ergodic crossover is very peculiar, since the critical point is similar to the localized phase, whereas the ergodic regime is characterized by very fast ""diffusion,"" which is similar to the ballistic transport. In particular, the return probability crosses over from a logarithmically slow variation with time in the critical regime to an exponentially fast decay in the ergodic regime. Spectral correlations in the delocalized phase near the transition are characterized by level number variance Σ2(ω) crossing over, with increasing frequency ω, from ergodic behavior Σ2=2/π2lnω/Δ to Σ2 ω2 at ωc∼(NNξ)-1/2 and finally to Poissonian behavior Σ2=ω/Δ at ωξ∼Nξ-1. We find a perfect agreement between results of exact diagonalization and those resulting from the solution of the self-consistency equation obtained within the saddle-point analysis of the effective supersymmetric action. We show that the RRG model can be viewed as an intricate d→∞ limit of the Anderson model in d spatial dimensions. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059884732

We propose to interpret the current Russian media system in terms of institutional conflict between norms, which were artificially implemented and the grounded informal rules embodied in everyday practices both from market agents and audiences. Mainly implemented after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the norms were based on a neo-liberal representation of the media system, involving financial independence of the media from the state, a ‘news culture’ instead of a ‘propaganda culture’ and so on.

The region in the Siberian Far East, better known by the name of its main town, Birobidzhan, never turned into what it was supposed to be, namely the centre of Jewish life in the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, while being demographically and culturally insignificant, the low-statused JAR played a key and essentially detrimental role in determining the entitlements that the Jews had in the Soviet pecking order. The government consistently used the Birobidzhan-centered model of Jewish life as an instrument for justifying internationally its active assimilationist policy. In the 1950s, rumours–first about the liquidation of Jewish autonomy and then about a planned expulsion of Jews to the JAR–attracted the attention and concern of the foreign press and Jewish organizations. International pressure forced Moscow to modify its Jews-related policy, but changed little in the JAR. The 1959 census revealed 14,269 Jews in the JAR’s population. Compared with 1939, the number of Jews in the region had decreased almost by a fifth.

The analysis concludes that there is no noticeable progress in the development of these mechanisms. Special attention is given to the current transformation determined by involvement of private organizations into provision of socio-cultural services, particularly NGOs. Two possible ways of conducting such transformation are pointed out: decentralized (that takes place today), when the transformation is carried out relatively independently by sectors of the social sphere and the subjects of the Russian Federations and ""centralized"" transformation, when it is carried out on the basis of rules established at the federal level that are uniform for all branches of the social sphere, as well as regions and municipalities.

However, researches have not treated SRL in much detail. The research was conducted in 24 MOOCs offered by National Research University Higher School of Economics on the National Platform Open Education in 2017.

In this paper, a more detailed approach to access the association between SRL and educational outcomes of MOOCs learners was implemented.

On the average social media users tend to experience more positive attitude to the ethnic groups they belong to, but there are some exceptions—Russians and Tatars. Gender also influence the attitude insofar as men expressed stronger negative emotions toward foreign peoples. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Ethnicity; Out-group bias; Russia; Social media; Stereotypes","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Ethnicity; Out-group bias; Russia; Social media; Stereotypes; Social networking (online)","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065337699

The first goal of this study was to estimate the effect of phonological processing on number recognition and math performance during the first year of schooling, controlling for reading achievement. The second goal was to examine whether this effect varied for boys and girls. To achieve these goals, we used a large sample of first-graders (N = 3296, 49% were girls) in Russia and applied fixed effects longitudinal analysis. Participants were assessed twice, at the beginning and at the end of the first grade (mean age was 7.3 years at Time 1). The item response theory scaling procedure was used to estimate individual scores for math performance, number recognition, phonological processing and reading performance. The results revealed that phonological processing had effects on number recognition and math performance. This effect was more salient for number recognition than for math performance, probably due to the greater involvement of the retrieval strategy in number recognition tasks.

We propose to overcome these drawbacks by replacing the exponential activation function in the Gaussian kernel to the complex exponential functions. Such complex nonlinearities make it possible to accurately approximate the unknown density function using the network with the number of neurons proportional to only cubic root of the database size. As a result, the proposed approach decreases the runtime and memory complexities of the PNN without losing its main advantages, namely, fast training and convergence to the Bayesian decision. In the experimental study, we describe a protocol for comparing recognition methods using the well-known visual object category data sets in the context of the small sample size problem.

At the core of this experiment was the new concept of Labor Unions as a form of intermediate democracy which could potentially be transformed into a communal state based on the collective production and distribution of property, wealth, and social responsibility between broad nets of workers unions. In the sociological literature and international historiography, this social experiment was scrutinized as a rare or even unique historical example of how the abstract syndical concept of a stateless society (based on cooperation and solidarity rather than on bureaucratic control) could be put into reality. This form of self-government was interpreted as a substantive historical alternative to the traditional ""bourgeois"" state with its key institutions - parliamentarianism, the separation of powers and an independent judicial system. In some current left-oriented theories, this is considered a ""model"" experiment - successful, consecutive and effective in its initial stage (in the period of the so-called ""War Communism"" in 1918-20), but revised and finally rejected in the following period of bureaucratic Communism with its one-party hegemony and Stalinist dictatorship. In order to understand the scientific value of such statements, the author provides a detailed analysis of the principles, initial forms and implications of Soviet labor self-government in the early formation period (1918), using multiple primary sources - the minutes and protocols of central and local labor unions, the old and the new ones, which depict the social, professional, and administrative stratification of Russian revolutionary society during its formation. The author's central argument is that the so-called deterioration of labor selfgovernment in Soviet Russia was rooted mainly in the internal transformation of unions as formal organizations rather than external pressure or strategic mistakes. From the very beginning the revolutionary labor unions were different from the typical Western social democratic unions - they had a different, more traditional, social background, and sought a different role in social transformation. A combination of internal and external factors in this transformation created the institutional basis for a new type of social inequality, the development of oligarchic trends in Soviet labor unions, and the formation of a new ""labor bureaucracy"". The Bolshevist party exploited these trends but did not generate them. In other words, the whole experiment in workers' democracy from its very beginning was profoundly unrealizable and belongs to the museum of human utopian social projects. © HSE, 1992-2018.Утопическая идея государства рабочих, приведенная в действие в России после захва- та большевиками власти в 1917 г., породила новые типы социальной мобилизации, адап- тации, доминирования и политических институтов. Сердцевину этого эксперимента составляла концепция профсоюзов как формы непосредственной демократии, которая потенциально могла трансформироваться в форму Государства-Коммуны, основанную на самоуправлении, коллективном производстве и распределении собственности, благ, со- циальной ответственности между широким спектром рабочих союзов. В социологической литературе и огромной интернациональной историографии русской революции этот социальный эксперимент всегда являлся предметом тщатель- ного анализа как редкий, даже уникальный, исторический пример осуществления аб- страктной синдикалистской концепции бесклассового общества - нового социального контракта, основанного на кооперации и солидарности, а не на бюрократическом кон- троле. Эта форма правления интерпретировалась как содержательная историческая альтернатива традиционному буржуазному государству с такими его главными ин- ститутами, как парламентаризм, разделение властей и независимая судебная система. В некоторых современных левых теориях этот эксперимент выступает как модель- ный - успешный, последовательный и эффективный на начальной стадии (в период так называемого военного коммунизма 1918-1920 гг.), но пересмотренный и окончательно отвергнутый в последующий период бюрократического коммунизма - однопартийной гегемонии и сталинской диктатуры. Чтобы оценить научную ценность подобных ут- верждений, автор провел детальный анализ принципов, исходных форм и результатов рабочего самоуправления в период его непосредственного формирования (1918 г.), ос- нованный на изучении многочисленных и ценных первичных источников - стенограмм и протоколов центральных и местных профсоюзов (старых и новых), представляющих социальную, профессиональную и административную стратификацию русского револю- ционного общества в процессе его формирования. Центральный пункт авторской аргументации состоит в том, что так называемая деградация рабочего самоуправления в Советской России коренилась скорее во внутренней трансформации союзов, нежели во внешнем давлении на них или стратегических ошибках. С самого начала революционные профсоюзы не были аналогами регулярных социал-демо- кратических профсоюзов западного типа, они имели иное, более традиционное социаль- ное происхождение, играли другую роль в социальной трансформации. Комбинация вну- тренних и внешних факторов этой трансформации создала институциональные основы для формирования нового социального неравенства, развития олигархических тенденций в советских профсоюзах и новой трудовой бюрократии. Большевистская партия просто использовала, формализовала и направила этот тренд, но не она его создала. Это озна- чает, что весь эксперимент по конструированию рабочей демократии как новой формы управления изначально оказался фундаментально нереализуем и должен быть отправлен в музей всех утопических проектов человечества.","Anarchism; Bureaucracy; Communism; Deviations; Hierarchy; Labor conflicts; Labor unions; Masses and leaders; Oligarchy; Protest; Repressions; Russian revolution; Social mobilization; Social stratification; Social utopia; Syndicalism; Workers' democracy; Анархизм; Бюрократия; Иерархия; Коммунизм; Массы и лидеры; Олигархия; Отклоняющееся поведение; Протест; Рабочая демократия; Русская революция; Синдикализм; Со- циальная утопия; Социальная мобили- зация; Социальная стратификация; Трудовые конфликты",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065092776

Plato is well known for his critics of magicians in the Republic and the Laws yet picturing Socrates as a magician and enchanter in other dialogues. I will address this apparent inconsistency by examining pharmakon (drug) and epode (incantation) as two magical terms that we know already from pre-platonic texts, while in the dialogues Plato uses them for depicting a variety of Socratic philosophical practices: in the Charmides Socrates presented as a follower of Thracian medical-magical practitioner, in the Theaetetus he appears as a midwife of the souls, in the Phaedo as a prophet and a servant of Apollo and in the Republic as a lover of poetry who places his own incantation in opposition to poetry's mimetic charm. As it follows, the magic of Socrates is a counter-magic to the bewitchment andjugglery of a sophistry and mimetic poetry. By enchanting pharmakon with epode Socrates neutralizes the risk of pharmakon being dangerous drug: a model for a method that Socrates is famed for yet expressed in the words of magic. © 2019 Center for Ancient Philosophy and the Classical Tradition.

The purpose of current research is to uncover the US influence on the Canadian pharmaceutical industry insertion into global value chains. The first part of the analysis is devoted to key trends of the US and Canadian pharmaceutical industries development under the expansion of global value chains. As a result, the following hypotheses are investigated: (1) Canada’s participation in pharmaceutical value chains is mostly regional other than global; (2) Canada’s regional value added is primarily generated through cooperation with the US pharmaceutical sector; (3) dominant positions of the US corporations on the world as well as Canadian pharmaceutical markets stifle Canada’s integration into global value chains. The second part of the research describes the quantitative approach to the hypotheses testing. For instance, data from the World Input-Output Database is used to calculate the origin of value added based on the geography and product type (national and foreign value added in the exports of final and intermediate goods). The final part of the paper deals with the data interpretation and contains conclusions. Namely, it was found that pharmaceutical GVCs in North America are in fact regional for most countries and Canada is not the exception (first hypothesis proved). Further, foreign value added content of Canadian pharmaceutical exports is primarily generated in the US (second hypothesis proved). At the same time, the last hypothesis has not gained support in current research. The share of foreign value added growth during the period of 2002–2014.

In directly posing the question of what ANT is and what it means to be an actor-network theorist, the author shows that this, first of all, means writing specific texts. If we accept such a version of what ANT is, then the question is how Latour proposes to write texts. His strategy of description is based on a certain politics of explanation. Like any other politics, the politics of explanation is based on certain principles or credo; in this case, these principles are related to the influence of the semiotics, ethnomethodology, and results of what Latour called the anthropology of the modern. This text, on the one hand, analyzes how Latour selectively borrows elements of semiotics and ethnomethodology in developing his policy of explanation. On the other hand, the author shows how this politics of explanation is implemented in practice in a specific description strategy. The author concludes that Latour's politics of explanation and the subsequent description strategy presupposes an average path between two extremes. The first extreme is the output to the meta level, and the second is the use of only the explanations of the actors themselves. This middle path consists of the development of certain principles of description that would not lead either to the replacement of the language of actors by the language of a sociologist, or to a simple repetition of the language of actors. The ANT infra-language does not say anything meaningful about the world, but, in a certain way, organizes a description of the world as it is as an empty template which must be re-applied each time. It is for this reason that it is possible for historical, ethnographic, and mixed ANT-research. © 2019.Статья представляет собой попытку интерпретации акторно-сетевой теории (ANT) Бруно Латура как записывающего устройства или, иными словами, как способа перевода мира в текстовую форму. Задаваясь вопросом о том, что значит быть акторно-сетевым теоретиком, автор показывает, что это в первую очередь означает писать специфические тексты. Если принять подобную версию того, чем является ANT, то на первый план выходит вопрос: как именно Латур предлагает нечто описывать? Его способ описания опирается на некоторую политику объяснения, которая, как и любая другая политика, строится на определенных принципах или кредо; в данном случае эти принципы связаны с влиянием семиотики и этнометодологии, а также результатами, что Латур назвал «антропологией нововременных». В данном тексте сначала анализируется, как Латур избирательно заимствует некоторые элементы семиотики и этнометодологии, разрабатывая свою политику объяснения. Затем показано, как эта политика объяснения реализуется на практике в определенной стратегии описания. Автор приходит к выводу, что политика объяснения Латура и базирующаяся на ней стратегия описания предполагает средний путь между тем, чтобы выходить на метауровень, объясняя нечто, и тем, чтобы использовать только объяснения самих акторов. Этот средний путь состоит в разработке некоторых принципов описания, которые не приводили бы ни к замене языка акторов языком социолога, ни к простому повторению языка акторов. Инфра-язык ANT содержательно ничего не говорит о мире, но определенным образом организует описание мира; это пустой шаблон, на который каждый раз необходимо заново наносить карту местности. Именно поэтому возможно и историческое, и этнографическое, и смешанное исследование в духе ANT.","Actor-network theory; Bruno Latour; Description; Explanation; Infra-reflexivity; Modes of existence; Science and technology studies; Акторно-сетевая теория; Бруно Латур; Инфрарефлексивность; Исследования науки и технологий; Объяснение; Описание; Режимы существования",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064953988

Vasilyuk is the flesh of the flesh of its creator who was an individual of the pervasive active empathy. Vasilyuk's system of views is 'sensitive' to other systems; it is empathically attuned to them, and it carefully re-endows them with understanding. Vasilyuk, who described the schism between two- research and practical - psychologies, did not limit himself to the statement. In developing his psychology, he goes beyond the boundaries of his own 'understanding psychotherapy' by denoting and visualizing the diverse connections that unite science and practice. But researchers, venturing beyond the limits of a particular psychological theory, are required to seek the most common supports to construct integral models. From this perspective we consider here the category of sensation that possesses a deceptive simplicity, and note the role it plays in order to comprehend the essence of experience, the central concept in Vasilyuk's theory, as well as in order to solve the problem of integration. While pointing out the existence of impersonal sensations that are not related to the I, we define experience as a sensation that is present in the I. Therefore, experience as an activity is bidirectional: it can 'introduce' sensations into the composition of the I, and 'bring' them beyond the limits of the I. Different forms of the I are described as 'dwelling places' of sensations with the status of experiences. © 2019 Moscow State University of Psychology & Education.«Понимающая психотерапия» Ф.Е. Василюка - плоть от плоти ее создателя, человека всепрони- кающей деятельной эмпатии. Система взглядов Василюка «чувствительна» к другим системам, эм- патически сонастроена с ними, бережно возвращает им свое понимание. Василюк, описавший схизис двух психологий, научной и практической, не ограничился констатацией. Строя свою психологию, он выходит за границы собственной «понимающей психотерапии», обозначая и визуализируя многооб- разные скрепы, объединяющие науку и практику. Но выход за пределы частной психологической те- ории требует от исследователей поиска наиболее общих опор для построения интегральных моделей. С этих позиций мы рассматриваем здесь обманчивой простоты категорию «ощущение», отмечая ее зна- чимость для уяснения сути центрального понятия «переживание» в теории Василюка, а также - для решения задачи интеграции.

However, another block of causes of death, event of undetermined intent shows the same rapid growth and since 2014 already exceeds the cumulative death rate from homicides and suicides. Researchers believe this block of causes is a reservoir of latent homicides and suicides. As a result, actual data on homicides and suicides are underestimated. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that regional practices of coding the causes of death can largely deform the structure of mortality, which is why the ordinary proportional redistribution of event of undetermined intent within the class ""External causes of morbidity and mortality"" ICD-10 is not enough. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the actual death rates from homicides and suicides using a model region in which the proportion of event of undetermined intent is minimal. Three options for solving this problem are proposed. The suicide rate increased by 30% regardless of the hypothesis. At the same time, the level of homicides and accidents increased most significantly under the third hypothesis, when all cases of events of undetermined intent were redistributed - there was an increase of 30% compared to 15-20% for the first hypothesis. Assessment for regions, depending on the accepted hypothesis of redistribution of events of undetermined intent, showed differences, demonstrating an underestimation of specific causes of death. In some regions, ill-defined causes are used mainly to hide deaths from suicide (for example, Astrakhan, Samara, Sakhalin and Samara regions, as well as Tuva), and in other regions to conceal homicides (Orel and Vologda regions, Bashkortostan). © 2019 Russian Academy of Sciences.

The principles of the formation and activity of the Tashkent City Duma provoked contradictory opinions among contemporaries and later researcher. The author aims to analyse the terms of the development of local government in Tashkent, its correspondence with imperial principles and specific local features (based on centuries-old traditions of local government in Central Asia), and the evaluations of the adherents and opponents of Kaufmann's project. In order to achieve this goal, the author studies the position of the Turkestan governorgeneral, the legal institutions of local government in the Russian Empire in general and in Turkestan in particular, and opinions of contemporaries, i. e. Russian imperial officials, representatives of the Turkestan administration, and members of the Tashkent City Duma. Additionally, the author refers to works by Soviet, Russian, and foreign scholars in the 20th and early 21st centuries. The most criticised aspects of the reform are the disproportional representation in the City Duma of ""Russian"" and ""indigenous"" parts of the Tashkent population, the active intervention of the governor-general in the activity of the Duma, and his freedom in spending municipal funds on projects outside the competence of the local government. The author establishes that von Kaufmann's reform was a declarative imitation in Tashkent of reforms implemented in European Russia. At the same time, he considered the City Duma an additional instrument for the realisation of his own projects in Tashkent and the Turkestan region in general, which was reflected in his Regulations, an ""adaptation"" of the City Code of 1870 to Central Asian realities. As a result, it is not surprising that the organisation and activity of the Tashkent City Duma during Kaufmann's rule in Turkestan was criticised not only by central officials (who reacted negatively to Kaufmann's activity from the very beginning), but also by the representatives of the Turkestan administration who had deep respect for Kaufmann. © 2019 Ural Federal University.

The authors conclude that the initiatives of international organizations in the global regulation of e-commerce are far behind business practices. Despite the dynamic development of the digital economy, international institutions have not yet been able to work out control mechanisms at the multilateral level. Therefore, today the WTO and a number of other international organizations are facing the need to develop new mechanisms for regulating trade in the conditions of digitalization. This will largely depend not only on the new rules of trade policy, but also on the future of these organizations, their placement in the hierarchy of influence of international institutions. The article shows that countries manage to regulate various aspects of e-commerce more comprehensively at the bilateral and plural lateral levels. The use of digital trade regulations developed at the regional and plurilateral levels, as well as the cooperation of countries at other sites (APEC, OECD, the G20), may facilitate the creation of future WTO agreements governing digital trade. © 1993-2019.Международная торговля постоянно развивается, что приводит к необходимости выработки адекват- ных ответов со стороны международных экономических институтов, участвующих в ее регулировании.

Несмотря на динамичное развитие цифровой экономики, международным институтам пока не удается выработать механизмы контроля на многостороннем уровне за отдельными ее элементами. Поэтому сегодня ВТО и ряду других организаций необходимо выработать новые механизмы для регулирования торговли в условиях цифровизации.

Использование положений о цифровой тор- говле, разрабатываемых в рамках региональных торговых соглашений и в плюрилатеральном формате, а также сотрудничество стран на других площадках (АТЭС, ОЭСР, «Группе двадцати») может оказать содействие в создании будущих соглашений ВТО, регулирующих цифровую торговлю.","Digital trade; E-commerce; Global governance; International economic organizations; World Trade Organization; Всемирная торговая организация; Глобальное управление; Международные экономические организации; цифровая торговля; Электронная коммерция",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064757314

The article also examines the modernization of technology for making packaging as well as technology transfer from the West. It concludes that, as in many Western countries, both the Soviet state and Soviet specialists saw it as important to increase the consumption of milk after the war, but the meaning of milk changed. Milk, a basic staple for nutrition, became a matter of science and specialists sought to explain its positive effects. In addition, due to the development of the paper and chemical industries, new forms of milk packaging, more practical in their uses, were introduced in the West. Soviet leaders and specialists saw the new packaging as a desirable feature of modernity, but were unsuccessful in launching domestic technologies for manufacturing such packaging. While experimenting with domestic technology, Soviet producers also received foreign equipment for making milk packaging. Nevertheless, the capacity of such foreign equipment was not enough to satisfy growing demand and the consumption of ""modern packaging"" remained lower than in the West until the introduction of capitalism and, with it, foreign companies into the Russian market in the 1990s. © 2019 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Cold War; consumption; milk; modernity; packaging; Soviet; technology",,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064351745

They can be linked to such texts as the three lectures “What is an Author?” (first phase), “What is Critique?,” and “What is Revolution?” (second phase), and the two lecture courses, “Fearless Speech,” and “The Courage of Truth” (third phase). Initially, Foucault merely describes the founders of discursivity (hence, “superauthors”), among whom he reckoned only Marx and Freud, as the sole alternative to his own conceptualization of the author function, which is exhibited en masse in contemporary society. He then modifies his views on superauthorship by making Kant the paradigm and by linking his own concept of free speech to a Kantian critical attitude. However, Foucault claims only the half of Kant’s philosophical legacy that is related to the study of the ontology of the self. The article advances the hypothesis that the sovereign power of speech, which can be found in Marx and Heidegger and in generally in the concept of “superau-thorship,” becomes unacceptable for Foucault. During the third phase, the danger of a tyrannical use of free speech compels Foucault to make a number of fruitful but questionable choices in his work. He focuses on a single aspect of free speech in which a speaker is in a weaker position and therefore has to overcome his fear in order to tell the truth. Foucault associates this kind of free speech with the ancient Greek notion of parrhesia, which according to his interpretation means “fearless speech”; however, this reading is not always supported by the ancient Greek sources. Foucault’s deliberations bring him to the radical conclusion that free speech transforms into performative “aesthetics of existence.” Foucault’s main motivation for pursuing this line of thought all through his life was to investigate his own abilities and powers as an author. © 2019, Gaidar Institute Press.

It has become one of the key concepts in the social sciences. Those terms both refer to the novel perspective that Foucault arrived at to understand and analyze the phenomenon of power or, more specifically, various types of power relations typical of different cultures and political communities. Over the past several decades, that perspective has provided the methodological basis for an emerging interdisciplinary field called Governmentality Studies in the English-language social sciences. One purpose of this approach is to reassess the genealogy and specific features of modern societies and modern states without conceptualizing “power” through the “state” as traditional political philosophy has done. However, contemporary social science in Russia has largely been deprived of the opportunity to use Foucault’s conceptual instruments and research methods because of problems with translation among other barriers. The article 1) summarizes the Foucauldian critique and analysis of power embedded in the concept of gouvernementalité and compares that approach with traditional paradigms in political philosophy, 2) highlights how that concept has been used over the years in Foucault’s works dealing with power relations and the topic of the ethical subject, 3) demonstrates that current Russian translations of Foucault’s primary texts incorporating the term gouvernementalité are not merely imprecise, but exemplify what the French call contresens interpretations that directly contradict the essence of the original.

The topic of converting human capital into relevant material indicators described in economical terms is yet to be sufficiently developed; thus, it is necessary to identify key factors that influence the educational activity of working citizens and to establish the role of the Adult Education and Vocational Education and Trainings (AE&VET) in the macroeconomic development of regions. Using statistical analysis the authors established a correlation between the supplementary education’s rate and the volume of fixed capital investment per capita in the Russian Federation regions, which indicated the importance of investments in education and personnel training: in the regions with growing volume of investments, the amount of grown population who continue education in order to implement their knowledge at new enterprises is also increasing. This, in turn, boosts the investment appeal of the territory. The authors confirmed the hypothesis that investments in educational programs lead to the increase in labour productivity; this phenomenon has a positive impact on the growth rates of both wages and gross regional product. Thus, it was concluded that socio-economic differentiation of subjects of the Russian Federation is directly related to the general indicators of the regional AE&VET systems. Effective development of AE&VET requires active participation of all stakeholders (workers, employers, investors, regional authorities, and the government). The main provisions and conclusions of the article can be used for development of the regional AE&VET-systems for ensuring the economic growth as well as the investment appeal of the territory. © 2019 The Linguistic Association of Finland.

In July 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave a speech at the Council on Inter-ethnic Relations, addressing the language rights of the Russian-speaking population and stressing the existing limit of the power of Russia's 22 ethnic republics to introduce compulsory study of their official languages. The President's statements provoked widespread prosecutorial inspections in the republics' schools and a new round of public discussion about language policy. Public discontent in Tatarstan, Bashkortostan and Komi led to protests against both ethnic Russians and the native speakers of languages recognised as co-official with Russian ('state languages of the republics'). The authorities of some republics publicly disagreed with the position taken by the federal government. In other republics, however, the President's speech did not trigger any public discussion. In many republics, it looks like the regional authorities will ultimately accept the decision of the federal government and speakers of republican languages will not actively defend their languages.

Using a newly developed dataset for 34 industries covering the period 1995–2012 and applying three alternative approaches, aggregate labor productivity growth is decomposed into intra-industry and inter-industry contributions. All three approaches show that the overall contribution of structural change is growth enhancing, significant, and decreasing over time.

To this end, a text from a popular men’s online magazine was analyzed in terms of its lexicogrammatical properties. The text is an instance of fashion/style advice ubiquitous in lifestyle media, and discusses several rules that a man in his thirties is highly recommended to follow. The analysis draws on a theoretical framework, primarily associated with Fairclough’s version of Discourse Analysis, where genre and discourse are seen as two complementary categories informing two sets of textual meanings – actional and representational respectively. It is contended that one distinctive variation of the LI are texts that draw, as it were, on the instructive generic “form” and consumerist discourse “content”. Methodologically, the study relies on the analysis of the text’s schematic structure, its patterns of transitivity, as well as the analysis of presuppositions, and attitudinal and stance-taking locutions. Results of the analysis show that, as regards actional meanings, the most salient features of the text in question and similar texts found in lifestyle media are their well-defined generic structure and sentence speech function. The text starts with an introduction, which is then followed by several numbered paragraphs. Each paragraph instantiates an almost identical pattern of semantic relations and comprises a descriptive, motivational, and instructive phase. The most salient speech function used in the text is that of demand, which is realized either (congruently) by the imperative or (incongruently) by the declarative mood. Both these features and the tentative communicative purposes of the LI can be traced back to more traditional types of instructions. In terms of representational meanings, this and similar texts arguably draw on consumerist discourse. This is primarily manifested in ways the “appropriate” identity of a man in his thirties is constructed vis-à-vis consumer goods. Lexicogrammatically, the first participant of most processes is the addressee. This makes the addressee the main social subject of the practices referenced by the text, with consumer products being positioned as indispensable tools for the realization of these practices and enactment of the identity. Important resources in such positioning are attitudinal locutions, which are primarily used to evaluate consumer goods as “befitting” the referenced identity. The results contribute to the exploration of contemporary (Internet) genres in terms of linguistic features, the study of contextual embeddedness of genres, and the role of discourse in social practices at large. Specifically, the actional textual features can be seen as primarily reflecting the professional practice of lifestyle journalism with its distinctive set of communicative goals, while the representational features may be seen as manifestations of consumer culture and the role it plays in shaping people’s identities in today’s world. © 2019 Tomsk State University.

Moreover, the rise of China has resulted in international pressure on Beijing to take more responsibility in addressing international refugee crises. In order to understand how China responds to these new challenges and external pressures, this paper asks the following questions: What is the legal and institutional framework of China's refugee policy? Are there contradictions between international refugee protection regime commitments and China's treatment of refugees? How does China contribute to burden-sharing initiatives? Does Beijing try to challenge the existing regime and promote alternative norms? The introductory part of the article outlines the main features of the international refugee protection regime: major legal acts, norms and institutional framework. In the main part, the author analyzes legislation governing China's policy towards refugees and institutions involved in this process, as well as China's treatment of refugees from different states. The article demonstrates that international law and norms have had an impact on the PRC refugee policy, as Beijing has ratified the Refugee Convention, cooperates with the UNHCR, has successfully resettled and assisted over 250 000 refugees, etc. At the same time, China still violates major principles of the international refugee protection regime, such as non-refoulement, hasn't adopted national refugee legislation, and its contribution to burden-sharing initiatives is much smaller than contributions of the major developed countries.

Studies regarding this issue are based on the supposition that cultural preferences depend on social position and, therefore, reflect social structure. Nevertheless, despite the long history of cultural consumption research and the existence of numerous studies addressing this topic, the notion is still vague. Several approaches may be found in the literature. Cultural consumption is analyzed as a part of lifestyle that is dependent on class structure. This framework is related to the distinction between highbrow and lowbrow activities and tastes, where each set of choices is only relevant for a particular class. Criticism and further development of this approach is related to the reevaluation of both the structure of cultural consumption and the basis for distinction. More recent studies have addressed not only the symbolic value of cultural products but have also looked at the range of cultural preferences and the intensity of cultural activities. Along with this, papers tackling the modes of cultural consumption are also present. However, existing papers vary in terms of employing these approaches. On the one hand, the definitions are different; studies analyze practices, tastes, or experiences. On the other hand, researchers use different variables and scales to measure cultural consumption. © 2019 National Research University Higher School of Economics.

His legacy considers the nature of human mental life, its origin and further development in the process of phylogenesis, anthropogenesis and ontogenesis. In addition, Galperin's contribution was in developing a system of psychological conditions, which enables the formation of mental actions, images and representations with prescribed outcomes. This system is defined as the system of planned stage-by-stage formation of mental actions (PSFMA). Among other applications, PSFMA can be used: i) as a method to study the formation and development of a person's mental activity, ii) to examine the relationship between the theoretically described and objectively occurring in practice the process of systematic formation of mental functions and iii) to design learning and teaching activity aimed at developing 21st century competences. In this paper, I argue, that the direct transfer and application of the mechanisms of PFSMA in classrooms gives satisfactory results only when the conditions of the theoretically planned formation closely correspond to the conditions of real situations in classrooms. In order to bridge the conditions outlined in PFSMA and the real educational practice, it is necessary to carry out several adjustments to account for the complexity of learning. To do so, three models of instructional design are presented in the paper: i) psychological, ii) psychological-pedagogical and iii) procedural or technological model. However, the three-model framework should be considered as an intellectual tool rather than as an algorithm that provides instructions for teachers’ actions. © 2019",,,"English",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060705060

The set of factors and the strength of their influence can differ across countries. There is a lack of research on factors affecting student dishonesty in Russia. A sample of 15,159 undergraduate students from eight Russian highly selective universities was surveyed to understand what factors influence their decision to engage in dishonest behaviour. Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was employed to explain dishonest behaviour among students. The explained variance in the engagement in academic dishonesty equals 48% in the model for the full sample, and reaches 69% in the model for one of the considered institutions. The major findings of this study were: (1) subjective norms appeared to dominate as the strongest predictor of academic dishonesty across the Russian universities; (2) perceived behavioural control, appeared to be positively related to the dishonest behaviour. In the majority of universities, this factor was found to be insignificant. This finding indicates a specific feature of Russian students’ an ethical decision-making process discussed in the last part of the paper. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Academic dishonesty; Russian universities; Theory of planned behaviour; Undergraduate students",,"English",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060011283

The latter appears when the self and the other are thought to be irreconcilably at odds, and the enemy is presented as inferior. In the more extreme cases, this radical othering leads to a dehumanization and demonization of the other, which makes the destruction of the enemy easier.

The state of Bangladesh is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention and does not recognize refugee rights, but the initial experiences with the Rohingya refugee population led the government to create a temporary and ad hoc domestic policy advisory and refugee management system, which eventually became highly politicized. There was also some degree of slow “externalization” of policy advice through the involvement of international organizations from 2006–2007 onward, mainly through the participation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and International Organization for Migration (IOM). Over 2017–2018, there was a massive influx of refugees from Myanmar to Bangladesh. The domestic advisory and refugee management system lacked the capacity to manage the crisis and had to quickly and greatly externalize policy advice and refugee management. The UNHCR and IOM came in with a host of international organizational networks and coordinated with each other and the state through a multi-sectoral approach to manage the crisis. This externalization led to the systematization and institutionalization of the state’s domestic advisory system.

It is the relationship among the contours that determines what is perceived. Note that it is hard to actually compare the perception of such configurations quantitatively. We managed to do this by testing the perception of such configurations in three psychophysical experiments in which the perception was characterized by measuring the orientation threshold of a single contour. This threshold was estimated by using a modified Method of Constant Stimuli based on the assumption that contours forming a configuration are perceived individually, and that they are integrated linearly. This assumption made the quantitative comparison of the perceived configurations possible. We found that changes of the estimated threshold depended on the type of the configuration, specifically thresholds estimated from a perpendicular junction were substantially lower than thresholds estimated from a single contour or from a non-perpendicular junction. The lowest thresholds were observed when the threshold was estimated from a pair of parallel contours. These results suggest that the visual system is sensitive to perpendicular junctions and parallel contours in a retinal image. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Angle discrimination; Contour configuration; Method of Constant Stimuli; Orientation discrimination; Orientation threshold; Parallelism; Perpendicularity","article; human; human experiment; perception; retina image; stimulus; visual system; orientation; pattern recognition; perceptive threshold; physiology; psychological model; psychophysics; Form Perception; Humans; Models, Psychological; Orientation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Psychophysics; Sensory Thresholds","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057252560

We show that the conventional symmetric difference distance between weak orders, considered as sets of ordered pairs, coincides with the celebrated Kemeny distance between the corresponding rankings, despite the seemingly much simpler structure of the former. Based on this, we review several properties of the geometric space of weak orders involving the ternary relation “between,” and contingency tables for cross-partitions. Next, we reformulate the consensus ranking problem as a variant of finding an optimal linear ordering, given a correspondingly defined consensus matrix. The difference is in a subtracted term, the partition concentration that depends only on the distribution of the objects in the individual parts. We apply our results to the conventional Likert scale to show that the Kemeny consensus rule is rather insensitive to the data under consideration and, therefore, should be supplemented with more sensitive consensus schemes. © 2019, The Classification Society.","Consensus; Distance; Muchnik test; Ordered partition; Ranking; Tied ranking; Weak order",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065227106

Since the resurgence in research on values following the introduction of Schwartz's theory of basic values, efforts were focused on identifying universal patterns in value-attitude relations. While some evidence for such universal patterns exists more recent studies point out, there is still considerable variation in value-attitude and value-behavior links across cultures and contexts. Extending the existing literature on potential moderators in this paper we introduce the concept of value-instantiating beliefs. This study looks at subjective construal of the value relevance of specific behaviors as a proximal moderator of value-attitude and value-behavior relations. We argue that a belief that construes a behavior as a valid instantiation of a value is a prerequisite for the relationship between said value and the behavior. We also argue that such value-instantiating beliefs play a central role in determining the direction of the relationship. In a web-based survey experiment (N = 1724) consisting of three trials, we presented participants with vignettes describing behavioral choices. In order to manipulate the value-instantiating beliefs, the behaviors were described either neutrally, as reinforcing the value, or as inhibiting the value. We then measured the value-instantiating beliefs, the attitude towards the behavior, and the intention to perform it. Instantiating beliefs strongly moderated the relationship between the personal values and the dependent variables in all three trials. Moreover, the direction of the relationship was determined by the instantiating beliefs. The results emphasize the plasticity of the value-behavior relation and the role of social construction in directing the motivational power of values towards concrete instantiating behaviors. © 2019 Ponizovskiy, Grigoryan, Kühnen and Boehnke.","Attitudes; Basic human values; Behavior; Construal; Motivation; Social construction; Value instantiation",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065119258

With increasing cycle number, the amplitudes of the volume and potential energy oscillations are significantly reduced, and the potential energy minima saturate to a constant value that depends on the thermal cycling amplitude and the initial cooling rate. In the steady state, the glasses thermally expand and contract but most of the atoms return to their cages after each cycle, similar to limit cycles found in periodically driven amorphous materials.

Some social concepts have completely different interpretations in sociological discourse and everyday life, with the words ""field"" and ""panel"" as good examples. However, the majority of similar concepts of everyday life and sociological research have quite the same content. The word ""justice"" and its derivatives stand out in this set of terms, for hardly any other concept in human history is saturated with political connotations, or requires little additional explanation when used in social-economic debates or military conflicts. As a result, the word ""justice"" is widely used in all ""life-worlds"" (i.e., according to A. Schütz, justice seems to be both a 'first-order construct' and a 'second-order construct'), which complicates its unambiguous conceptual and empirical interpretations in sociological research. The article was supposed to be a review of two books, A History of Justice: From the Pluralism of Forums to the Modern Dualism of Conscience and Law by P. Prodi, and The Idea of Justice by A. Sen, providing a clearer conceptual definition of justice. However, it turned into reflections with some theoretical and empirical examples on why such searches in sociology are important and inevitable, but are unlikely to end with a satisfying result. This does not make such searches meaningless, but rather utopian in nature, and essential for the self-identification of the discipline through the questioning of its own conceptual foundations. © 2019 Russian Sociological Review.Принципиальным отличием социально-гуманитарных дисциплин от технических и естественнонаучных являются частотные пересечения их терминологии с повседневным лексиконом.

Слово «справедливость» так широко используется во всех «жизненных мирах» (оказываясь одновременно конструктом «первого» и «второго порядка» в шютцевской модели), что ему крайне сложно дать однозначное концептуальное и операциональное определение в социологическом исследовании.

Such an idea appears already in Aristotle who offers, however, no good account for it, and only Stobaeus cites an authority, or rather collective authority, the Pythagoreans, for an early recognition of the idea in question. The ancient tradition left no direct evidence of how the sphericity of the sun was recognized, and the issue attracted very little attention in modern scholarship. I propose that in the late sixth century new empirical knowledge about the sun reached the Aegean and Italy. Some people who crossed the northern tropic repeatedly observed the sun from its 'other' side, for in the height of the summer an observer located south of the northern tropic saw the midday sun in the north. This made impossible Anaximander's idea of the sun as a body containing fire and having one aperture and triggered a search for a better version. Since the sun invariably displayed a circular outline at any time, at any place and on all sides of the horizon, one had to consider the possibility that its shape was either spherical or 'bowllike'. The study of lunar light that led to the discovery of the sphericity of the moon was also helpful. The doctrine of a spherical sun was firmly established by the consensus of professional astronomers rather than due to an initiative by an outstanding thinker; however, one may think that Parmenides contributed to it. A spherical sun cannot be a sphere of fire - without a container, fire would have dispersed. This problem brought about a number of theories that treated the sun as a kind of mirror, etc. Further, a spherical sun that issues a reflected light was recognized to have been a solid and hence a heavy body, which contributed to approaching the spheres of the Sun, Moon and Earth in a similar way and making the Earth a planet. © 2019 Center for Ancient Philosophy and the Classical Tradition.

We consider the three-dimensional binary mixture, which was initially cooled with a computationally slow rate from the liquid state to the solid phase at a temperature well below the glass transition. It was found that a cycle of heating and cooling can relocate the glass to either rejuvenated or relaxed states, depending on the maximum temperature and the loading period. Thus, the lowest potential energy is attained after a cycle with the maximum temperature slightly below the glass transition temperature and the effective cooling rate slower than the initial annealing rate. In contrast, the degree of rejuvenation increases when the maximum temperature becomes greater than the glass transition temperature and the loading period is sufficiently small. It was further shown that the variation of the potential energy is inversely related to the dependence of the elastic modulus and the yield stress as functions of the maximum loading temperature.

Today, a modern state needs people capable to regular intensive implementation of innovative activity in order to keep competitiveness in a dynamically changing world that is undergoing a significant increase in the amount of new information and its fast obsolescence. The need of modern economy for innovators inevitably leads to the shift of priorities in education from memorising and reproducing of a specified amount of knowledge to the development of students’ independent thinking, which, accordingly, requires teachers’ certain qualities and critical mentality. The aim of the research was to identify the components of critical thinking important for innovative activity and search for the ways of development of these components in young teachers, entering a master’s programme Modern Natural Science. Methodology and research methods. In the course of the research, the methods of the analysis and synthesis of scientific and scientific-methodological publications devoted to the development of higher order thinking skills and the concept of STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) were employed. The assessment of the level of students’ thinking and its changes was carried out through diagnostic tasks and empirical observation of educational and project-based activity of undergraduates and school students. Results and scientific novelty. The key components of critical thinking for the implementation and realisation of innovative activities were identified: creative, rational, logical, reflexive and metacognitive. To assess the development of components, a set of problem-situational tasks (STEM cases) was developed. Diagnostic tools were introduced to measure the level of critical thinking skills formation. The authors described the methodology for working with STEM cases through the example of the development and presentation of hybrid technology of lifting the sunken ship with a damaged hull, based on the students’ understanding of characteristics of the aggregate state of water. The results of approbation of the presented methodology used in small groups at various educational levels prove that its implementation contributes to the development of critical thinking in students, if the plots of cues are based on real problems of science and technology, and the solution requires contextual use of educational material, building a mathematical model, generating rational ideas of new or improved technologies. Practical significance. The research demonstrates the possibilities of acquisition by students of higher order thinking skills within the studied academic disciplines in the natural-science cycle without introduction of a special course in educational programmes. © 2019 Russian State Vocational Pedagogical University.

Taking advantage of largely exogenous variation in the timing of a survey conducted in Moscow in 2011, we find that with few exceptions the election had little systematic effect on political trust, perhaps because vote improprieties were not new information. In contrast, the unexpected protest that followed increased trust in government. In this case, heightened trust arises largely from opposition voters—those most likely to be surprised by permission to hold the protest—who update their beliefs. We argue that when autocrats permit protest unexpectedly, citizens may update their beliefs about the trustworthiness of the government. Our results suggest that citizens may cue not off the content of a protest but off the government’s decision to permit it.

This article reviews the USSR's initiatives and positions on concrete areas of cooperation, drawing on an analysis of the resolutions and records of the meetings of the UN General Assembly (GA) and the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). It highlights the main trends and cases reflecting the Soviet Union's priorities and its role in the evolution of cooperation for development under UN auspices. Content analysis of meeting records helps to trace the official positions of delegations, problems in advancing cooperation, opportunities for building coalitions, difficulties forging compromises and constraints stemming from the failure to pursue an integrated and comprehensive approach to the resolution of development and international financial/economic problems. The USSR actively contributed to deliberations and decision-making on a wide range of cooperation for development issues, promoting the primacy of the principles of national policy, developing countries' sovereignty over their natural resources and the right of their exploitation, development of countries' economic potential through support for industrialization, technology transfer, agricultural and national cadre development, and the creation of the necessary external conditions for the mobilization of developing countries' own resources. These principles, the pursuit of change in the international balance of economic power and the drive for an expansion of influence defined the Soviet Union's initiatives and its support for developing countries on such issues as global negotiations aimed at the establishment of a new international economic order as proposed by the Group of 77 (G77) - this call was blocked by the Group of 7 (G7) using the Versailles formula to safeguard the independence of the specialized agencies. Inability to allocate substantial amounts of funding significantly weakened the USSR's influence on decisions defining the parameters of development support mechanisms. Telling examples include the failure to promote the establishment of the UN capital development fund or to counter the assertion of the dollar monopoly in the UN cooperation for development system. The solidarity of the USSR and the U.S. with their respective allies frequently led to opposition on issues which did not contradict either of the opponents' interests. A case in point is the struggle around the participation of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in the UN conference on human environment in Stockholm. Distrust and tough opposition caused multiple lost opportunities, including a chance to generate additional resources for development through the conversion of resources released by disarmament to peaceful needs. At the end of the 1990s, following the economic crises of the previous decades, a series of external debt crises and assessment of accumulated data on aid effectiveness and donor fatigue, the principles promoted by the USSR in the first decades of cooperation for development were reflected in the Agenda for Development and the Millennium Declaration. © 1993-2019.Исследование эволюции международного сотрудничества в целях развития под эгидой ООН в период с 1946 по 2000 г. показывает, что политические и идеологические противоречия и приоритеты участников ока- зывали значительное влияние на процесс формирования системы, создавали барьеры в согласовании подхо- дов и решений, становились сдерживающим фактором для прогресса в содействии развитию. Представленное в статье исследование позиций и инициатив СССР по конкретным направлениям сотрудничества опирается на анализ текстов резолюций и официальных отчетов ключевых органов ООН, прежде всего Генеральной Ассамблеи (ГА) и Экономического и Социального Совета ООН (ЭКОСОС). Ос- новная задача работы состояла в том, чтобы проследить тенденции и представить характерные при- меры, которые позволяют читателю сформировать понимание приоритетов и роли СССР в эволюции международного сотрудничества в целях развития под эгидой ООН. Контент-анализ текстов официальных отчетов заседаний ГА позволяет выявить официальные по- зиции делегаций, проблемы выстраивания сотрудничества, возможности формирования коалиций, труд- ности поиска компромиссов и ограничения, связанные с невозможностью реализации интегрированного подхода к решению проблем развития и международных финансовых и экономических вопросов. Анализ показывает, что СССР активно участвовал в формировании решений по содействию разви- тию, продвигая принципы примата национальной политики, неотъемлемого суверенитета развивающихся стран над своими естественными ресурсами и права на их эксплуатацию, развития собственного экономи- ческого потенциала на основе индустриализации и передачи технологий, развития сельского хозяйства и на- циональных кадров, создания внешних условий для мобилизации собственных ресурсов развивающихся стран. Эти принципы, а также стремление изменить расстановку сил в международных экономических отношениях и расширить собственное влияние определяли характер инициатив СССР и поддержку пред- ложений развивающихся стран по таким вопросам как глобальные переговоры, направленные на «создание новой системы международных экономических отношений, основанной на принципах равноправия и взаим- ной выгоды», инициированных Группой 77 и заблокированных «версальской формулой» «Группы семи». Невозможность выделения значительных объемов финансирования существенно ослабляла влияние СССР на решения о формировании инструментов содействия развитию, наглядным примером чего стали нежизнеспособность идеи учреждения Фонда капитального развития ООН и неспособность противосто- ять утверждению монополии доллара в системе развития ООН. Солидарность СССР со своими союзниками, с одной стороны, и США с их партнерами, с другой, зачастую приводила к противостоянию по вопросам, суть которых не противоречила интересам ни той ни другой стороны. Примером является борьба вокруг участия ГДР и ФРГ в Конференции ООН по пробле- мам окружающей человека среды. Недоверие и жесткое противостояние стало причиной многих упущенных возможностей, в том числе привлечения дополнительных ресурсов для реализации задач развития в результате переключения на мирные нужды ресурсов, высвобождаемых в результате разоружения. В конце 90-х годов после экономических кризисов 70-х и 80-х, нескольких кризисов внешней задолжен- ности, анализа данных об эффективности официальной помощи развитию и накопившейся «донорской усталости», принципы, которые СССР продвигал в первые десятилетия содействия развитию, нашли от- ражение в Повестке дня для развития и Декларации тысячелетия Организации Объединенных Наций.","Cooperation for development; ECOSOC; General Assembly; International financial institutions; The UN; the USSR; UNDP; Генеральная Ассамблея; Международные финансовые учреждения; ООН; ПРООН; Сотрудничество для развития; СССР; ЭКОСОС",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064728050

In 2015, England introduced a mandatory five pence (US$0.06/€0.06) charge to customers for each single-use plastic bag taken from large stores. Combining a longitudinal survey (n = 1,230), supermarket observations (n = 3,764), and a longitudinal interview study (n = 43), we investigated people's behavioral and attitudinal responses to the charge. We show that all age, gender, and income groups in England substantially reduced their plastic bag usage within 1 month after the charge was introduced, with interviewees highlighting the ease of bringing their own bags. Support for the bag charge also increased among all key demographic groups. Increased support for the plastic bag charge in turn predicted greater support for other charges to reduce plastic waste, suggesting a ""policy spillover"" effect. Results indicate a broad and positive effect of the bag charge, which appears to have catalyzed wider waste awareness among the British public.

The narration of the novel occurs in Harlem (New York) in the 1920-s, however, because most characters’ identities originate in the mid-19th-century American South, time and space frames extend. Focusing on the city space in the novel Jazz we regard the city as a social and cultural phenomenon of America, an independent live character that enters into a dialogue with the novel’s protagonists and, at the same time, contributes to their alienation within its frames. Harlem of 1920s functions not only as sociohistorical background but also as a unique narrator that relates the urban experience of African-Americans. We deduce that the chronotope exhibited in the novel in question combines several places and embodies narration about protagonists’ roots, their original habitat and a new conflicting environment that both attracts and repels them. The intrinsic ties of time and space in the literary work discussed in the article are presented on the level of the city, which represents alien and fragmentized reality. Thus we are convinced that the alien city chronotope in the novel is shaped by the opposition of ethnic and cultural identities of characters within their changing world. The characters’ illusions and aspirations are guided by the dubious and forceful voice of the city and none of the protagonists is able to escape the traumatic labyrinth of time and space tracing their memory. © 2019 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Relying on the literary and metaphorical intuitions of Bataille as a writer, Foucault transfers Bataille’s concept of transgression from a social context to a philosophical one and radicalizes the idea. Bataille does not regard transgression as an anthropological constant, but as a historical phenomenon characterizing the modern secular era. Foucault does not define transgression in terms of a legitimate violation of prohibitions, but as the passage of human beings beyond their ontological limits, primarily in the experience of sexuality. Foucault makes the opposition pointed out by Bataille between transgression and dialectics a more profound one by interpreting transgression not as a dialectical restoration of the world’s integrity through contradictions, but as a permanent experience of the subject’s self-transcendence. Like Bataille, Foucault postulates the necessity of a special language to express such an experience in a non-discursive, non-dialectic, and ultimately even a non-conceptual way that adopts a discontinuous and “aphoristic” form. On the last point, he disagrees with Bataille’s pursuit of a mimetic and continuous “communication” reconstituted in literary texts rather than a semiotic discreteness of messages. © 2019, Gaidar Institute Press.

The author resorts to the umbrella term “post-postmodernism” to indicate the more complex theories that focus mainly on the analysis of the latest forms of capitalism rather than the concepts that offer themselves as direct alternatives to postmodernism even though they ignore the link between postmodernism and capitalism. The author takes up the idea, first argued for by the American Marxist philosopher Fredric Jameson, that postmodernism is the cultural logic of late capitalism and then uses Jameson’s approach in an attempt to retrace the continuity of new concepts of capitalism. The discussion begins with the theory of capitalist realism developed by leftist British thinker Mark Fisher. Fisher recognizes Jameson’s merits but takes exception to the term “postmodernism,” although the entire philosophical apparatus that Fisher uses is borrowed from Jameson’s work. The article then bridges the gap between capitalist realism and the latest left-wing theories such as accelerationism and post-capitalism. After tracing the close connection between the work of Mark Fisher and Nick Land, who worked together in the 1990’s at the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (CCRU) and the ideas of Nick Srnicek, the author asks why Srnicek and his colleagues are put off by Fredric Jameson’s postmodern theory. The answer is that postmodernism does not permit contemporary leftists to speculate about the future. However, as the author points out, Jameson’s ideas about postmodernism at the “genetic level” are implicit in Srnicek’s concept of post-capitalism, which makes Srnicek’s theory “post-postmodernist,” although as a negative variation (in contrast to Mark Fisher’s positive one). © 2019, Gaidar Institute Press.

Material and methods Active elbow flexion was restored in 30 patients with arthrogryposis (44 upper limbs) using unipolar LD transfer performed between 2011 and 2018 at the Turner Scientific and Research Institute for Children's Orthopaedics. The patients' age at the time of surgery ranged from 1 year to 10 years with the mean age of 3.98 ± 2.35 years. Clinical and neurological assessment was performed for the patients. Statistical data analysis was produced. Results The patients were subdivided into three groups with regard to the level of segmental injury to the spinal cord including C6-C7 (n = 8, 29.6 %, 13 limbs), C5-C7 (n = 17, 54.5 %, 24 limbs) and C6 (n = 5, 15.9 %, 7 limbs) levels. The patients were followed from 1 year to 7 years (3.2 ± 1.9). Postoperative passive and active elbow flexion was 100° ± 7.0° (min 80°, max 110°) and 90.5° ± 14.7° (min 40°, max 110°), respectively. Extension deficit of the elbow increased by 12.8° ± 4.8° (min 10°, max 20°) in 18 (51%) cases but made no impact on activities of daily living. The results of 20 patients (55.6 %) were rated good, 12 (33.3 %) were satisfied and 4 (11.1 %) had poor results. No correlation could be found between postoperative active flexion, extension deficit of the elbow and the level of segmental injury to the spinal cord in patients with involved levels of C6-C7 and C5-C7. Conclusions The LD can be regarded as the choice flap for restoration of active elbow flexion in patients with arthrogryposis and segmental involvement at C6, C6-C7, C5-C7 levels with baseline donor muscle strength grading 4 and over and passive elbow flexion of at least 90°. © Agranovich O.E., Kochenova E.A., Oreshkov A.B., Trofimova S.I., Petrova E.V., Gabbasova E.L., Blagoveshchenskii E.D., 2019.","Arthrogryposis; Elbow joint; Graft; Latissimus dorsi",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064203870

Most of the euthanasia attitude studies have been focused on groups directly involved in end-of-life issues, such as physicians and patients. This article investigates the typical views of common Russians in regard to euthanasia and related practices, and looks for their determinants. A survey of 1201 respondents in 2014 was conducted using a probabilistic sample representing the population of Russia. Measurement of euthanasia justifiability included descriptions of patients’ conditions and types of life termination procedures. Analysis of the results showed that basic values were important predictors of euthanasia justifiability. However, a model derived from international and western research failed to confirm this. Our hypothesis regarding the relations between values of autonomy and justification of euthanasia found only weak support, while benevolence values demonstrated a strong negative effect. Proximity to death showed a negative effect: the fact of caring for sick close ones, as well as one’s own ill-health, were related to a lower justification of euthanasia. Religiosity demonstrated only marginally significant coefficients. Contrary to our hypothesis, interactions between death proximity indicators and trust in physicians and people in general were insignificant. Another unexpected result was a negative link between confidence in the healthcare system and euthanasia justifiability. We attribute these findings to a “priestly” model of care prevalent among Russians; the characteristic structuring of values among Russians, in which care for others contradicts personal autonomy; as well as endorsement of avoidance over approach motivations. In conclusion we list the limitations of the study and point out the weak explanatory power of the models presented. © 2019, Federal Center of Theoretical and Applied Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The current situation in Russia in this area can be described as “negative stabilization”, because, although the decrease in the population’s incomes has stopped, they have stabilized at a lower level than prior to the crisis of 2014–2016. Groups which differ in the dynamics of their material situation starting from 2014 also differ in the specifics of their composition and positions in the system of monetary and especially non-monetary inequalities. The higher an individual’s place in the social hierarchy of life chances, the higher the likelihood of him being in an upward mobility group and the lower the chances of winding up in a group with downward mobility, and vice versa. For the evolution prospects of Russian society’s stratification model this means an increasing polarization of the mass strata of the population. However, so far these processes proceed at a moderate pace and affect the “top” rather than the “bottom” of these strata. The most significant factors determining Russians’ assessments of the dynamics of their material situation are their health, type of locus-control and planning horizon — personal characteristics that affect the ability of developing and implementing effective adaptation strategies. The high importance of personal factors for the dynamics of one’s material situation indicates the crisis nature of modern Russian society, since for crisis societies personal qualities of an individual are more important for the vector of his mobility than structural factors or human and social capital. © 2019, Federal Center of Theoretical and Applied Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The implications for employment and work in highly innovative industries are important topics for analysis, not least because we are in a period where dramatic claims are being made as to the implications of new technologies for professional occupations. Thus, this paper aims to address major debates and conclusions concerning innovation patterns in KIBS and the evolving structures of professional and other work in these industries. Design/methodology/approach: This essay combines literature review with presentation and discussion of statistics that throw light on the patterns of innovation that characterise KIBS. The authors also consider data that concern trends in the organisation of work in these industries; while the focus is mainly on KIBS firms, they also pay some attention to KIBS-like work in other sectors. Even though KIBS are distinctive industries in modern economies, these analyses can be related to more general studies of, and forecasts about, changes in work organisation. Findings: The authors show that innovation patterns and employment structures vary substantially across different types of KIBS, with the distinction between technological, professional and creative KIBS proving to be useful for capturing these differences. The authors are also able to demonstrate important long- and medium-term trends in the structure and activities of the KIBS industries. In particular, data clearly demonstrate the increasing share of professional as against associate and clerical workers in most KIBS. Evidence also suggests that polarisation trends across the economy are mirrored, and in some cases amplified, in KIBS. The future prospects for employment in KIBS, and for professional work in particular, are seen to involve multiple factors, which together may bring about substantial change. Research limitations/implications: The study involves literature review and industry-level statistical analysis. Future work would benefit from firm-level analysis and validation and explication of results via consultation with practitioners and users of KIBS. Some puzzling variations across countries and sectors will need to be explored with national and sectoral experts. Practical implications: Research into KIBS activities, and their future, should make more use of the extensive statistics on employment and other structural features of the industries that have become available in recent years. KIBS firms and practitioners will need to take account of the forces for change that are liable to restructure their activities. Originality/value: The literature on KIBS has been concentrated on a rather narrow range of issues, while analysis of the current contributions and future development of the industries requires attention to a wider range of topics. This paper suggests how these topics may be investigated and their implications explored and presents results of enquiries along these lines. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employment; Innovation; Knowledge economy; Knowledge intensive business services; Professions",,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063357229

The socio-cultural environment in the study is represented by the respondents’ perceptions about the predominance of a certain type of society at three levels: Russia as a whole, the region, the enterprise (educational institution). The social competitiveness of young people has only scarcely been studied by sociologists. In the article, this phenomenon is seen as the ability of social actors to achieve their goals in a society in the conditions of competition with other people. The empirical basis of this research is a representative survey, conducted in 2016 in the Krasnoyarsk Territory using formalized interviews among 1000 respondents. The article shows that the most competitive youth are those who perceive their socio-cultural macro environment (Russian society) as either pre-industrial, feudal or industrial, capitalistic one. It is established that there are two opposing in their meaning forms of the moral and value environment of the young people in the region, each of which ensures the high social competitiveness of a certain part of the youth. In particular, the socio-cultural environment of the competitiveness of young people corresponds to the contemporary state of Russian society. On the contrary, many adult actors continue to live in the socio-cultural context of the past era. It is concluded that the socio-cultural environment of the activity is specific for various social actors, and the identification of mechanisms of determination of social success is a promising area for further research. © Siberian Federal University.

The purpose of the research is to establish whether more intense competition is good or bad for innovation, and to learn how the response to competition varies between technology leaders, followers and laggards. The study uses the 2014 survey data, which includes 1920 manufacturing firms from 19 sectors and size groups between 10 and 10,000 employees. The finding is that commitment to product innovation increases with competition at a modest level of competitive pressure, especially if foreign entry and import are considered. However, this result is mostly driven by technologically weak plants, which innovate less than leaders and followers at a low level of competition, but are encouraged to innovate more by a modest increase of competitive pressure, when theoretically predicted optimal behavior would be to refrain from innovation. When competition is strong, plants in all technology groups give up the innovation race. Competition is less influential in explaining process (as opposed to product) innovation, and the findings demonstrate a clear inverted U-shaped link: laggards and leaders are more likely to upgrade process technologies when weak competition increases slightly, and are less likely to do so when strong competition becomes stronger. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Competitive pressure; Distance to the technology frontier; Manufacturing industry; Product and process innovation","Engineering education; Manufacture; Competitive pressure; Distance to the technology frontier; Manufacturing firms; Manufacturing industries; Process Innovation; Process Technologies; Product innovation; Various technologies; Competition","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063100895

In such VRP problems vehicles can have different capacities, fixed and travel costs, and site-dependency constraints limit for every customer a set of vehicles, which can serve it. The Vehicle Assignment Problem (VAP) arises in heuristic and exact algorithms, when vehicles are assigned to all customers or one customer is added to the current vehicle route. The VAP objective is to minimize the total assignment cost while the cost of assigning a vehicle to a customer is computed in some heuristic way. Without split deliveries, when a delivery to a customer cannot be split between two vehicles, the VAP problem is modeled in literature as the Generalized Assignment Problem. We demonstrate that allowing split deliveries reduces the VAP to the Hitchcock Transportation Problem, which can be efficiently solved with Transportation Simplex Methods. We also consider a special case, which is not rare in practice, when all customers are partitioned into classes, where customers have the same set of vehicles able to serve them, and the vehicle sets for these classes form a sequence of nested sets. We show that in this case if the cost per demand unit of assigning a vehicle to a customer depends only on the vehicle, then the VAP problem can be solved by a linear algorithm. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Site-dependent; Split deliveries; Vehicle assignment",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062786882

Focusing on his 1810–11 texts, the Stuttgart Seminars and the beginning of the Ages of the World, this paper traces the logic of bliss, in its connection with other key concepts such as indifference, the world or the system, at a crucial point in Schelling’s thinking. Bliss is shown, at once, to mark the zero point of the developmental narrative that Schelling constructs here (from God before creation, via the natural, historical, and spiritual world, to the fully actualized, ‘true pantheism’) and to interrupt it at every step. As a result, bliss emerges here in its real utopian force but also its all-too-real ambivalence, indifference, and even violence, despite Schelling’s best efforts to theorize it as ‘love’; and Schelling himself emerges, in these texts, as one of modernity’s foremost thinkers not just of nature or freedom, but also of bliss in its modern afterlives. At stake in Schelling’s conception of bliss, I argue, is the very relationship between history and eternity, the not-yet and the already-here, the present, and the eschatological—as well as between Spinozian immanence and the Christian temporality of salvation, so important for modernity (with what is often called its process of ‘secularization’)—not to mention the complex entanglement of indifference, violence, and love or the ideas of totality, nonproductivity, and nonrelation that Schellingian bliss involves. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Bliss; Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling; German idealism; Indifference; Pantheism; Spinozism",,"English",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059848349

Then the paper turns to the contribution of the Nobel laureates, who were the first ones to develop the theory of endogenous growth. In the case of the Romer model, technological progress is the result of intentional actions of firms, which introduce new products and thereby raise the overall productivity. In case of the Nordhaus model, production causes environmental damage, which then stifles further growth. In both cases production causes externalities, which have either positive or negative effect on growth. Then, the article considers further developments in the theory of economic growth, such as the Schumpeterian theory, unified growth theory, and institutional theory.

Authors propose the cascade scheme for ANN training phase where the network is fed with the pair-wise delays of received stationary or cyclostationary signals and the output of the network goes to the input of the target function being maximized together with the same data. The designed ANN topology has the modified output layer consisting of the custom neuron that implements argument function of a complex number rather than linear or sigmoid-like ones used in the conventional multilayer perceptron topologies. The simulation carried out for the ring array antenna shows that a single estimation obtained via ANN MLE takes 12 times less computational time comparing to the MLE implemented via the numerical optimization technique. The degradation of accuracy measured as the increase of mean-squared error does not exceed 10% of the potential value for the particular signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and that difference has no tendency to decrease for higher SNR.

The purpose of this paper is to examine factors in the Russian national context with weak non-profit sector with an ambiguous governmental policy toward the sector. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on survey data (n=850 NPOs, 2015, Russia). The paper analyses the likelihood of a non-profit to introduce SIs due to external framework and organizational factors. Regression analysis was applied in the study. The study is based on a new sampling approach and examines non-profits as producers of SIs, but not cases of SIs per se. Findings: The results demonstrate that the capacity of an NPO to develop SIs is explained by the following enabling factors: cross-boundary collaborative relations, volunteer involvement and diversity of the revenue structure. Composition of innovative sub-sector, opportunities and chances of getting into this group are explicitly determined and regulated by the current governmental policy toward the sector. That is that large and established non-profits are more likely to be innovative in Russia, unlike expected grass-roots. Originality/value: The paper applies a theoretical framework to analyze the SI concept in a non-western context with weak civil society and an influential government. From this perspective, the results present empirical quantitative verification of the determinants of SI capacity of NPOs. The paper is among the first to apply a reverse sampling principle and examine SIs via NPOs as producers.

In vocational schools, such industries include medicine, oil and gas production and chemical processing, transport, mining and metallurgy, electrical engineering and telecommunications, pedagogy, tertiary sector, architecture and construction. As for higher education, CE programs are pursued most actively by medical, multidisciplinary, pedagogical, law and economics, and polytechnic universities. A relationship has been established between CE enrollment and general student population. Implementation of CE programs contributes to financial sustainability of vocational institutions. Successful strategies may ensure from 25 to 40 percent of the total budget in educational institutions that specialize in oil and gas production and chemical processing, medicine, electrical and power engineering, ICT, law and economics. Efficient strategies include narrow specialization and collaboration with strategic enterprises, while online marketing tools play a relatively small part. Continuing education was found to contribute little to financial sustainability of large national universities despite higher CE enrollments, barely accounting for five percent of their total budget. At the same time, a number of small institutions of higher education (regional branch campuses and private universities) can generate over half of their income from CE programs, university status playing a guiding role in student attraction. Analysis of university strategies shows that low interest in implementing CE programs for the good of regional industries is related to the absence of CE-based indicators in annual monitoring reports and the lack of established policies for integrating CE programs into higher education. © 2019, National Research University Higher School of Economics.","Adult education and learning; Continuing education; Successful strategies in education; University; Vocational school",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065535667

The authors suppose that negative investment in health capital, in particular, smoking, alcohol consumption and lack of physical exercise, are the root causes of this phenomenon. The article tests the hypothesis that the most important reason for negative investments in health capital is the mass unwillingness of people to calculate the long-term consequences of their decisions. This reluctance can be described by the concept of investor myopia. This term means exclusion from consideration of future results, starting from a certain threshold point in time. Investor myopia can be considered as the most important consequence of disbelief in the future, which, in turn, can be generated by pessimism, lack of confidence, or ingrained psychology of the ""provisional ruler"". Thus, people who do not believe in the future are more prone to negative investments in health capital. Econometric analysis is based on the authors' own data obtained from surveys in 2016 and 2017.

В статье проверяется гипотеза о том, что важнейшей причиной негативных инвестиций в капитал здоровья является массовое нежелание людей просчитывать долгосрочные послед- ствия принимаемых ими решений. Такое нежелание можно описать поняти- ем инвестиционной близорукости. Под этим термином понимается исклю- чение из рассмотрения будущих результатов, начиная с некоего порогового момента времени. Инвестиционная близорукость может рассматриваться как важнейшее следствие неверия в будущее, которое, в свою очередь, может порождаться пессимизмом, неуверенностью или укоренившейся психологией временщика.

The authors show how the success of the Arab revolutions influenced the rise of protest activity in Eastern Europe in 2011. The similarities of the protests in Eastern Europe with the protests of the Arab Spring period are demonstrated. We also analyze ways of borrowing patterns of destabilization. The wave of protest activity after 2011 is compared with the previous wave of protest activity initiated by the global financial-economic crises of 2008-2009. In addition to the external factor of the Arab Spring, the article examines the internal factors of the protest activity of the second wave of the economic crisis associated with the economic crises in Portugal, Italy, Spain, and Greece. The authors define the most typical forms of destabilization for Eastern Europe: anti-government demonstrations, riots, terrorist actions, and guerrilla warfare. The contribution of the Ukrainian Revolution in 2014 to the dynamics of the most violent forms of protest in Eastern Europe is also analyzed. In explaining the special case of Ukraine which breaks with the general trend of Eastern Europe, the authors show that Ukraine experienced a transition from less-violent forms of destabilization (anti-government demonstrations and riots) to more violent ones (guerrilla warfare and terrorist attacks) in 2013-2014. The reasons for the growth of terrorist activity and guerrilla warfare as well as the role of the war in Donbass are discussed.

An effective approach to solving this problem is organizing remote access to experimental equipment based on the concept of multi-tenancy. Purpose: Developing a method to organize a high-tech digital educational environment, providing laboratory research in a remote multi-user mode for the training of engineers with contextual learning technology. Methods: Creating a unified structure for a digital educational environment segment, based on multi-user distributed measuring-control systems with a unified structure and special methods of adapting such systems to various conditions of their operation. Results: A unified structure for a digital educational environment segment has been developed and tested. Its main elements are a web laboratory providing regulated access of trainees to the laboratory studies, and multi-user distributed measuring-control systems implementing these studies by providing the trainees with parallel access to their shared resources: Automated laboratory layouts/ stands/installations. The created software complex for the collection and processing of statistical information about the functioning of multi-user distributed measuring-control systems as mass service systems underlies the proposed method of their adaptation to various operating conditions. The proposed segment of digital educational environment allows you to implement a number of contextual training directions, including: Application in experimental research of modern computer measuring technologies; studying the characteristics of a digital twin of a laboratory layout/installation using standard techniques; identification and verification of mathematical models of objects, devices, processes and phenomena under study, or samples of multi-user systems in the form of appropriate mass service systems; approbation of various shared resource dispatch algorithms. Practical relevance: The proposed structure of an educational environment segment provides training of engineers using innovative hardware and software solutions; operation of experimental equipment on the basis of multi-tenancy concept, reducing the cost of equipping a trainee workplace in dozens of times; system-level application of contextual learning technology. © 2019 Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation.

On the one hand, companies’ reports represent conservative policies and sustainable growth in the coming years. On the other hand, companies’ financial performance suggests another situation because of the insufficient level of financial indices that reflect the inconsistency of existing sustainable growth approaches. This situation indicates the relevance of the research concerning Russian gas companies’ financial sustainable growth in the conditions of the global economy, “economic sanctions” and investment policy implementation. The primary purpose of the research is to analyse Russian gas companies’ financial growth strategy employing Geniberg Z — matrix as well as enhanced financial sustainability indicators system indices by identifying which indicators have a greater influence on sustainable growth rate. We found that return on fixed assets ratio, net profit growth ratio, debt equity ratio influence on Russian gas companies’ sustainable growth rate and recommended for the system of financial sustainability indicators (FSIS) usage. We associate the concept of Russian gas companies’ financial sustainable growth with environmental protection, energy savings, and social factors. Thus, we added to the financial model non-financial factors. As a result of the analysis, we have obtained the dependence of Sustainable Growth Rate to Environmental Ratings as well as Return on social responsibility costs. We recommend paying more attention to the energy, social, environmental, and economic determinants that could contribute to sustainable growth.

In this note we avoid this difficulty presenting the points of the moduli space of special Bohr–Sommerfeld Lagrangian cycles by exact compact Lagrangian submanifolds on the complements X\D α modulo Hamiltonian isotopies, where D α is the zero divisor of holomorphic section α. This correspondence is fair if the Eliashberg conjecture is true, stating that every smooth orientable exact Lagrangian submanifold is regular.

Data for analysis contains trademark owners' production capacities and investments in the territory of Russia for the period from 1991 to 2016. We present an estimate of the volume of trademark owners' localization on the territory of Russia by sector, territory and time of capital investments. The paper shows that investments in production by trademark owners are not correlated to the ban on parallel import and are more likely explained by other factors than the introduction of national exhaustion of intellectual property rights. Also, upon comparison of data on the volumes of localization of trademark owners and import statistics for protected trademarks, it was revealed that a significant proportion of trademark owners, which gain a benefit from the ban of parallel import, did not invest in production in Russia.

Целью работы является оценка влияния выбора действующего режима исчерпания прав на решение о локализации производства в России, а также на структуру производственных активов ино- странных правообладателей в России. В качестве основы анализа выступают данные о про- изводственных мощностях и вложенных за период с 1991 по 2016 годы инвестициях ино- странных правообладателей на территории России. По итогам анализа представлена оценка объема локализации производства правообладателей на территории России в отраслевом и территориальном разрезах, а также в разрезе времени осуществления капитальных вло- жений. Продемонстрировано, что инвестиции в производство со стороны правообладателей часто не связаны с запретом параллельного импорта и в большей мере объясняются не вве- дением национального режима исчерпания прав собственности на товарные знаки, а иными факторами. По результатам сравнения данных об объемах локализации и статистики импорта под «защищенными» товарными знаками выявлено, что значительная часть правообладате- лей, получающих выгоды от запрета параллельного импорта, не осуществляла инвестиции в производство на территории России. Полученные результаты могут быть полезны для го- сударственной политики в сфере защиты прав интеллектуальной собственности, в частности при принятии решения о легализации параллельного импорта и выработке мер по переходу на международный режим исчерпания прав собственности на товарные знаки.","Exhaustion doctrine; Investment; Parallel imports; Доктрина исчерпания прав собственности; Инвестиции; Параллельный импорт",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063566874

Strong ionization during the fluid–fluid phase transition in warm dense hydrogen makes this transition close to the prediction of the PPT.

Working on the assumption that distorted texts might disobey Zipf’s Law, we explored correlations among frequencies and text entirety compared with text distortions. Results reveal the crucial role of text length for maintaining Zipfian distribution: randomly chosen sets of words and fragmentary texts of optimal size still obey Zipf’s Law.

Design/methodology/approach: Using horizon scanning, scenario analysis and expert opinion, nine capabilities are identified as core areas to be developed to support the country’s future growth of product-service systems. Findings: The results of a Delphi survey involving 30 industry and academic thought leaders recommend priorities of these capabilities. This paper concludes with a discussion of the study implications for theory, research and practice in the domain of servitisation and product-service systems. Research limitations/implications: The foresight study presented here on the future of servitisation in Singapore demonstrates one of the first fully fledged applications of foresight in constructing a coherent vision of future product-service system markets. In this study, the authors applied systemic foresight methodology (SFM) comprising the first six phases: initiation (scoping), intelligence (scanning), imagination (scenarios), integration (priorities), interpretation (strategies) and implementation (action).For future research, an ideal step would be to proceed with the final phase of the SFM, impact, to develop indicators for servitisation and to monitor and evaluate the transition process. Practical implications: Manufacturing and services are no longer distinct concepts with a clear divide. Manufacturing firms not only become more service dependent but also produce and provide services for their consumers. This transformation towards servitisation implies fundamental re-organisation of the production and management practices. Furthermore, through new business models, new and loyal customers will be gained, which will in turn bring additional income, while making the companies less prone to economic and business fluctuations. Social implications: The results of this study have practical implications for policymakers of public and private sectors that are interested in playing a key role in future product-service system innovation. These have implications for developing the human and intellectual capital that are required for supporting the future innovation. Institutes of higher learning and vocational institutes should also consider incorporating new curricula and modules to build the capabilities for knowledge creation and transfer. Originality/value: The findings of the present study on strategic growth areas and relevant critical capabilities provide new directions for research in the field of servitisation.

Two alternative panel specifications are considered, labelled “spatial interaction specification with exogenous spatial lags” and “gravity-type specification with network effects”. While both specifications are designed to capture the impacts of neighbouring regions in migration dynamics, they differ with respect to the implementation of fixed effects. It is argued that neighbourhood impacts manifest themselves either as spillover effects, which amplify a variable's impact, or competition effects, which attenuate them. The results show that variables indeed differ from each other in these respects, demonstrating how migration patterns are subject to events beyond the directly involved regions, and that these are furthermore influenced by the distances between regions. In addition, the results provide further evidence that migration determinants differ for Eastern and Western Russia. © 2019","Gravity model; Internal migration; Russia; Spatial econometrics; Spatial interaction models",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061637411

Convergence of ageing leads to economic convergence only when the share of the working age population in rich regions exceeds that in poor regions and the former regions experience a substantial decline in the share of the working age population, or the latter regions experience an increase.

Although the issues related to the motivation of entrepreneurs have been widely studied, there are a few studies focusing on the differences in women’s entrepreneurial motivation in countries with different levels of market economy development. Furthermore, existing studies on female founders mainly adapt the concepts that have often been developed in male-dominated paradigm. The purpose of this paper is to explore in depth motivations of female entrepreneurs in different contexts and discover the dissimilarities in women’s entrepreneurial motivations in countries with different levels of economic development. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative research approach is applied in this study to explore the social-driven and profit-driven motives of female entrepreneurs. The authors have employed purposeful sampling to select cases. The authors investigated the motivations of 45 female entrepreneurs in Norway (12), Russia (21) and Ukraine (12). Semi-structured interviews were used to collect primary data. The authors have also triangulated the data collected from interviews with the data available on the internet, company reports and newspaper publications. Findings: The findings indicate that women often pursuit business opportunities to satisfy social needs, rather than focusing on traditional business outcomes such as growth or profit. However, different contexts – the emerging economies context of Russia and Ukraine and the developed one of Norway – seem to influence the motivation to establish new ventures differently. The study found a stronger desire to contribute to a society’s needs among female founders in Norway compared to their counterparts in Russia and Ukraine. This indicates that cultural and social context in developed countries, such as in Norway, probably provides more possibilities for female entrepreneurs for self-realisation elsewhere leaving more room for focusing on societal issues in business in comparison with emerging countries contexts. Originality/value: A novel conceptual contribution is the exploration of links between the social-driven and profit-driven motives of female entrepreneurs in emerging and developed economises. The study also adds to debates relating to context embeddedness of smaller firms. © 2019, Marina Solesvik, Tatiana Iakovleva and Anna Trifilova.","Norway; Russia; Ukraine",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061340271

A population balance approach is presented for computing the particle transport and capture by porous media. The occupied area of each attached particle is particle size-dependent. The main model assumption is the retention rate dependency of the overall vacancy concentration for all particle sizes. For the first time, we derive an exact averaging (upscaling) procedure resulting in a closed system of large-scale equations for average concentrations of suspended and retained particles and of occupied rock surface area. The resulting large-scale 3 × 3 system significantly differs from the traditional 2 × 2 deep bed filtration model. However, the traditional model becomes a particular case that corresponds to an equal occupied area for all particles. The averaging yields the appearance of two empirical suspension and site occupation functions, which govern the kinetics of particle retention and site occupation, respectively. One-dimensional flow problems for the averaged equations are essentially nonlinear. However, they allow for exact solutions. We derive novel exact solutions for three 1-D problems: continuous injection of particulate colloidal suspension, injection of colloidal suspension bank with particle-free chase drive, and fines migration induced by high-rate flows. The analytical model for continuous injection closely matches three series of laboratory tests on nanofluid transport. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

One of the challenges of such systems is efficient offloading of the data from access points (AP) to the network infrastructure. This task is of special importance for APs installed in remote areas with no transport network available. In this paper, we assess the packet level performance of mmWave technology for cost-efficient backhauling of remote 3GPP NR APs connectivity 'islands'. Using a queuing system with arrival processes of the same priority competing for transmission resources, we assess the aggregated and per-AP packet loss probability as a function environmental conditions, mmWave system specifics, and generated traffic volume. We show that the autocorrelation in aggregated traffic provides a significant impact on service characteristics of mmWave backhaul and needs to be compensated by increasing either emitted power or the number of antenna array elements. The effect of autocorrelation in the per-AP traffic and background traffic from other APs also negatively affects the per-AP packet loss probability. However, the effect is of different magnitude and heavily depends on the load fraction of per-AP traffic in the aggregated traffic stream. The developed model can be used to parameterize mmWave backhaul links as a function of the propagation environment, system design, and traffic conditions. © 2013 IEEE.","5G mobile communication; mathematical model; millimeter wave communication; Next generation networking; queueing analysis; wireless communication","Antenna arrays; Autocorrelation; Mathematical models; Mobile radio systems; Motor transportation; Next generation networks; Packet loss; Millimeter-wave communication; Mobile communications; Next generation networking; Queueing analysis; Wireless communications; Millimeter waves","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061089480

In particular, how is Sufism related to the concept of “traditional Islam” as a central official category that seeks to define a local Islam? In order to understand how the place of Sufism is negotiated in relation to the notion of a local Islam, we analyse both how Sufism is integrated into the concept of traditional Islam on a more official level and how Sufi murids view their place in the Islamic revival. We refer to the literature on Sufism and its critiques and to new interpretations of the Volga-Ural Muslim history to highlight how negative images of the phenomenon and previous theological disputes form the background against which the Sufi revival takes place. Drawing on the idea of Sufism’s “disappearance” from a historical narrative in Soviet times and on the importance of anti-Sufi critiques in fashioning this narrative, we aim to understand how a new narrative on Sufism emerges on an official level and how it connects or not with the way Sufi murids perceive their beliefs and practices. By analysing convergences and divergences in official perceptions of Sufism and the perceptions of Sufi murids, we examine how the question of Sufism sheds light on the paradoxes in the concept of traditional Islam. Hence, Sufism challenges the image of a unified theological heritage as a foundation for traditional Islam, as it brings to the fore the anti-Sufi critique of previous Jadids. While official views and the views of Sufi murids converge on a more theological definition of traditional Islam understood as the three dimensions of Islam (islam, iman and ihsan), Sufism also raises the question of religious authority. Indeed, the spiritual hierarchies represented by Sufi tariqas may not be easy to reconcile with an official Muslim representation. Finally, Sufi murids refer to the notion of a local sacred geography, but also emphasise the transnational and transregional connections established by Sufi tariqas, thus pointing to another understanding of locality. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Islam in Russia; Local Islam; Religious authority; Sufism; Traditional Islam; Volga-Ural region",,"English",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059889255

Given this divergence, we meta-analyze 127 studies in order to test whether different types of owners (if a firm's ownership lies mainly in the hands of managers, families or institutions) explain these mixed results. We also examine whether the institutional context (civil, common or emerging legal system) may moderate the relationship between ownership concentration and type of owner and board independence. We find that ownership concentration has a significant negative relation with board independence in common law countries, and when firms are under managerial or family control. In contrast, the relation is positive for firms in civil law countries or for firms owned by institutional investors. Thus, our paper reveals differences in the relation between ownership concentration and board of director independence contingent on type of owner and the institutional context in which the firm operates.

Individuals gained the Constitutional right to own land in 1993, but implementation was stalled. The pace of land privatization can be explained by arguably exogenous factors such as distance to Moscow, as well as climate and also regional political culture, proxied by concentration of votes in the 2004 presidential election. We show that this rate of land privatization in Russia's regions was significantly associated with output growth in 2010–2014, confirming the policy importance of this measure for developing economies.

Yet, the contribution of implicit interoceptive signals of bodily states to error-monitoring during ongoing performance has been overlooked.

In this study, by combining ERP, source localization and multivariate pattern classification analysis, we found that the error-minus-correct ERP waveform had an enhanced amplitude within 40–100 ms following errors in the systolic period of the cardiac cycle. This component could be decoded from single-trials, was dissociated from the preERN and PE, and stemmed from the inferior parietal cortex, which is a region implicated in cardiac autonomic regulation. In addition, the phase of the cardiac cycle influenced behavioral alterations resulting from errors, with a smaller post-error slowing and less perturbed velocity in keystrokes following pitch errors in the systole relative to the diastole phase of the cardiac cycle. Lastly, changes in the heart rate anticipated the upcoming occurrence of errors. This study provides the first evidence of preconscious visceral information modulating neural and behavioral responses related to early error monitoring during skilled performance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065038458

This result extends some known global controllability theorems though being substantially nonconstructive. We give a fish a different recipe of how to survive in a turbulent ocean, and show its relationship to structural stability of dynamical systems by providing a constructive way to change slightly the velocity field to produce conservative (in the sense of not having wandering sets of positive measure)dynamics. In particular, this leads to the extension of C. Pugh's closing lemma to incompressible vector fields over unbounded domains.

One of the most important ways to predict a new disaster is to determine the rate of ice accumulation of the new glacier and to monitor the glacier volume regularly, since its trigger mechanisms have not yet been fully studied. Recent changes of the Kolka Glacier were investigated by means of ground stereoscopic photography. The field works were carried out in 2014, 2016 and 2017. Shooting was made manually with a digital camera Canon 5D Mark II (without using a tripod) at arbitrary points, the distance between which did not exceed 100 m. The reference points were placed on the elevated relief forms on the glacier surface and coordinated by a differential GNSS receiver in the ""fast static"" mode. Laboratory processing of the photos was performed using Agisoft Photoscan software in automatic mode, except for the procedure of identification of reference points on stereo images. The processing made possible to obtain digital models of the glacier surface in Geo-TIFF format, the vertical error of which amounted to 0.7 m, while the horizontal one - 2.3 m. In 2014-2017, the maximal increase in height of the surface (up to 30 m) was recorded in the low part of the glacier tongue that was the result of advancing of the Kolka front along the ice-free surface. Mean annual increase in the surface elevation was equal to 2.2 m/year. Lowering of the surface in some areas may be explained by the slowing-down of the glacier flow rate, which led to the appearance of thermokarst. The glacier volume increased by 7.4±0.7 million m 3 . As a result, the glacier tongue advanced by 50-70 m. Average over 2014-2017 increasing in the surface elevation (2.2 m/year) was slightly smaller than in 2004-2014 (3 m/year). Quick growth of the Kolka Gacier contrasts sharply with decreasing of volume of the representative Caucasus, Djankuat and Garabashi, over the same period. © 2019 Izdatel'stvo Nauka.

Our method can be summarised as follows: (i) cluster the data set; (ii) select the entities that have the most potential to be assigned to correct clusters; (iii) use the entities of the previous step to define the core clusters and map them to the labels using a confusion matrix; (iv) use the core clusters and our cluster membership criterion to correct the labels of the remaining entities. We perform numerous experiments to validate our method empirically using k-nearest neighbour classifiers as a benchmark. We experiment with both synthetic and real-world data sets with different proportions of mislabelled entities. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method produces promising results.

Our results suggest that students in STEM fields tend to have higher absolute achievement gains compared to students in humanities and pedagogical programs, and that in a few fields, such as civil engineering and history, the relative gains for students in highly selective programs in that field of study are significantly higher than if they had attended somewhat less selective programs. However, students attending lowest quintile selective programs in a field of study have consistently lower gains across a range of study fields than similar students attending programs just one quintile higher.

A computational method utilizing the tight-binding approximation to the Schrödinger equation is used to solve for the transmission probabilities as a function of the electron energy and external magnetic flux. The flux dependence is incorporated into the model using a standard procedure involving the Aharonov–Bohm effect. The positions of the transmission zeros and poles in the complex energy plane, and their possible interference with or even complete cancellation of each other, are shown to correlate with the amplitude and structure of the circular transmission resonances. Large-amplitude resonances of the circular transmission are found to occur when two poles of the transmission are separated along the imaginary axis. These resonances demonstrate a high degree of flux sensitivity at specific energy values and flux ranges. A small change in flux causes the orientation of the resonance poles in the complex energy plane to rotate parallel to the real energy axis, resulting in a concurrent decrease in the circular transmission amplitude. The flux-dependent interference between the transmission poles and zeros in the complex energy plane leads to a decrease of the circular transmission resonance amplitudes. The circular transmission and its corresponding current–voltage characteristic provide more information related to the external flux than can be obtained from the normal transmission alone. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Circular current; Complex energy plane; Magnetic flux; Quantum dot ring; Resonances","Electron energy levels; Magnetic flux; Nanocrystals; Resonance; Semiconductor quantum dots; Circular current; Circular transmission; Complex energy; Standard procedures; Tight-binding approximations; Transmission poles; Transmission probabilities; Voltage characteristics; Magnetic field effects","English",Article in Press,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059533706

This work proposes an algorithm that combines hierarchical approach for RL and the ability of neural networks to serve as universal function approximators. To perform the hierarchy of actions the options framework is used which main idea is to utilize macro-actions (the sequence of simpler actions). State of the environment is the input to a convolutional neural network that plays a role of Q-function estimating the utility of every possible action and skill in the given state. We learn each option separately using different neural networks and then combine result into one architecture with top-level approximator.

In contrast to the classical case of static flows, a flow over time in such a network specifies a flow rate entering an arc for each point in time. In this setting, the capacity of an arc limits the rate of flow into the arc at each point in time. Traditionally, flows over time are computed in time-expanded networks that contain one copy of the original network for each discrete time step. While this method makes available the whole algorithmic toolbox developed for static network flows, its drawback is the enormous size of the time-expanded network. In this paper, we extend the results about the minimum flow problem to network flows (with n nodes and m arcs) in which the time-varying lower bounds can involve both the source and the sink nodes (as in Fathabadi et al.) and also one additional node other than the source and the sink nodes. It is shown that this problem for the set { 0 , 1 , … , T} of time points can be solved by at most n minimum flow computations, by suitably extending the dynamic minimum flow algorithm and reoptimization techniques.

Two recent experimental studies have challenged this conclusion suggesting that Japanese complex NP (CNP) subjects are more opaque to subextraction than CNP objects (Jurka 2010; Jurka et al. 2011). Given the significance of this claim for the cross-linguistic landscape of subextraction phenomena, this study further explores the nature of subextraction phenomena in Japanese with three acceptability judgment experiments. We show that overt subextraction (scrambling) out of CNP subjects and objects results in similar acceptability ratings once the relative weight and order of constituents are properly controlled for. Recent experimental work which suggested that Japanese has a subject-object asymmetry to subextraction predicted that wh-in-situ adjuncts should lead to greater degradation for subextraction out of subjects as compared to subextraction out of objects. To test this prediction, we also present novel experimental data on wh-in-situ phrases inside subjects and objects in Japanese. Our results show that the argument/adjunct status of wh-in-situ phrases does not interact with the subject/object status of the CNPs, further invalidating the recent claims. Together these findings support the traditional view that Japanese has no subject-object asymmetry in subextraction, whether overt or covert. Having restored the status of Japanese as a language with no subject-object asymmetry in subextraction, we discuss possible reasons that could account for the absence of such an asymmetry. We suggest that the lack of asymmetry is due to Japanese subjects’ inability to satisfy the EPP on T/C; we further contend that cross-linguistic variation in subject transparency follows from whether or not the feature D comes from subjects. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","CED effects; Japanese; Scrambling; Sentence acceptability judgment; Subextractions; Subject island effects; wh-in-situ",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064673982

The authors find a striking similarity between the measures proposed by modern Russian economic liberals - as well as their consequences - and the actions taken by the Russian authorities during much earlier periods. They explain these similarities with the fact that ""Western"" terms can mean something very different in the context of a non-Western culture, phenomena and institutions with the same names in different types of societies can differ fundamentally and perform different functions. Furthermore, ""Westernization"" can be a purely superficial process intended more for show than for substance. By applying the methodology of substantivism which stresses the fundamental differences between economies based on gifts (reciprocity), redistribution, and exchange (market), they argue that Russia's economy differs significantly from that of the countries of Western Europe and, in the typological sense, is closer to such European countries as Bulgaria, Albania, Romania, and Serbia.

In addition, economy and statistics play a key role in both choosing and testing hypotheses. Hence we may show also the connection between the methodology of the economy of research and statistical frequentism, both originating from pragmaticism. The connection is drawn by the regulative principles of synechism, tychism and uberty. These principles are values that have both epistemic and non-epistemic dimension. They concern both the decisions to test a hypothesis as well as inductive risk. The validity of this result stems from the values cost–benefit analysis imposes on scientific inquiry. Values associated with the economy of research are important not only in the pre-test phases of generating hypotheses but also when hypotheses are effectively tested. Peirce took these economic considerations to leave room for an interpretation of probability which is not only a frequentist and propensity-theoretic but also a conceptualist one referring to degrees of belief.

We take a step further than the established literature focusing on technology transfer to examine factors that also affect the chances of the successful commercialization of the transferred technologies through an empirical analysis of 669 technology transfer cases in Korea. The study shows that the intensity of market competition is a key factor in moderating the effects of partnership and absorptive capacity on the successful commercialization of transferred technologies. While collaboration with U&PRIs exerts a positive effect on commercialization success, this effect is weakened by the intensity of market competition. The intensity of market competition boosts the importance of company absorptive capacity for the commercialization success of the transferred technology.

Here we propose tissue-cooperative, homeostatic model of NAFLD. During early stages of NAFLD the intrahepatic production of miR-122 falls, while the secretion of miRNA-containing exosomes by adipose increases. Bloodstream carries exosome to the liver, where their miRNA cargo is released to regulate their intrahepatic targets. When the deterioration of adipose catches up with the failing hepatic parenchyma, the external supply of liver-supporting miRNAs gradually tapers off, leading to the fibrotic decompensation of the liver and an increase in hepatic carcinogenesis. This model may explain paradoxical observations of the disease-associated decrease in intrahepatic production of certain miRNAs with an increase in their levels in serum. Infusions of miR-122 and, possibly, some other miRNAs may be efficient for preventing NAFLD-associated hepatocellular carcinoma. The best candidates for exosome-wrapped miRNA producer are adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), known for their capacity to shed large amounts of exosomes into the media. Notably, MSC-derived exosomes with no specific loading are already tested in patients with liver fibrosis. Carrier exosomes may be co-manufactured along with their cargo.

Oxygen surface exchange kinetics is considered in the framework of two-step models including two consecutive stages: dissociative adsorption of oxygen and incorporation of oxygen adatoms into the crystal lattice. The rates of oxygen heterogeneous exchange (r H ) as well as the rates of dissociative adsorption (r a ) and oxygen incorporation (r i ) have been calculated. The applicability of the two-step model is discussed based on the concept of a novel two-step mechanism with distributed rates of dissociative adsorption and incorporation of oxygen. It is shown that the two-step model can be applicable for the description of oxygen exchange kinetics in Pr 1.75 Sr 0.25 Ni 0.75 Co 0.25 O 4±δ only at temperatures below 750 °C. Above this temperature, only the statistical model with distributed rates can be used. At low temperatures (&lt;750 °C), the oxygen incorporation rate is found to be smaller than the rate of oxygen dissociative adsorption. Thus, under these experimental conditions the stage of oxygen incorporation is considered to be rate-determining. When increasing the temperature, the difference between r a and r i decreases and the stages become competing. The oxygen isotope exchange kinetic profiles obtained using the IE GPE method are found to be complicated and include a surface exchange stage as well as at least two diffusion relaxation processes. The reasons for the existence of these two processes are discussed. © 2019 the Owner Societies.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062300753

Methods: The results of mandatory medical examinations of 5006 workers engaged in the pyrometallurgic and electrolytic departments of nickel and copper have been analyzed. The disability adjusted life years lost, (DALY) due to diseases having a stable and statistically significant relationship with occupational hazards has been determined. Results: 53 % of the total number of employees are occupationally exposed to nickel and copper compounds, including 50.9 % those exposed to unacceptable nickel air concentrations, 9.2 % to copper air concentrations and 19.9 % to dust of mixed composition. At the same time, the relative risk of the occupational diseases turned out to be the most significant among workers employed in the nickel-electroplating department (NED) - 6.78, and the lowest was in workers employed in copper department. The prevalence rate of work-related diseases at NED had been declining by 27.8 % from 2006 to 2015, in the pyro-refining department - by 26.8 %, and among workers who have periodic exposure to these metals - by 24.1 %.

The content and composition of FAs in plants are commonly determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GS-MS) or gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) techniques. In the present work, we applied ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) technique to FA profiling of sunflower and rapeseed seeds and compared this method with the GC-FID technique. GC-FID detected 11 FAs in sunflower and 13 FAs in rapeseed, while UPLC-MS appeared to be more sensitive, detecting about 2.5 times higher numbers of FAs in both plants. In addition to even-chain FAs, UPLC-MS was able to detect odd-chain FAs. The longest FA detected using GC-FID was an FA with 24 carbon atoms, whereas UPLC-MS could reveal the presence of longer FAs with the tails of up to 28 carbon atoms.

In Phase 1, a review of existing instruments and focus group interviews were carried out to create a pool of possible labels for a modified severity classification. Participants aged 8–15 rated the severity of the identified labels in individual sorting and response scaling interviews. In Phase 2, preliminary 4L and 5L versions were constructed for further testing in cognitive interviews with healthy participants aged 8–15 years and children receiving treatment for a health condition. Results: In Phase 1, a total of 233 labels was generated, ranging from 37 (UK) to 79 labels (Germany). Out of these, 7 to 16 possible labels for each dimension in the different languages were rated in 255 sorting and response scaling interviews. Labels covered an appropriate range of severity on the health continuum in all countries. In Phase 2, the 5L version was generally preferred (by 68–88% of the participants per country) over the 4L version. Conclusions: This multinational study has provided a version of the EQ-5D-Y with 5 severity levels in each dimension. This extended version (EQ-5D-Y-5L) requires testing its psychometric properties and its performance compared to that of the original EQ-5D-Y-3L. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adolescent; Children; EQ-5D-Y; EQ-5D-Y-3L; EQ-5D-Y-5L; Health-related quality of life (HRQoL)","adolescent; article; child; controlled study; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; feasibility study; female; Germany; human; human experiment; interview; language; male; multicenter study; quality of life; school child; Spain; Sweden","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061302851

The main components of vegetable oil are triglycerides (TAGs) (about 97%). Ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS) profiling of TAGs in sunflower and rapeseed has been performed and the TAG profiles obtained for these species have been compared. It has been identified that 34 TAGs are shared by sunflower and rapeseed. It was demonstrated that TAGs 52:2, 52:5, 52:6, 54:3; 54:4, 54:7, 56:3, 56:4, and 56:5 had the highest variability levels between sunflower and rapeseed with the higher presence in rapeseed. TAGs 50:2, 52:3, 52:4, 54:5, and 54:6 also showed high variability, but were the most abundant in sunflower. Moreover, the differences in TAG composition between the winter-type and spring-type rapeseed have been revealed, which may be associated with freezing tolerance. It was shown that winter-type rapeseed seeds contain TAGs with a lower degree of saturation, while in spring-type rapeseed highly saturated lipids are the most abundant. These findings may give new insights into the cold resistance mechanisms in plants the understanding of which is especially important in terms of global climate changes. © 2018 by the authors.

Here we have demonstrated that one such transcript is translated into a 56-aminoacid- long peptide conserved in chordates, corroborating the work published while this manuscript was under review. The Mtln peptide could be detected in mitochondria of mouse cell lines and tissues. In line with its mitochondrial localization, lack of the Mtln decreases the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I. Unlike the integral components and assembly factors of NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, Mtln does not alter its enzymatic activity directly. Interaction of Mtln with NADH-dependent cytochrome b5 reductase stimulates complex I functioning most likely by providing a favorable lipid composition of the membrane. Study of Mtln illuminates the importance of small peptides, whose genes might frequently be misannotated as lncRNAs, for the control of vitally important cellular processes. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

The QPO frequency strongly evolved with the source flux during the NuSTAR observation. The source spectrum became softer with rising QPO frequency and simultaneous increasing of the power-law index and decreasing of the cut-off energy. In the power spectrum, a prominent harmonic is clearly seen together with the main QPO peak. The fluxes in the soft and the hard X-ray bands are coherent, however, the coherence drops for the energy bands separated by larger gaps. The phase lags are generally positive (hard) in the 0.1-3 Hz frequency range, and negative below 0.1 Hz. The accretion disc inner radius estimated with the relativistic reflection spectral model appears to be Rin &lt; 7.3Rg. In the framework of the relativistic precession model, in order to satisfy the constraints from the observed QPO frequency and the accretion disc truncation radius, a massive black hole with MBH ≈ 100M⊙ is required. © 2018 The Author(s).

We use a combination of computational modeling, NMR spectroscopy and cell experiments to analyze in detail the mechanism of how TM domains contribute to the activation of wild-type (WT) PDGFRA and its oncogenic V536E mutant. Using a computational framework, we scan all positions in PDGFRA TM helix for identification of potential functional mutations for the WT and the mutant and reveal the relationship between the receptor activity and TM dimerization via different interfaces. This strategy also allows us design a novel activating mutation in the WT (I537D) and a compensatory mutation in the V536E background eliminating its constitutive activity (S541G). We show both computationally and experimentally that single-point mutations in the TM region reshape the TM dimer ensemble and delineate the structural and dynamic determinants of spontaneous activation of PDGFRA via its TM domain. Our atomistic picture of the coupling between TM dimerization and PDGFRA activation corroborates the data obtained for other RTKs and provides a foundation for developing novel modulators of the pathological activity of PDGFRA. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Dimerization of transmembrane domains; Molecular dynamics; NMR; Oncogenic mutations; Receptor tyrosine kinases; Signal transduction","aspartic acid; dimer; glutamic acid; glycine; isoleucine; leucine; oligomer; platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor; protein kinase B; serine; STAT5 protein; valine; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; amino terminal sequence; animal cell; aortic endothelial cell; Article; atom; atomistic mechanism; carboxy terminal sequence; cell membrane; cell proliferation; cellular distribution; computer model; controlled study; dimerization; enzyme phosphorylation; mathematical model; molecular dynamics; mouse; mutagenesis; mutational analysis; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance; oligomerization; oncogene; pig; point mutation; priority journal; protein conformation; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein structure; signal transduction; transmembrane domain","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054319921

Here, it is demonstrate that there is another quantum-confinement mechanism overlooked in previous studies. In particular, it is found that the electron–electron attraction can be enhanced due to quantum-confinement modifications of electronic wave functions. The superconducting correlations are strengthened by such quantum mechanical effect, which creates a subtle interplay with surface–substrate phonon modifications. The combined effect depends on nanofilm thickness and can be controlled by nanoarchitechture. The calculations are in a reasonable agreement with experiments performed on high-quality aluminum films.

We focus on the ability of these quantum machines to provide an efficient transfer of information between distant parts of the processors by placing Alice and Bob at different qubits of the devices. We also examine the ability of quantum devices to serve as quantum memory and to store entangled states used in quantum communication. Another issue we address is an error mitigation. Although it is at odds with benchmarking, this problem is nevertheless of importance in a general context of quantum computation with noisy quantum devices.

These variations trace the propagation of illuminating fronts, presumably induced by past flaring activities of Sgr A. In this paper, we present results of a long NuSTAR observation of the Arches complex in 2016, taken a year after the previous XMM+NuSTAR observations which revealed a strong decline in the cloud emission. The 2016 NuSTAR observation shows that both the non-thermal continuum emission and the Fe K α 6.4 keV line flux are consistent with the level measured in 2015. No significant variation has been detected in both spectral shape and Fe K α equivalent width EW 6.4 keV, which may be interpreted as the intensity of the Arches non-thermal emission reaching its stationary level. At the same time, the measured 2016 non-thermal flux is not formally in disagreement with the declining trend observed in 2007-2015. Thus, we cannot assess whether the non-thermal emission has reached a stationary level in 2016, and new observations, separated by a longer time period, are needed to draw stringent conclusions. Detailed spectral analysis of three bright clumps of the Arches molecular cloud performed for the first time showed different EW 6.4 keV and absorption. This is a strong hint that the X-ray emission from the molecular cloud is a mix of two components with different origins. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.","ISM: clouds; X-rays: individual: Arches cluster",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063402056

Burden of Disease Study 2016 to describe patterns of suicide mortality globally, regionally, and for 195 countries and territories by age, sex, and Socio-demographic index, and to describe temporal trends between 1990 and 2016. Design Systematic analysis. Main outcome measures Crude and age standardised rates from suicide mortality and years of life lost were compared across regions and countries, and by age, sex, and Socio-demographic index (a composite measure of fertility, income, and education). Results The total number of deaths from suicide increased by 6.7% (95% uncertainty interval 0.4% to 15.6%) globally over the 27 year study period to 817 000 (762 000 to 884 000) deaths in 2016. However, the age standardised mortality rate for suicide decreased by 32.7% (27.2% to 36.6%) worldwide between 1990 and 2016, similar to the decline in the global age standardised mortality rate of 30.6%. Suicide was the leading cause of age standardised years of life lost in the Global Burden of Disease region of high income Asia Pacific and was among the top 10 leading causes in eastern Europe, central Europe, western Europe, central Asia, Australasia, southern Latin America, and high income North America. Rates for men were higher than for women across regions, countries, and age groups, except for the 15 to 19 age group. There was variation in the female to male ratio, with higher ratios at lower levels of Socio-demographic index. Women experienced greater decreases in mortality rates (49.0%, 95% uncertainty interval 42.6% to 54.6%) than men (23.8%, 15.6% to 32.7%). Conclusions Age standardised mortality rates for suicide have greatly reduced since 1990, but suicide remains an important contributor to mortality worldwide. Suicide mortality was variable across locations, between sexes, and between age groups. Suicide prevention strategies can be targeted towards vulnerable populations if they are informed by variations in mortality rates. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; Article; Asia; Australia and New Zealand; Central Asia; Central Europe; child; controlled study; demography; Eastern Europe; education; Europe; female; fertility; global disease burden; groups by age; highest income group; human; male; mortality rate; North America; priority journal; school child; sex ratio; social aspect; South and Central America; suicide; uncertainty; very elderly; Western Europe","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061305951
