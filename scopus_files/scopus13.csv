These irregularities could indicate a chaotic system and be measured by Lyapunov exponents. We define a functional λ (an ""irregularity index"") that is close to the (maximal) Lyapunov exponent for dynamical systems and well defined for series with a random component: this allows one to work with sunspot numbers. We compute λ for the daily WN from 1850 to 2012 within 4 yr sliding windows: λ exhibit sharp maxima at solar minima and secondary maxima at solar maxima. This pattern is reflected in the ratio R of the amplitudes of the main versus secondary peaks. Two regimes have alternated in the past 150 yr, R1 from 1850 to 1915 (large λ and R values) and R2 from 1935 to 2005 (shrinking difference between main and secondary maxima, R values between 1 and 2). We build an autoregressive model consisting of Poisson noise plus an 11 yr cycle and compute its irregularity index. The transition from R1 to R2 can be reproduced by strengthening the autocorrelation a of the model series. The features of the two regimes are stable for model and WN with respect to embedding dimension and delay. Near the time of the last solar minimum (2008), the irregularity index exhibits a peak similar to the peaks observed before 1915. This might signal a regime change back from R2 to R1 and the onset of a significant decrease of solar activity. © 2013. The American Astronomical Society.

Since there is a growing number of users of mobile Web browsers, we focused our study on the effects of different devices (PC or cell phone) in Web surveys on the respondents' willingness to report sensitive information. To reduce selection bias, we carried out a two-wave cross-over experiment using a volunteer online access-panel in Russia. Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire in both survey modes: PC and mobile Web survey. We hypothesized that features of mobile Web usage may affect response accuracy and lead to more socially desirable responses compared to the PC Web survey mode. We found significant differences in the reporting of alcohol consumption by mode, consistent with our hypothesis. But other sensitive questions did not show similar effects. We also found that the presence of familiar bystanders had an impact on the responses, while the presence of strangers did not have any significant effect in either survey mode.

A single slot is a time span that can be assigned to a task, which is a part of a job. The job launch requires a co-allocation of a specified number of slots starting synchronously. The challenge is that slots associated with different resources of distributed computational environments may have arbitrary start and finish points that do not match. Some existing algorithms assign a job to the first set of slots matching the resource request without any optimization (the first fit type), while other algorithms are based on an exhaustive search. In this paper, algorithms for effective slot selection of linear complexity on an available slots number are studied and compared with known approaches. The novelty of the proposed approach consists of allocating alternative sets of slots. It provides possibilities to optimize job scheduling. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","batch; Distributed computing; economic scheduling; job; resource management; slot; task","batch; Economic scheduling; job; Resource management; slot; task; Complex networks; Distributed computer systems; Optimization; Parallel architectures; Scheduling; Clustering algorithms","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890038853

Focusing on the post-communist world, and comparing it to more ""developed"" societies, this book reveals the mixed effects of capitalist culture on interpersonal relationships. While most observers blame the egoism and asocial behavior found in new free-market societies on their communist pasts, this work shows how relationships are also threatened by the profit orientations and personal ambition unleashed by economic development. Successful people in societies as diverse as China, Russia, and Eastern Germany adjust to the market economy at a social cost, relaxing their morals in order to obtain success and succumbing to increased material temptations to exploit relationships for their own financial and professional gain. The capitalist personality is internally troubled as a result of this ""sellout,"" but these qualms subside as it devalues intimate qualitative bonds with others. This book also shows that post-communists are similarly individualized as people living in Western societies. Capitalism may indeed favor values of independence, creativity, and self-expressiveness, but it also rewards self-centeredness, consumerism, and the stripping down of morality. As is the case in the West, capitalist culture fosters an internally conflicted and self-centered personality in post-communist societies. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

PAIS can generate large data logs that contain information about the interaction of processes in time. Studying PAIS logs with the purpose of data mining and modeling lies within the scope of Process Mining. There is a number of tools developed for Process Mining, including the most ubiquitous ProM, whose functionality is extended by plugins. To perform an object-aware experiment one has to sequentially run multiple plugins. This process becomes extremely time-consuming in the case of large-scale experiments involving a large number of plugins. The paper proposes a concept of DPMine/P language of process modeling and analysis to be implemented in ProM. The language under development aims at joining separate stages of the experiment into a single sequence, that is an experiment model.

Being understood in that sense, montage became an international ""grand style"" of the post-WWI epoch. In the Soviet Union this new method had many ideological connotations. It represented history (the historical process as such) as creative and cruel violence. Otherwise, art montage was a method of designing the utopian vision. The following development of montage in Russian culture could be defined as a change of its semantic. It was expelled from the Socialist Realism mainstream (excluding poster graphics), but survived in unofficial art of the 1940s and became postutopian. During the ""Thaw"" period (the late 1950s to the early 1960s) montage methods could indicate the connection of an author with the Soviet or Western European avant-garde of the 1920s. The reconsideration of those methods followed two different ways: imitation of the ""resurrection of revolutionary impulses"" or deconstruction of Soviet historical and social imagination - also with the tools of montage. This very intensive dialogue with the aesthetic tradition of the 1920s came to an end at the beginning of the 1970s. The authors of uncensored art and literature in that period polemicized not with the 1920s, but with the 1960s. The ""living"" translation of the early Soviet montage aesthetics has been settled.","Heterogeneity; Montage poetry; Montage prose; Periodization; Soviet literature",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894171809

The central aim of this paper is to examine one of the most important concepts in Peirce's theory related to design praxis: the concept of abduction. Abduction is the driving force behind creation and a way of producing new ideas. Peirce's original concept is fundamental in order to maintain constant commitment to innovation required by design. To transmit messages in a creative way it is more effi cient to intensely work with associations by similarity in order to obtain signs rich in information and analogies. Design communicates by all its constituent elements: shape, function, colour, material, technique, technology, etc. Therefore, signs of design share peculiar values of artistic signs as well as those of communicative ones. The associated information is as much aesthetic (shape) as it is semantic (content). The appropriation of Peircean concepts contributes to the understanding of the creative process, which in turn is crucial for understanding new possibilities by means of design.","Abduction; Design innovation; Peircean semiotics; Perception",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84894156602

This approach has some similarities with well known ""island model"" of GA. In both methods is used a migration of individuals from agents (""islands"") to the main process (""continent""). In contrast, the intelligent agents in MAGAMO are able to decompose the dimensions space to form evolutions of subpopulations (instead of distribution of initial population as in the standard ""island model""). In the same time, the main (central) process is responsible for the coordination of agents only and their selection according Pareto rules (without evolution). Intelligent agents seek local suboptimal solutions for a global optimization, which will be completed in the result of the interaction of all agents. In the result of this, the amount of needed recalculating the fitnessfunctions can be significantly reduced.

We apply the rolling intervals technique in the sample of more than 400 DJIA crashes in 1896-2011 and repeatedly use the data on 100 sequent crashes to estimate a family of ACD models and calculate forecasts of the one following crash. It appears that the ACD models provide significant predictive power when combined with the inter-event waiting time technique.

Declare models impose constraints instead of explicitly stating event orders. Constraints can impose various choices and ordering of events; constraints typically have understandable names, but for details, refer to [5]. Current state-of-the-art mining tends to fail due to a computational explosion, and employ filtering to reduce this. Our tool is not intended to provide user-readable models, but instead to provide all constraints satisfied by a model. This allows post-processing to weed out uninteresting constraints, potentially obtaining better resulting models than making filtering beforehand out of necessity. Any post-processing (and complexity-reducing filtering) possible with existing miners is also possible with the UnconstrainedMiner; our miner just allows more intelligent post-processing due to having more information available, such as interactive filtering of models. In our demonstration, we show how the new miner can handle large event logs in short time, and how the resulting output can be imported into Excel for further processing. Our intended audience is researchers interested in Declare mining and users interested in abstract characterization of relationships between events. We explicitly do not target end-users who wish to see a Declare model for a particular log (but we are happy to demonstrate the miner on other concrete data).",,"End-users; Event logs; Excel; Interactive filtering; Post processing; Enterprise resource management; Miners; Tools; Information filtering","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897713964

Propositions about factors affecting intensity of ties between countries and configuration of their overall network are then derived from each of the models. These propositions are then tested against empirical data on two kinds of academic ties: volumes of international student flows between pairs of countries (UNESCO statistics) and number of co-authored papers (Web of Science database). Negative binomial regression is used to estimate influence of various independent variables (funding of science, distance, historical experience of dependency) about the significance of which the models make different predictions.

Such event data are the starting point for process mining - an emerging scientific discipline relating modeled and observed behavior. The relevance of process mining is increasing as more and more event data become available. The increasing volume of such data ('Big Data') provides both opportunities and challenges for process mining. In this paper we focus on two particular types of process mining: process discovery (learning a process model from example behavior recorded in an event log) and conformance checking (diagnosing and quantifying discrepancies between observed behavior and modeled behavior). These tasks become challenging when there are hundreds or even thousands of different activities and millions of cases. Typically, process mining algorithms are linear in the number of cases and exponential in the number of different activities. This paper proposes a very general divide-and-conquer approach that decomposes the event log based on a partitioning of activities. Unlike existing approaches, this paper does not assume a particular process representation (e.g., Petri nets or BPMN) and allows for various decomposition strategies (e.g., SESE- or passage-based decomposition). Moreover, the generic divide-and-conquer approach reveals the core requirements for decomposing process discovery and conformance checking problems. © 2013 Polish Information Processing Society.",,"Conformance checking; Decomposition strategy; Divide-and-conquer approach; Operational process; Process Discovery; Process Modeling; Process representation; Scientific discipline; Algorithms; Computer science; Decomposition; Information systems; Petri nets; Data mining","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892496768

A literature survey shows that the most appropriate techniques for long-term ILI & ARI morbidity projections are the following well-known statistical methods: simple averaging of observations, point-to-point linear estimates, Serfling-type regression models, autoregressive models such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, and generalized exponential smoothing using the Holt-Winters approach. Using these methods and official data on the total number of ILI & ARI cases per week in 2000-2012 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Yakutsk, we developed one-year projections and evaluated their accuracy. Different methods yielded the best results, depending on the time series. Generally, it is preferable to use the Serfling model. The Serfling model forecasts almost matched the point-to-point linear estimates. In certain cases, ARIMA outperformed the Serfling model. Simple averaging can ensure a fairly good prediction when the ILI & ARI time series do not exhibit a trend.

However, this cannot solve the tension between universalism and contextualization of values that Sen has inherited from Smith. Based on recent Hegel scholarship, we argue that some of the difficulties can be resolved, considering the role Smith played in the development of Hegel's thinking. Hegel's concept of recognition plays an essential role in establishing the possibility of impartiality both on the level of consciousness and on the level of institutional intersubjectivity. Hegel's critique of Kant's formalist ethics (also considered as transcendental institutionalism by Sen) and his analysis of the civil society in the Philosophy of Right, especially his focus on associations and Estates, can serve as a model for making Sen's focus on public discourse theoretically more concise and pragmatically feasible.

We investigate the links between media, public opinion and foreign policy. In our content analysis of the coverage in two major USnewspapers, we find that the framing of the conflict was anti-Russia, especially in the initial stages of the conflict. In addition, our survey results demonstrate that an increase in the media exposure of US respondents increased the likelihood of blaming Russia exclusively in the conflict. This case study helps us understand how media can be powerful in constructing a certain narrative of an international conflict, which can then affect public perceptions of other countries. We believe that the negative framing of Russia in the US media has had important implications for the already-tenuous relations between the US and Russia by reviving and perpetuating the Cold War mentality for the public as well as for foreign policymakers. © 2013 The Regents of the University of California.","Cold War mentality; Media framing; Public opinion; Russia-Georgia war; US-Russia relations",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888429689

The two most prominent process mining tasks are: (i) process discovery: learning a process model from example behavior recorded in an event log, and (ii) conformance checking: diagnosing and quantifying discrepancies between observed behavior and modeled behavior. The increasing volume of event data provides both opportunities and challenges for process mining. Existing process mining techniques have problems dealing with large event logs referring to many different activities. Therefore, we propose a generic approach to decompose process mining problems. The decomposition approach is generic and can be combined with different existing process discovery and conformance checking techniques.

The problem of service integration challenges modern companies taking the risk of implementing SOA. One of important aspects of this problem relates to dynamic service composition, which has to take into account many types of information and restrictions existing in each enterprise. Moreover, all the changes in business logic should also be promptly reflected. This chapter proposes the approach to solution of the stated problem based on such concepts as model-driven architecture (MDA), ontology modelling and logical analysis. The approach consists of several steps of modelling and finite scope logical analysis for automated translation of business processes into the sequence of service invocations. Formal language of relational logic is proposed as a key element of the proposed approach which is responsible for logical analysis and service workflow generation. We present a logical theory to automatically specialize generic orchestration templates which are close to semantic specification of abstract services in OWL-S. The developed logical theory is described formally in terms of Relational Logic.

Mainstream workflow management systems predominantly use procedural languages having a graphical representation involving AND/XOR splits and joins (e.g., using BPMN). However, there are interesting alternative approaches. For example, case handling approaches are data-driven and allow users to deviate within limits, and declarative languages based on temporal logic (where everything is allowed unless explicitly forbidden). Recently, Rinus Plasmeijer proposed the iTask system (iTasks) based on the viewpoint that workflow modeling is in essence a particular kind of functional programming. This provides advantages in terms of expressiveness, extendibility, and implementation efficiency. On the occasion of his 61st birthday, we compare four workflow paradigms: procedural, case handling, declarative, and functional. For each paradigm we selected a characteristic workflow management system: YAWL (procedural), BPM|one (case handling), Declare (declarative), and iTasks (functional).

The apraxia classification developed by Luria, the classification of movements widely discussed in neurocognitive tradition, and Bernstein's level structure of the motor act are presented schematically. The strengths and limitations of each of these scientific schools are discussed. The principles of apraxia assessment in Luria's and the neurocognitive framework are analyzed. We conclude that Luria's approach and the neurocognitive tradition of apraxia investigation are quite similar. Bernstein's ideas were formed more than fifty years ago, but seem insightful and fruitful today. According to Bernstein, voluntary movements have some essential features that are not currently taken under consideration. From his point of view, movements are meaningful (determined by a motor task), holistic, hierarchic, dynamic and creative. These postulates were discussed in many of his now-classic works. At the same time we must confess that they are not widely known among clinicians. That is why we believe that Bernstein's concepts can significantly enrich our knowledge in the neuropsychology of praxis.","Apraxia assessment; Bernstein; Level theory of motor acts; Luria; Neurocognitive models of praxis","apraxia; brain function; brain region; clinical research; cognition; comparative study; feedback system; human; manual kinesthetic apraxia; mental function; motor performance; neuropsychology; research; review; Russian Federation; theory; voluntary movement","English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892386022

It examines four different theoretical perspectives used in studies of service innovation: assimilation, demarcation, inversion and integration/synthesis. Each of these throws light on particular issues confronting public services innovation, and we see that innovation in this sphere is highly diverse and that it does often display special features.

We present the conceptual framework and findings from empirical studies that examine the reciprocal acculturation and intercultural relations between migrants and members of the larger society. We analyze these studies with respect to their relevance to three hypotheses that have been advanced for examining intercultural relations: the multiculturalism hypothesis; the integration hypothesis; and contact hypothesis. Findings of the studies showed that measures of security, identity, perceived threat/discrimination have a significant relationship with ethnic tolerance, mutual attitudes, acculturation strategies and expectations, and the well-being and life satisfaction of both immigrants and members of the larger society.

The study is conducted against the backdrop of certain assumptions regarding the cross-cultural centrality and marginality of emotions as formulated in the current research on cross-cultural pragmatics. The paper employs corpus-based methods to test the frequencies of the linguistic expression of different types of emotions in Russian and American English as encountered in diagnostic contexts of first-person reporting. Contrary to many currently accepted theories, the present study demonstrates no absolute prevalence of positive or ethical over negative or non-ethical emotions in Russian or American English. It also disproves certain more specific claims (the predominance of 'pity' in Russian), while confirming others (prominence of 'shame' in Russian). Certain tendencies in emotional etiquette lean toward cross-cultural universality (e.g., 'gratitude' as the most frequently expressed emotion), while others differ. Overall, Russian speakers tend to report more passive negative emotions ('fear'), while English speakers prefer reporting active negative emotions ('anger'). Russian speakers are more ""self-deprecating"" than English speakers, as they favor expressing 'shame' over 'pride.' At the same time, they show less empathy with the addressee, reporting more 'contempt'-like and less 'pity'-like emotions. The results obtained in this study can be useful for understanding and formulating culturally specific pragmatic peculiarities and hence preferred conversational strategies in the two languages. © 2013 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.","corpus research; emotion cluster; emotion subtype; emotional etiquette; etiquette maxim; frequency",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890388729

Since 2010 the government has conducted a kind of «incumbent» policy approach, encouraging mainly the largest state-owned companies. The latter are obliged to elaborate and implement innovation development programmes (IDPs) in order to accelerate modernization of the Russian economy and increase demand for innovation. This paper analyzes the results of the monitoring of STI activities undertaken by the state-owned companies in relation to implementation of innovative development programmes. It evaluates the interim results of government initiatives to foster innovation in the related business segment, notes the negative effects of excessive «compulsion» to innovate and provides recommendations for improving policy. Monitoring shows that the actual priority for most companies is modernization of fixed assets through acquisition of modern machinery and equipment. Technology adoption, along with R&D investments, significantly surpasses other possible mechanisms encouraging innovative development (including support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), education and training in innovation, co-operation with other actors in the framework of technology platforms, venture funding). The innovation outputs of the surveyed group of companies are in fact comparable to the Russian average although monitoring does not allow the assessment of corporate patent strategies or the novelty of innovative products that are produced and exported. The author argues that the fundamental policy effect through organizational changes and investments may manifest itself in the next decade. However, the quality of the corporate management, employee loyalty to structural change and organisational culture that supports innovation, would likely be more important in enhancing overall performance. Policy recommendations include: differentiation of government incentives according to the companies' specificities, development of their external linkages with SMEs and universities, linking innovation strategies to corporate policies, and integration of IDPs into the roadmaps of technological development of Russian regions and markets.","Coercion to innovation; Innovation performance; Innovative development programme; State-owned company",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887037228

Since 2010 in Russia, an initiative has been undertaken to establish a National Software Platform (a set of applications based on Open Source) which, it is presumed, will be compulsorily embedded into the system of public administration. The paper assesses the efficiency of government policy in the field of Open Source and provides recommendations for its improvement. Analyzing the specifics of the software market, that is, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the two main types of software - proprietary («closed»), and open - As well as «extreme» types in regard to the latter (direct stimulation or complete disengagement of the government from regulating the users' choice), the authors conclude that any extreme policy approach is hardly relevant to the considered field. One should take into account the development not only of the software, but also the whole complex of complementary assets that are factors in the economic impact of innovation. The joint work of suppliers and customers in introducing new technologies (co-invention) creates a synergy that is the key to the effective use of ICT in the economy and development of the sector as a whole. Therefore, protectionism (fostering manufacturers at the cost of limiting consumer choice) is fundamentally inconsistent with the specifics of the ICT industry, and the compulsory transition to the new type of software will lead to a significant loss in terms of «switching costs» and benefits of network effects. At the same time, the indirect measures, including information sharing and support for users of open standards, expands customer choice and reduces the costs of switching from one to another software type. It is these mechanisms that are not just compatible with the specifics of the market, but also allow maximum benefits, both for producers and consumers.","Co-invention; Information and communication technologies; Network effects; Open source software; Proprietary software; Switching costs; Virtual networks",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887051072

These techniques are interdisciplinary, drawing primarily on advances in medicine, pharmacology, nutrition, mobile communications, neuroscience and cognitive sciences. This paper provides examples of such developments, analyzes their contribution to the expansion of human capabilities and, consequently, implications for the future working environment. It addresses ethical issues and risks associated with human enhancement technologies, in particular, the emergence of the new social divide - between the users of such technologies and people lacking access to them. Finally, it discusses some wild cards that may cause future surprises and shocks, i.e. machines that can control a human-excluded world, a virtual level of human life that dominates real life.

This paper conceptualizes about an architectural framework specifically designed for explaining and representing the working environment of enterprise operating systems (EOS) and non-EOS information systems (IS) that depend on it. With these concerns in mind, the goal of EOS is to capture and control all phenomena that occur in an organization and then to provide all the required data for all IS for that organization. Using a computer engineering metaphor, this paper defines the theoretical foundations, and the methodology to design and implement an operating system for organizations. To achieve this, EOS is a model-driven dynamically. The models are based on domain ontology with C4-ness qualities and expressed in ontological language. It will be shown that the theory of enterprise ontology and the DEMO methodology provide a high degree of ontological appropriateness for this domain. This paper, outline a framework with its foundations, concepts, principles and stratification of IS, which is a radical new approach, useful to discussion this solution among the practitioners.

The goal of the policy was to improve the quality of intercultural relations. Two main elements of the policy were proposed as steps towards achieving this goal: support for the maintenance and development of cultural communities (the cultural component); and promotion of intercultural contact along with the reduction of barriers to such participation (the intercultural component). Research on these issues can provide a basis for the development and implementation of multiculturalism policies and programmes. A review of psychological research on multiculturalism over the past 40 years is summarised. Topics include: knowledge about the multiculturalism policy; acceptance of multiculturalism; acceptance of ethnocultural groups; acceptance of immigrants; discrimination and exclusion; and attachment and identity. Research assessing three hypotheses derived from the policy is also briefly reviewed. Current evidence is that there is widespread support for these features of the multicultural way of living in Canada. Of particular importance for the success of multiculturalism is the issue of social cohesion: is the first component (the promotion of cultural diversity) compatible with the second component (the full and equitable participation and inclusion of all ethnocultural groups in civic society)? If they are compatible, together do they lead to the attainment of the fundamental goal of attaining positive intercultural relations? Current psychological evidence suggests that these two components are indeed compatible, and that when present, they are associated with mutual acceptance among ethnocultural groups in Canada. I conclude that research in Canada supports the continuation of the multiculturalism policy and programmes that are intended to improve intercultural relations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Acculturation; Contact; Cultural maintenance; Ethnocultural groups; Immigrants; Intercultural relations; Public attitudes; Public policy; Social cohesion",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888430145

The pivotal elements of Hegelian social ontology are the continuity thesis, the performativity thesis, and the recognition thesis, which, when taken together, imply that all mental processes are essentially dependent on externalizations, with the underlying pattern of actions being performative. In turn, performative action is impossible without mutual recognition in an intersubjective domain.

This paper discusses a stochastic unit commitment model which takes into account various uncertainties affecting thermal energy demand and two types of power generators, i.e., quick-start and non-quick-start generators.

The data allow tracing key trends in fisheries development and in the abundance of major commercial species. In particular, results showed that, over time, the main fishing areas moved from the middle part of rivers downstream towards and onto the coastal sea. Changes in fishing patterns were closely interrelated with changes in the abundance of exploited fish. Anadromous species, such as Atlantic sturgeon, Atlantic salmon, brown trout, whitefish, vimba bream, smelt, lamprey, and catadromous eel were the most important commercial fish in the area because they were abundant, had high commercial value and were easily available for fishing in rivers. Due to intensive exploitation and other human-induced factors, populations of most of these species had declined notably by the early 20th century and have now lost commercial significance. The last sturgeon was caught in 1996, and today only smelt and lamprey support small commercial fisheries. According to historical sources, catches of freshwater species such as roach, ide, pike, perch, ruffe and burbot regularly occurred, in some areas exceeding half of the total catch, but they were not as important as migrating fish and no clear trends in abundance are apparent. Of documented marine catch, Baltic herring appeared in the 16th century, but did not become commercially significant until the 19th century.

An approach to estimate the exact number of attributes and the parameters of the model in a given class of utility functions for each attribute was proposed.

However, this effect is reciprocal: companies that generate higher cash flow can invest more in IC. The purpose of this paper is to analyze a dynamic relationship between IC components and economic profit, with a special emphasis on industry specific effects in pharmaceutical, retail, steel, telecommunications, and service sectors. Design/methodology/approach: Panel vector autoregression was used to deal with the mutual influence of IC components, the lag effect, and heterogeneity. The data were taken from Compustat database and covers the period from 2001 to 2010. Findings: The paper proves that there is interaction between investments in the IC components and company performance. However, there are sectoral differences: there is a positive impact of economic profit on human capital in retail; in the steel industry a mutual influence is revealed. Moreover, interaction between different IC components is detected in telecommunication and steel industries. Originality/value: This is the first study to present clear evidence of the effects of performance on IC investment decisions. The time lag in the effects of IC investments was estimated and compared for different industries. On the methodological side, the paper presents a rather simple method capable of yielding results consistent with other studies and yet rich enough to be applied to an analysis of sectoral differences in dynamic IC investment decisions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Financial performance; Intellectual capital; Interaction effect; Vector autoregression",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885436975

Also, Kyrgyzstan's mortality fluctuations have had smaller amplitude. This has occurred in spite of worse macro-economic outcomes in Kyrgyzstan. To understand these surprising patterns, we analyzed cause-specific mortality in Kyrgyzstan vs. Russia for the period 1981-2010, using unpublished official data. We find that, as in Russia, fluctuations in Kyrgyzstan have been primarily due to changes in external causes and circulatory causes, and alcohol appears to play an important role. However, in contrast with Russia, mortality from these causes in Kyrgyzstan has been lower and has increased by a smaller amount. As a result, the mortality gap between the two countries is overwhelmingly attributable to external and cardio-vascular causes, and more generally, to causes that have been shown to be strongly related to alcohol consumption. These cause-specific results, together with the existence of large ethnic differentials in mortality in Kyrgyzstan, highlight the importance of cultural and religious differences, and their impact on patterns of alcohol consumption, in explaining the mortality gap between the two countries.

The main drawback of such ratings is that they only provide a linear ordering of countries by averaging a multitude of criteria. Such approach does not make it obvious which particular problems exist in which countries and thus does not help comparing democratic processes in different countries. In this paper, we propose a multidimensional model for ratings based on the mathematical discipline of formal concept analysis, which deals, in particular, with automated taxonomy construction from object-attribute data. In our case, every node of a taxonomy would group countries similar in certain aspects, while at the same time providing a description of these aspects. The aim is not to question the existing ratings, but rather to provide a neutral instrument for uncovering the structure of the data underlying these ratings. The proposed representation is much more informative than linear ratings, since it shows the commonalities and differences in the democratic development of various countries.

One such property is the fact that the discriminant is always a hypersurface in the space of systems of equations (which seems unexpected when compared to the existence of dual defect toric varieties). This fact reflects the combinatorics of a certain partial order relation on the set of tuples of faces of a tuple of polytopes (the Newton polytopes of the equations in our case), generalizing the poset of faces of one polytope. This combinatorics is the main challenge in our work, and can be reduced to a certain fact of tropical geometry, which resembles the geometry of the discriminants that we study. As a sample application of our version of the multivariate discriminant, we prove that atypical fibers of a generic polynomial map are distinguished by their Euler characteristics, and the bifurcation set of such a map is a hypersurface, whose degree we explicitly compute. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bifurcation set; Discriminant; Dual defect; Polytope; Purity; Tropical geometry",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880614974

By mapping of local continuous feature vectors to a discrete range, this problem is reduced to statistical classification of a set of discrete finite patterns. It is demonstrated that the Bayesian decision under the assumption that probability distributions can be estimated using the Parzen kernel and the Gaussian window with a fixed variance for all the classes, implemented in the PNN, is not optimal in the classification of a set of patterns. We presented here the novel modification of the PNN with homogeneity testing which gives an optimal solution of the latter task under the same assumption about probability densities. By exploiting the discrete nature of patterns our modification prevents the well-known drawbacks of the memory-based approach implemented in both the PNN and the PNN with homogeneity testing, namely, low classification speed and high requirements to the memory usage. Our modification only requires the storage and processing of the histograms of input and training samples. We present the results of an experimental study in two practically important tasks: (1) the problem of Russian text authorship attribution with character n-grams features; and (2) face recognition with well-known datasets (AT&T, FERET and JAFFE) and comparison of color- and gradient-orientation histograms.

The tsunami wave attacked the Oarai port of Ibaraki prefecture within 30 minutes, and created an enormous vortex flow within the harbor. A similar feature was observed in the Imwon port, in the Eastern Korean coast during the 1983 tsunami event in the East (Japan) Sea. A set of simulations have been performed to investigate the generation of the powerful vortex caused by the 2011 tsunami event at the Oarai Port. The application of numerical models has successfully reproduced the formation of the vortex in the center of the port, which can be clearly identified in a photograph taken during the tsunami. The simulation of tsunami generation and propagation at the outer sea is performed with a hydrostatic model and, for the investigation of a more detailed transient pattern of water flows, the model which uses full Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations is applied. Examination of the Oarai and Imwon vortexes implies that the generation and strength of a vortex due to tsunami wave is strongly related in the size and the shape of port and breakwater layouts.

The minimum size of the small asteroid is determined by the ability to detect it and to determine its orbit. Near-Earth asteroids (NEA's) are selected from those that have a fly-by distance from Earth of the order of hundreds of thousands of kilometers. According to current estimates, the number of near Earth asteroids with such sizes is very large, making it possible to find the required small asteroid. Further, the possibility is evaluated of changing the small asteroid's orbit so that, by application of a very limited ΔV impulse, the object is targeted to a gravity assist maneuver (Earth swingby) that puts it on a collision course with a dangerous asteroid. In order to apply the required ΔV impulse, it is necessary to install on the small asteroid an appropriate propulsion system with required propellant mass. A control system similar to that used on a spacecraft is also necessary. The Keck study has already shown the feasibility of performing the above steps to change the orbit of similar asteroids to target them to a lunar orbit; our idea is similar in orbital energetics to that, only for slightly larger objects and targeting them to an Earth B-plane point rather than the vicinity of the Moon. Of course, any real test of this (or of any other deflection) strategy should first be performed on a benign asteroid whose orbital parameters give the asteroid no significant chance of a natural impact with the Earth during at least the next million years, even in the case of small changes in its orbit.",,"Basic concepts; Collision course; Current estimates; Gravity assist maneuvers; Near-earth asteroids; Orbital parameters; Propellant mass; Propulsion system; Flight control systems; Moon; Orbits; Asteroids","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883667817

Because of its success, a short version of the PVQ was introduced in the European Social Survey (ESS). However, initial tests using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) pointed to low discriminant validity of the 10 basic values: The correlations between values next to each other in the two-dimensional space described by SSA were close to or greater than 1. In response, one research stream suggested combining the factors with low discriminant validity. Another stream suggested that the problem was not low discriminant validity but rather misspecifications in the model. Analyses of the short Portrait Values Questionnaire of the ESS confirmed the latter view. This paper demonstrates that the problems of the short version of the PVQ exist in the full 40-item PVQ as well. Based on SEM analyses of the items of the full PVQ, we propose that it can provide measures of 15 more narrowly defined values with good discriminant validity. Our proposal respects the conceptual complexity of the values theory while avoiding contamination of composite scores. It can be expected that the improved measurement of 15 values will increase their predictive power. The presence of some single items suggests the extension of the value theory and scales to encompass more than 15 values.

After 1990, a massive privatization of housing was achieved first through the transfer of stock from industrial companies to municipalities and then through no-cost transfer of ownership to the tenants. Despite privatization, a large amount of housing stock has since been unloaded back onto municipalities who now find themselves owners of 11% of all housing in Russia (much more in some regions). The poor quality of stock and the inability of the new owners to meet maintenance costs have led to a growing housing role for local authorities, who have many new responsibilities and expectations from residents, but few resources. Although the situation has parallels in other post-socialist countries, the scale in Russia is greater, and there is no EU aid, nor any tradition either of ownership or collective responsibility. Economic crisis in Europe and a slow down in housing construction in Russia mean that new policies for rental housing are needed. This review considers historic and recent changes in housing policy in the Russian Federation in light of the emerging housing role of municipal governments.

We consider the possibility that these waves propagate without reflection although there is some inhomogeneity. We briefly describe the general theory of non-reflective, one-dimensional wave propagation in inhomogeneous media. This theory is then applied to kink-wave propagation in coronal loops. We consider a coronal loop of half-circle shape embedded in an isothermal atmosphere, and assume that the plasma temperature is the same inside and outside the loop. We show that non-reflective kink-wave propagation is possible for a particular dependence of the loop radius on the distance along the loop. A viable assumption that the loop radius increases from the loop footpoint to the apex imposes a lower limit on the loop expansion factor, which is the ratio of the loop radii at the apex and footpoints. This lower limit increases with the loop height; however, even for a loop that is twice as high as the atmospheric scale height, it is small enough to satisfy observational constraints. Hence, we conclude that non-reflective propagation of kink waves is possible in a fairly realistic model of coronal loops. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corona; Coronal magnetic loops; Wave reflection; Waves",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877752148

The dynamics of the offshore-propagating wave in linearly inclined bays of different cross-section are also studied asymptotically for the resonant moving landslide.

Our construction largely exploits specific properties of the Thoma cone related to its representation-theoretic origin, although we do not use representations directly. On the other hand, we were inspired by analogies with random matrix theory coming from models of Markov dynamics related to orthogonal polynomial ensembles. We show that processes X(z;z') possess a number of nice properties, namely: (1) every X(z;z') is a Feller process; (2) the infinitesimal generator of X(z;z'), its spectrum, and the eigenfunctions admit an explicit description; (3) in the equilibrium regime, the finite-dimensional distributions of X(z;z') can be interpreted as (the laws of) infinite-particle systems with determinantal correlations; (4) the corresponding time-dependent correlation kernel admits an explicit expression, and its structure is similar to that of time-dependent correlation kernels appearing in random matrix theory.","Determinantal processes; Feller processes; Laguerre polynomials; Markov intertwiners; Meixner polynomials; Thoma cone; Thoma simplex",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881644432

Control-flow is either modeled explicitly as flow of a specific kind of data, or implicit based on the data-flow. Explicit modeling of control-flow is useful for well-known and highly structured processes, but may make modeling of abstract features of models, or processes which are highly dynamic, overly complex. Declarative modeling, such as is supported by Declare and DCR graphs, focus on control-flow, but does not specify it explicitly; instead specifications come in the form of constraints on the order or appearance of tasks. In this paper we propose a combination of the two, using colored Petri nets instead of plain Petri nets to provide full data support. The combined approach makes it possible to add a focus on data to declarative languages, and to remove focus from the explicit control-flow from Petri nets for dynamic or abstract processes. In addition to enriching both procedural processes in the form of Petri nets and declarative processes, we also support a flow from modeling only abstract data- and control-flow of a model towards a more explicit control-flow model if so desired. We define our combined approach, and provide considerations necessary for enactment.

Although process mining has been applied in hundreds of organizations and process mining techniques have been embedded in a variety of commercial tools, to date these techniques have rarely been used for analyzing web services. One of the obvious reasons is that cross-organizational event data cannot be shared easily. However, (1) messages exchanged between services tend to be structured, (2) service-orientation continues to be the predominant implementation paradigm, and (3) the most substantial efficiency gains can often only be achieved across different organizations. Hence, there are many possible applications for service mining, i.e., applying process mining techniques to services. If messages are recorded, then one can discover a process describing interactions between services. If, in addition, descriptive or normative models are available, one can use process mining to check conformance and highlight performance problems.

To obtain such data the stepped tensile tests which allow obtaining the stress - strain rate dependence at a given temperature are ideal. The experiments conducted consist of the tensile test series at various temperatures with stepped change of the deformation rate. By the results of these tests the constitutive equations, which describe relationship between stress and strain rate for each temperature, were obtained.

Furthermore, few aphasia tests in languages other than English have been standardised and normed, and few have supportive psychometric data pertaining to reliability and validity. The lack of standardised assessment tools across many of the world's languages poses serious challenges to clinical practice and research in aphasia. Aims: The current review addresses this lack of assessment tools by providing conceptual and statistical guidance for the development of aphasia assessment tools and establishment of their psychometric properties. Main Contribution: A list of aphasia tests in the 20 most widely spoken languages is included. The pitfalls of translating an existing test into a new language versus creating a new test are outlined. Factors to be considered in determining test content are discussed. Further, a description of test items corresponding to different language functions is provided, with special emphasis on implementing important controls in test design. Next, a broad review of principal psychometric properties relevant to aphasia tests is presented, with specific statistical guidance for establishing psychometric properties of standardised assessment tools. Conclusions: This article may be used to help guide future work on developing, standardising and validating aphasia language tests. The considerations discussed are also applicable to the development of standardised tests of other cognitive functions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Aphasia; Language assessment; Psychometrics; Reliability; Standardised testing; Test development; Validity","aphasia; clinical assessment tool; cognition; human; information dissemination; language ability; language processing; language test; linguistics; psychometry; review; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; speech; test retest reliability; validity; visual stimulation","English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882269676

For the principal series, unlike the complementary one, we can derive the kinetic equation from the system of Dyson-Schwinger equation, which allows us to sum up the leading infrared contributions from all loops. We find two peculiar solutions of the kinetic equation. One of them describes the stationary Gibbons-Hawking-type distribution for the density per comoving volume. Another solution shows explosive (square root of the pole in finite proper time) growth of the particle number density per comoving volume.

Despite the fact that legislator gave a new meaning to this procedure stage and despite the expectation that this procedure stage would play a new role in the process as a whole, many scientists in their research repeatedly considered the preparation stage as the subject of critical analysis. Indeed, large potential of stage of case preparation for trial, as well as the experience of civil procedure in foreign countries, was omitted by legislator. And no matter how insulting it could be, this procedure stage remains to be so for already more than ten years. Therefore, it seems reasonable to consider the very key points in the formation of case preparation as the procedure stage and as an institution of civil procedural law and to indicate the tendencies in the development of rules in this area. ©IDOSI Publications, 2013.","Law reform; Legal activity; Legal regulation",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879483589

Earth-based telescopes have found smaller harmless objects, such as 2008 TC3, a 4 m-asteroid that was discovered 20h before it exploded over northeastern Sudan (Jenniskens, 2009). 2008 TC3 remains the only asteroid discovered before it hit Earth because it approached Earth from the night side, where it was observed by large telescopes searching for near-Earth objects (NEO's). The larger object that exploded over Chelyabinsk approached Earth from the day side, from too close to the Sun to be detected from Earth. A sizeable telescope in an orbit about the Sun-Earth L1 (SE-L1) libration point could find objects like the ""Chelyabinsk"" asteroid approaching approximately from the line of sight to the Sun about a day before Earth closest approach. Such a system would have the astrometric accuracy needed to determine the time and impact zone for a NEO on a collision course. This would give at least several hours, and usually 2-4 days, to take protective measures, rather than the approximately two-minute interval between the flash and shock wave arrival that occurred in Chelyabinsk. A perhaps even more important reason for providing warning of these events, even smaller harmless ones that explode high in the atmosphere with the force of an atomic bomb, is to prevent mistaking such an event for a nuclear attack that could trigger a devastating nuclear war. A concept using a space telescope similar to that needed for an SE-L1 monitoring satellite, is already conceived by the B612 Foundation, whose planned Sentinel Space Telescope could find nearly all 140 m and larger NEO's, including those in orbits mostly inside the Earth's orbit that are hard to find with Earth-based telescopes, from a Venus-like orbit (Lu, 2013). Few modifications would be needed to the Sentinel Space Telescope to operate in a SE-L1 orbit, 0.01 AU from Earth towards the Sun, to find most asteroids larger than about 5 meters that approach the Earth from the solar direction. The spacecraft would scan 165 square degrees of the sky around the Earth every hour, finding asteroids when they are brightest (small phase angle) as they approach Earth. We will undertake Monte Carlo studies to see what fraction of asteroids 5 m and larger approaching from the Sun might be found by such a mission, and how much warning time might typically be expected. Also, we will check the overall coverage for all Earth-approaching NEO's, including ground-based observations and observations by the recently-launched NEOSSat, which may best fill any gaps in coverage between that provided by an SE-L1 telescope and ground-based surveys. Many of the objects as large as 50 m, like the one that created Meteor Crater in Arizona, will not be found by current NEO surveys, while they would usually be seen by this possible mission even if they approached from the direction of the Sun.

In particular, R-symmetric and R-skew-symmetric algebras of a linear space V equipped with a skew-invertible Hecke symmetry R are braided algebras. We prove the ""mountain property"" for the numerators and denominators of their Poincaré-Hilbert series (which are always rational functions). Also, we further develop a differential calculus on modified Reflection Equation algebras. Thus, we exhibit a new form of the Leibniz rule for partial derivatives on such algebras related to involutive symmetries R. In particular, we present this rule for the algebra U(gl(m)). The case of the algebra U(gl(2)) and its compact form U(u(2)) (which can be treated as a deformation of the Minkowski space algebra) is considered in detail. On the algebra U(u(2)) we introduce the notion of the quantum radius, which is a deformation of the usual radius, and compute the action of rotationally invariant operators and in particular of the Laplace operator. This enables us to define analogs of the Laplace-Beltrami operators corresponding to certain Schwarzschild-type metrics and to compute their actions on the algebra U(u(2)) and its central extension.

In order to be useful for policy deliberations, the measures of life satisfaction must be psychometrically sound. The reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of life satisfaction measures are reviewed. The scales are stable under unchanging conditions, but are sensitive to changes in circumstances in people's lives. Several types of data indicate that the scales validly reflect the quality of respondents' lives: (1) Differences between nations in life satisfaction associated with differences in objective conditions, (2) Differences between groups who live in different circumstances, (3) Correlations with nonself-report measures of life satisfaction, (4) Genetic and physiological associations with life satisfaction, (5) Systematic patterns of change in the scales before, during, and after significant life events, and (6) Prediction by life satisfaction scores of future behaviors such as suicide. The life satisfaction scales can be influenced by factors such as question order, current mood, and mode of presentation, but in most cases these can be controlled. Our model of life satisfaction judgments points to the importance of attention, values, standards, and top-down effects. Although the scales are useful in research on individual well-being, there are policy questions that need more analysis and research, such as which types of subjective well-being measures are most relevant to which types of policies, how standards influence scores, and how best to associate the scores with current policy deliberations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Global evaluations; Life satisfaction; Measurement; National policy; Quality of life; Reliability; Validity","behavioral response; policy approach; quality of life; socioeconomic indicator; theoretical study","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878541134

The main research question which lies behind my study is whether verbs derived by means of a derivational marker, for instance, a possibilitive one, behave in the course of other valencychanging operations differently from nonderived verbs. I will show that verb classification in Adyghe has some typologically peculiar properties, the main one being that the derivational classification distinguishes more specific classes than the purely morphological one. In other words, the fact that a verb is derived and how it is derived is crucial for its behavior. The language-specific properties of Adyghe are also typologically relevant.

It is shown that the multilingual pattern in the cluster is now shifting from the knowledge of neighbor languages towards Russian - an external lingua franca which is not native to any of the communicants. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Family interview; Language contacts; Languages of Daghestan; Multilingualism",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879592235

For the case of pairwise similarity the connection of this measure with the sign correlation of Fechner is noted. The properties of the proposed measure of pairwise similarity in comparison with the classic Pearson correlation are studied. The simple measure of pairwise similarity is applied (in parallel with the classic correlation) for the study of Russian and Swedish market graphs. The new measure of similarity for more than two random variables is introduced and applied to the additional deeper analysis of Russian and Swedish markets.

It is also in line with recent trends in the real sector of the economy, where public ownership has rebounded over the past decade. The core state-controlled banks have evolved into hybrid institutions, performing two various sets of functions: those of regular commercial banks and of policy banks.

Crisis reactions were significantly related to participation in international markets, although participation in trade, in external borrowing or FDI cannot explain recession by themselves. The reversal of growth was mainly caused by demand shock and, following that, by financial constraints.

Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is an important research area within computational linguistics. Opinion words, which form an opinion lexicon, describe the attitude of the author towards certain opinion targets, i.e., entities and their attributes on which opinions have been expressed. Hence, the availability of a representative opinion lexicon can facilitate the extraction of opinions from texts. For this reason, opinion word mining is one of the key issues in sentiment analysis. We designed and implemented several methods for extracting opinion words. We evaluated these approaches by testing how well the resulting opinion lexicons help improve the accuracy of methods for determining the polarity of the reviews if the extracted opinion words are used as features. We used several machine learning methods: SVM, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and KNN. By using the extracted opinion words as features we were able to improve over the baselines in some cases. Our experiments showed that, although opinion words are useful for polarity detection, they are not sufficient on their own and should be used only in combination with other features. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Sentiment Analysis","Domain specific; Key Issues; Logistic regressions; Machine learning methods; NAtural language processing; Opinion mining; Opinion targets; Sentiment analysis; Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Extraction; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Logistics; Natural language processing systems; Data mining","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875825722

Therefore, each nonconventional project always has two rates of return; that is, GIRR(p) and GERR(r), depending on the reinvestment and the finance rate, respectively. The GNPV, generalized internal rate of return (GIRR), and generalized external rate of return (GERR) rules for justifying and ranking independent nonconventional projects are proposed.

First, we test the relative importance of structural and actor-oriented factors using a specially constructed index of democracy. Cross-country regression analysis reveals that policy-related variables have higher statistical explanatory power: presidentialism vs. parliamentarism; opposition coming to power in the first founding elections; foreign policy orientation towards the West and state capture as the most significant variables. These findings are further corroborated and expanded by qualitative analysis. Following this we examine types of post-communist stateness as another possible explanation of differences in regime transformation results. We propose a vector measure of stateness which is based on both statistical data and expert evaluations. This measure allows us to develop a typology of stateness in post-communist countries which is used to assess the relationship between regime and stateness dynamics. We find that those post-communist states which fulfil a broad range of social functions are more successful in their democratic development. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","democratization; dynamics modelling; post-communist countries; regime transformations; Stateness",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890128080

Model parameters of the material were chosen to fit a typical polar organic photoconductor polycarbonate doped with 30 of aromatic hydrazone, whose transport properties are well documented in literature. Simulated carrier mobility demonstrates a usual Poole-Frenkel field dependence and its slope is very close to the experimental value without using any adjustable parameter. At room temperature transients are universal with respect to the electric field and transport layer thickness. At the same time, carrier mobility does not depend on the layer thickness and transients develop a well-defined plateau where the current does not depend on time, thus demonstrating a non-dispersive transport regime. Tails of the transients decay as power law with the exponent close to -2. This particular feature indicates that transients are close to the boundary between dispersive and non-dispersive transport regimes. Shapes of the simulated transients are in very good agreement with the experimental ones. In summary, we provide a first verification of a self-consistency of the dipolar glass transport model, where major transport parameters, extracted from the experimental transport data, are then used in the transport simulation, and the resulting mobility field dependence and transients are in very good agreement with the initial experimental data. © 2013 American Institute of Physics.",,"Adjustable parameters; Experimental datum; Experimental values; Monte Carlo simulations; Organic photoconductors; Simulated transients; Transport parameters; Transport simulation; Carrier mobility; Electric fields; Glass; Monte Carlo methods; Polycarbonates; Transients; Transport properties; Power quality","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875149797

The concept of the number of degrees of freedom, which relates the observable quantities listed above, is generalized to the case of low temperatures. An analogy between the creation and annihilation operators for pairs (dimers) and the creation and annihilation operators for particles (molecules) is carried out. A generalization of the concept of a Bose condensate is introduced for classical molecules as an analog of an ideal liquid (without attraction). The negative pressure in the liquid is treated as holes (of exciton type) in the density of the Bose condensate. The phase transition gas-liquid is calculated for an ideal gas (without attraction). A comparison with experimental data is carried out. In the other part of the paper, we introduce the concept of new observable quantity, namely, of a pair (a dimer), as a result of attraction between nearest neighbors. We treat in a new way the concepts of Boyle temperature TB(as the temperature above which the dimers disappear) and of the critical temperature Tc(below which the trimers and clusters are formed). The equation for the Zeno line is interpreted as the relation describing the dependence of the temperature on the density at which the dimers disappear. We calculate the maximal density of the liquid and also the maximal density of the holes.

Due to an extensive vocabulary of formally represented mental attitudes, communicative actions and accumulated library of behaviors, NL-MAMS is capable of yielding much richer set of sequences of mental state than a conventional system of reasoning about beliefs, desires and intentions would deliver. Also, NL-MAMS functions in domain-independent manner, outperforming machine learning-based systems for predicting behaviors of human agents in broad domains where training sets are limited. We evaluate the correctness, coverage and maximum complexity of the NL-MAMS and discuss its integration with other reasoning components and its application domains. The proposed component is intended to be integrated into eBay human behavior simulation system, predicting behavior of buyers and sellers in normal and conflict situations. Also, NL-MAMS can be a part of any software system where modeling of human users is necessary, such as a personalized assistant, a tutoring or decision support system, advisor, recommender and conflict resolver. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It charts the trajectory of academic writing on East European youth cultures and suggests the region's state socialist past (which made social inequalities relatively insignificant at a time when, elsewhere, youth cultural studies were dominated by class-based readings) combined with the explosion of inequality in the post-socialist period (by which time class-resistant post-subcultural theories led anglophone academic discussion), makes it an interesting vantage point from which to reconsider academic paradigms. Drawing on empirical examples of youth cultural practice in (post)-socialist Eastern Europe, it argues for a perspective that integrates structural and cultural factors shaping young people's lives. It suggests moving forward western theoretical debates - often stymied in arguments over nomenclature ('subculture', 'postsubculture', 'neo-tribe') - by shifting the focus of study from 'form' ('subculture' etc.) to 'substance' (concrete cultural practices) and attending to everyday communicative, musical, sporting, educational, informal economy, and territorial practices. Since such practices are embedded in the 'whole' rather than 'subcultural' lives of young people, this renders visible how cultural practices are enabled and constrained by the same social divisions and inequalities that structure society at large. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874068315

We test two predictions in the context of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). It is already known that the introduction of TRIA led to negative abnormal returns in the insurance industry. In addition, we show this negative effect is stronger for larger and for low-risk-averse firms-two results that are consistent with our model.

Methods: Cross-sectional and annual time-series data from 1870 to 1894, 2008 and 2009 on the mortality rate from deaths due to 'drunkenness' were compared for men in the 50 provinces of tsarist 'European Russia': an area that today corresponds with the territory occupied by the Baltic countries, Belarus, Moldova, Ukraine and the Russian provinces to the west of the Ural Mountains. Results: In 1870-1894, the male death rate from 'drunkenness' in the Russian provinces (15.9 per 100,000) was much higher than in the non-Russian provinces. However, the rate recorded in Russia in the contemporary period was even higher-23.3. Conclusions: Russia has had high levels of alcohol mortality from at least the late 19th century onwards. While a dangerous drinking pattern and spirits consumption may underpin high alcohol mortality across time, the seemingly much higher levels in the contemporary period seem to be also driven by an unprecedented level of consumption, and also possibly, surrogate alcohol use. This study highlights the urgent need to reduce the level of alcohol consumption among the population in order to reduce high levels of alcohol mortality in contemporary Russia. © The Author 2013.

Whilst the community has grown since the first edition of the International Seville Conference on Future-oriented Technology Analysis (FTA), there is still little dialogue and exchange between those applying quantitative and those applying qualitative methods. The FTA events have, since the beginning, provided an avenue to debate methodological aspects and this paper summarises and furthers the discussion developed during the 2011 edition, building on the debates at the conference and between members of the conference Scientific Committee, to which the authors of this paper belong. In particular this paper describes the methodological state of the field through a tripartite taxonomy of increasing levels of qualitative and quantitative integration. It shows how significant progress has been made for simpler forms of combinations but not for more sophisticated (and perhaps more promising) ones. Following that, it suggests that an epistemological divide, common to the social sciences as a whole, combined with cultural differences and misconceptions within the FTA community are amongst the factors undermining further methodological integration.

Considering the potential roles of FTA in enabling a better understanding of complex situations and in defining effective policy responses leads to the understanding that appropriate FTA practices are needed to enable FTA to fulfil such roles. Dealing with disruptive changes - and grand challenges in particular -, therefore, raises several conceptual, methodological and operational issues. Two of them are general, while further two are specific to the so-called grand challenges: i) distinguish known unknowns, unknown knows and unknown unknowns, ii) combine quantitative and qualitative approaches in a relevant and feasible way, iii) understand the complex and systemic nature of grand challenges, and iv) orchestrate joint responses to grand challenges. After a brief explanation of these issues, the paper outlines the main ideas of the papers published in this special issue.

Survey data were collected from 500 managers of retail chains and their suppliers in five Russian cities. The sample includes firms of different sizes that sell food and home electronic appliances. After the diffusion of new contract arrangements is examined, logistic regression models are constructed to evaluate major sources of relational conflicts. The findings indicate that power-advantaged firms disseminate new rules of exchange effectively. However, relational conflicts largely originate not from these new demands but from the frequent contract infringements by both exchange parties. The study is confined to two sectors of retail trade in one country. Further research is required to determine the effects on channel relationships of the financial crisis and of the adoption of restrictive federal legislation. Practitioners should recognise the need to provide socio-political legitimacy for the new rules of exchange. Otherwise, they may face relational conflicts and provoke restrictive state regulations. Public officials should know that relational conflicts may originate largely from opportunistic behaviour by exchange parties rather than from abuse of market power.

Ideal-typical trials are called explanatory trials to distinguish it from trials completed under real-world conditions. The four most prevalent types of bias (selection-, performance-, attrition-, and detection-bias) can be avoided and internal validity of a study can be increased if all requested quality criteria will be met. The external validity can be neither investigated not can it be confirmed by randomized trials. But the confirmation of external validity is as important as the confirmation of internal validity because knowledge that has been generated in RCTs will be valuable only if it can be successfully applied to patients under real-world conditions. For confirmation of external validity the mentioned four types of bias have to be avoided. In addition, it has to be confirmed that the individuals from whom the evidence was derived are comparable to the individuals to whom the evidence should be applied. Violation of this simple appearing requirement is called 'sampling bias'. A two-step procedure seems to be useful to confirm internal as well as external evidence. As first step the efficacy of a therapeutic principle may be confirmed under ideal study conditions by using an explanatory trial without demanding the confirmation of external validity. In a second step the benefit for the investigated group of patients is examined under real-world conditions (pragmatic trial). The design and established methods for evaluation of these studies are discussed. The two-step approach offers three advantages: it reduces the risk to over-interpret the results of RCTs as explanatory trials can only demonstrate efficacy under ideal conditions. The benefit which is requested by our authorities can be demonstrated only by pragmatic trials which consider the external validity. Progress may possibly achieved only if controlled pragmatic trials will be used which can compare the influence of the intended (specific treatment effect) intervention with not-intended (confounder) interventions.

Through a careful analysis of classic interpretations of Hobbes by Tönnies and Parsons, coupled with a close reading of Hobbes' actual texts, and his criticisms of Aristotle, this paper will suggest that a different understanding of the 'people' who populate Hobbes' social universe is possible.

Within this study fellow students with whom a certain student spends most of his or her time were considered to be his or her friends. An assistant at university is a fellow student whom students ask for help in their studies most of all. Data on a structure of relationships in student groups were collected by means of a questionnaire. In order to analyze a distinction between friendship networks and assistance networks at university, an exponential random graph modeling (ERGM) method was used. The authors show that both networks are characterized by reciprocity of relationships and that in both networks relationships have a tendency to form triads. Probability of a relationship between students depends to a great extent on their belonging to one training group and one sex. Students ask for help and are on friendly terms with those fellow students who have academic achievements of the same level as they do. Academically successful students are popular in the assistance network but not in the friendship network. The received results are analyzed in terms of their meaning for co-education effects. Characteristics of reciprocity of relationships, as well as of their isolation in triads, are important for interpreting the ways the co-education effects can distribute. It looks like the greatest influence on a certain student's achievements his reciprocal friends and assistants can have, and also his immediate environment density. Students studying on a commercial basis are more likely to form friendship networks, while students studying in state-funded places are more likely to form assistance networks. Students of different modes of study seem to build their social relationships in different ways, and so influence of peers on students of different modes of study is different. The authors arrive at a conclusion that in the analysis of co-education effects it is necessary to take into consideration a role different relationships play in distributing these effects, as well as internal features of networks according to which social relationships are built, and also mechanisms of gaining popularity and influence among students.","Assistance networks; Co-education; Friendship networks; Popularity; Social influence; Social networks; Students",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027567919

The fundamental hypothesis was that the academic progress of a pupil contributes to his or her popularity in classes with high motivation, where most children are well disposed towards education, and results in waning popularity in classes with low motivation. The second hypothesis was that the connection between popularity and academic progress was stronger for girls than for boys. The sociometric popularity is determined by a number of friendly nominations received by a pupil from his or her classmates. The academic context of a class is defined as an aggregated characteristic of all pupils' individual academic motivation. To measure individual motivation, the Study involvement scale comprised of 10 questions was used. The academic progress was measured by means of an average score of final marks for a previous term in 5 subjects: Russian language, Algebra, A foreign language, Biology, Physics. In the study 5904 pupils (309 classes, 101 schools of Saint-Petersburg) of the 8-10th grades (14-16 years of age) took part. Data were analyzed by means of a multilevel regression analysis (HLM7). Reliability of the received results was confirmed by a special dyad analysis for network data (p2). The received results prove a gender specificity of popularity factors. Good progress is more important for girls' popularity than for boys' popularity. Girls' popularity is positively associated with an average score, regardless of a class context. A connection between boys' marks and their popularity depends on the context: in classes with high academic motivation this association is positive, in classes with low motivation it is negative. The study revealed threshold effects: the context influence becomes apparent only if a class motivation level achieves extreme values. In classes with extremely low academic motivation boys who study well face danger of marginalization. The authors offer to use data concerning popularity of different categories of pupils when evaluating an educational setting quality, in particular to determine problem classes.","Academic progress; School children; School setting; Social network analysis; Social status; Sociometric popularity",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027554279

Document management is regarded as an administrative practice allowing the Ministry to inculcate bureaucratic values and an ethos of serving the government in professor, making them renounce their administrative autonomy. Being engaged in bureaucratic re-arrangement of reality, Russian professors very soon embarked on paperwork, which boosted the document flow in universities. The large scale of this behavior model indicates that a new type of university culture was born. Bureaucratic management of universities in the Russian Empire was different from that in Western countries in that it aimed to make the document flow uniform with other public institutions and to develop uniform rules and formal language. As a result, professors gradually lost the opportunity to express their own opinions and to take initiative in communicating with the government. The authors emphasize the subordinate nature of activities performed by professors to satisfy relevant governmental demands, which suggested that professors assisted in opening new schools, controlled existing ones, eradicated prejudice, obtained primary data on imperial regions and resources (topographic, meteorological, ethnographic, and economic data), and disseminated Western scientific ideas and knowledge in regional culture.

The reviewer determines and comments on the key issues covered in the book, such as: choosing a language of education, teaching languages in school, discursive practices widely used in schools, role of language socialization and language stereotypes in academic achievements of students. Bringing these subject matters together is explained by a strong intention to involve sociolinguistic methods and theories as much as possible into understanding school language processes. Attention is drawn to the fact that the book is a crossroads of some major subject matters that have been isolated from each other in sociolinguistics and have been studied by isolated teams of researchers who almost never appealed to each other in their studies. Thus, a comprehensive sociolinguistic view of the school is provided. An analysis is made of how the authors of the book develop a problem field dubbed as ""school sociolinguistics"". Research in this area has great prospects, as collected comparison materials and analytical findings demonstrate how many school education issues should be seen through the language glass and how little attention is paid to them in Russian educational surveys. In each chapter, the book provides an overview of general conceptual framework, known results, and numerous examples of language situations in different societies. Survey results are never transferred from one culture to another in this book. Maslinsky finds it appropriate and reasonable to apply sociolinguistic tools developed in Western studies to school education and to the modern Russian school.","Language attitudes; Language in school; Language policy; Language socialization; School sociolinguistics; Teaching a foreign language",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027464347

In the first part of the article basic definitions are given, and key statistical characteristics of social media are described - such as network density, a network degree, the degree distribution, a walk, a distance, a diameter, a clustering coefficient, centrality. Then two approaches to social media modelling are described and examples of some particular models are given. Models where a network is considered to be a multidimensional dependent variable (random graph exponential models, stochastic actor-oriented models and so on) explain the associations by agents' characteristics and network statistics. Models where networks are independent variables (for example, spatial regression models) explain results of an actor's activity by network properties, results and characteristics of other actors. In the second part of the article a review of empirical studies of students' social media is given. One of key factors that determine initiation of friendly ties between students is proximity of their characteristics. Students strive for interacting with peers who are somehow like themselves: of one ethnic group, with similar social and economic characteristics and interests. A geographic proximity of students' places of residence, their neighbourhood in a hostel also enhance the likelihood of initiation of friendly ties. Another line of research is connected to the analysis of how students' social media influence their academic progress and behaviour in an academic setting. Empirical studies show that a student setting with a high training level - friends, neighbours in the hostel, fellow students - contribute to a better average score of the student. Influence of other students' characteristics, behaviour and academic progress on academic progress of the student is referred to as a co-education effect or a setting effect. There are empirical confirmations that the co-education effect has a stronger influence on students' education process than a social integration, personal achievements or a personal motivation. The student setting influences not only the academic progress but also what courses are selected to study, sports achievements and a general feeling of life satisfaction. Although students' social media are predominantly formed under the influence of endogenous factors, an appropriate university policy can to some extent contribute to development of friendships between students, and their significance is determined by an influence of co-education effects on students' academic progress.","Academic achievements; Co-education effects; Higher education; Social media",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027459000

Polivanova investigates into the notion of ""identity"" that Gee considers the original home of any human action, where newcomers realize their belonging to a social group and accept its appreciative systems. She discusses the problem of student identity in learning and the risks of buying into the identity of being a ""good student"", instead of buying into disciplines. The identity of following the learning rules distorts motivation for cognitive activities, creating an attitude of learning to avoid sanctions instead of learning for knowledge. Gee's idea of self-assessment as an ultimate point of learning is analyzed in the context of the Russian theory of action. Polivanova points to the break-through nature of seeing self-assessment as a means of maintaining identity. The commentary examines importance of the game in educational practices and relationship between knowledge and competencies. Gee's attitude towards formal assessment is presented. Polivanova also describes Gee's types of learning in the 19th century, which get more and more promising as new opportunities for modeling learning environments appear.","Activity theory; Assessment; Interiorization; Learning; Play; Self-appraisal; Social groups",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027458102

She claims that indifferent, or shallow, reading and writing in university trace their roots back to school or even pre-school years. Akhapkina determines stages of language personality development, studies the factors that influence the development of reading competencies at each of these stages, and reveals the major killers of interest in reading. Proper development of comprehensive reading skills may be achieved, first of all, by balancing belles-lettres with scientific and educational texts, and balancing duration and frequency of active reading with those of passive listening and watching. The author discusses how comprehensive reading motivation and level of understanding depend on the text selected and on whether it is self-sufficient or not. Markers of an academic text are identified, as they are seen by high school and university students. The most important ones are redundant terminology, complex syntax overload, and conformance to the methodical model.

Dismissal of students from Russian higher education institutions has been studied through analyzing the results of questionnaires and interviews conducted among dismissed students. It has been established that Russian higher education system fosters a special type of academic dismissal, which is a coercive procedure performed by universities, or professors, towards students. Academic dismissal in Russia has a qualitative distinction from the dropout phenomenon characteristic of the Western world, when a student leaves a university voluntarily. Most commonly, students drop out because they are poorly integrated into university life; thus, dropouts may be prevented by implementing socialization and orientation programs. Specific features of academic dismissal in Russia require introduction of special dismissal level control principles. It has been discovered that dismissed students are very likely to resume their education (only 4% of respondents give up on higher education), which reveals the need to improve criteria of academic assessment and to develop non-dismissal institutional discipline measures. Exploration of academic dismissal reasons and mechanisms is of practical importance for enhancing efficiency of educational policies in higher education institutions.","Academic culture; Academic dismissal; Education financing; Higher education; Learning efficiency; Student dropout",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027452762

Cross tabulation and correlation analysis of questionnaire data have revealed a positive though insignificant interdependence between parental education and high-school students' educational trajectories and academic achievements. Gender and ethnic group have proven to be the best predictors of academic progress; in particular, female students have better performance than males and Tatar-speaking students outperform Russian speakers. Educational trajectories depend mostly on gender (20% more female students plan to get higher education). Regression and discriminant analyses have shown that, to predict academic progress, one should take into account education of parents (mostly fathers) and other independent variables: cultural capital, non-cognitive skills, peers' attitude towards education, health, ethnicity and gender. Higher education prospects are determined by education of parents (mostly fathers). However, performance and gender variables also contribute to the statistics (high performance gives more chances for higher education; female students are more likely to get higher education than male students).

It has been established that first-year students are primarily differentiated by their family status and by the reasons for choosing their field of study. These factors are responsible for different attitudes towards education and belonging to the university in the first year of studies. Academic performance at school plays a less important role in differentiating between the student groups.

The notion of «real structure» integrates formalized and non-formalized professional relationships in an educational institution. Statement of this problem is connected to the pressing topic of the teacher's professional loneliness, that is to a low level of institutions' social capital. The professional loneliness of teachers results in the situation when the most urgent task of educators' professional development, of human capital formation is mostly fulfilled at the expense of external resources (training in external organizations). But there are problems here in terms of both financial restrictions and poor professional development system performance. Internal resources of the educational institution (observation of other professional practices, reflection, peer tuition) are hard to access because of a low level of social capital and often do not constitute the focus of attention for heads of schools. The author considers not only reasons for the institutions' real structure study, but also a toolkit which enables to appraise workplace stable relationships in the institution, their configurations and other characteristics of network structures. The study uses both traditional socio-demographic characteristics and network analysis elements. The author makes the assumption that the institution's real structure is simple (has a low level of complexity), considers it to be a social network and thinks that this simplicity can be a critical deterrent to development of a certain institution. Then complication of real structures is an important resource in terms of improving effectiveness of training and education and contributes to growth of social and consequently human capital at school. A pilot phase, carried out on the basis of five Russian schools in different regions, revealed that real interaction structures are indeed characterized by a low level of complexity, one-way relationships are prevalent in school communities, a percentage of reciprocal relationships is insignificant, a dyad constitutes a typical configuration of reciprocal relationships, a number of triads is greatly limited. During 2013-2014 the author expects to involve a considerable number of general education institutions which will make it possible to identify common problems of real structures in the secondary level education system on the whole.","Human capital; Professional capital; Professional development; Professional loneliness; Social capital; Social networks; Teachers; Workplace relationships",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014140959

The research design consisted of two repeated measures of high school students: the first observation was done when respondents were 9th grade students (n = 2000), the second one was carried out two years later on the same sample (n = 1 1 56 due to sample attrition). After graduating from 9th grade survey participants were obliged to make a career choice, they could stay in a higher school for another two years, move to an elementary professional school (2-year education) or continue in a vocational secondary school (3-year education). Path analysis was conducted using Mplus Version 6 software. Results showed that family educational resources and students' expectations are positively related with all three mediators. It was revealed that there is no direct effect of family educational resources on young men educational choices. Family resources influence on adolescents' career are fully mediated by students' educational achievements and expectations. In other words self-efficacy and educational expectations can considerably change family resources effect. Grit as a personal trait did not show mediating effect.

The author considers reforms of teacher training systems in 12 countries of Asia, Europe and North America which were carried out during last decades of the XXth century: grounds for these reforms, main trends of changes that took place, their nodal elements which in the author's opinion need to be taken into account when planning a teacher training reform in Russia. All actions of reformers come to three main directions: a system of measures aimed at increasing teachers' occupational prestige, a package of measures aimed at retention of teachers in schools and transition to such a design of teacher training educational programmes that would help with performing the first two tasks. The reforms resulted in the following changes: the teacher training system ceased to be departmental, and a base unit (a design unit) is now an educational programme ready for continuous variation, and not a structure which fulfills it. The author discusses such indicators of occupational prestige as teacher wage rates in different countries and a training level of applicants at teacher training higher education institutions. There are systems of measures in many countries which have a good track record and make the occupation look attractive for youth: monthly allowances for pupils in the final year of secondary school under the condition that after graduating from a higher education institution they will work not less than three years at school; a special enrollment procedure for those who apply for teacher educational programmes which includes, along with a centralized testing, interviews - in order to appraise acceptability for the teaching profession - creativity competitions, recommendations are requested; possibility to get a teacher education in dif ferent ways; provision of career oppor tunities. The ar ticle shows that there are no institutional arr angements in Russia which would ensure youth retention in the occupation. All changes, including positive ones (formation of a training system for new experts in terms of the Russian school - psychologists, tutors, consultants), are extraordinarily difficult to formalize as legislative acts. And if it still happens, then a new standard is given as a rule according to the old logic which rigidly determines a type of a performer's activity. Under such conditions rise of any institutions which would encourage initiatives, reflection concerning results of an innovative search, would induce transformation of the existing structures is just impossible.","Career opportunities; Educational programmes; Occupational prestige; School teachers; Teacher training models; Teacher training system reforms",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006683504

There is an extensive literature review in the article where the authors analyze in detail foreign and national hands-on experiences of account taken of territory factors in educational inequality studies. In Russia the basic problem that didn't let to work out an accurate and differential estimate of territory development at the level of municipal units until quite recently was an absence of the corresponding statistics. In 2011 the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) for the first time opened access to a database with information from municipal units' statistical passports. The authors analyze how differences in educational results between Russian schools are connected to their differences in 1) social and economic characteristics of pupils and their families; 2) physical and human resources; 3) certain territory development indicators depending on where the schools are situated. The authors used data from social passports collected during surveys in schools of the Moscow and the Yaroslav regions in 2011-2012, as well as municipal statistics data which enable to estimate a level of social and economic deprivation in settlements of different types on the basis of a limited set of indicators. In the statistical analysis a two-level regression model was used. A multilevel analysis enables first of all to find out how variables measured at the level of both schools and settlements are connected to an average mark for Unified state exam; in the second place it enables to check if a nature of connection between variables measured at the level of schools and the average mark for USE depends on characteristics of the settlements (by means of interaction effects); and in the third place it enables to estimate to what extent a connection between characteristics of schools and the average mark for USE in different settlements is different (by means of the so-called random effects). The analysis results make it possible to state that the academic progress determined on the basis of aver-age marks for Russian language and Mathematics USE is indeed consistently different in schools with 1) different social structure and 2) different physical and human resources. A level of territory deprivation in itself does not influence educational results: typically poor training outcomes that are observed for example in country schools can be explained by resource scarcity and their specific social structure characteristics.","Education quality assessment; Educational results; Schools; Socioeconomic deprivation; Socioeconomic status of family; Unified State Exam",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006672434

Although privately recognizing social problems concerning the neighbourhood and its residents, who live in marginal social conditions, local authorities are silent vis-à-vis these issues. Drawing on long-term fieldwork and analysis of local media and policy texts, I show that in the absence of local authorities’ official discourses on Roma and the neighbourhood, social order is continually maintained through an unofficial complex dynamic, which I call ‘urban governance apparatus’. I show that this ‘apparatus’ is composed of three elements, namely (1) public policy in the neighbourhood; (2) urban Roma stigma; and (3) what I call ‘surreptitious gazing’ in the neighbourhood.

An enduring advantage of large over small sets (i.e., negative slopes of search functions) was found, and this advantage grew with the number of colored subsets among distractors. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the negative slopes cannot be ascribed to the spatial grouping between distractors but can be partially explained by the spatial density of the visual sets. Hence, it appears that observers relied on numerosity of subsets to guide attention. Experiments 3a and 3b tested the processes within and between color subsets of distractors more precisely. It was found that the visual system collects numerosity statistics that can be used for guidance within each subset independently. However, each subset representation should be serially selected by attention. As attention shifts from one subset to another, the ""statistical power"" effects from every single subset are accumulated to provide a more pronounced negative slope.","attention; ensemble representation; feature search; numerosity; visual search","attention; color vision; female; human; male; pattern recognition; physiology; reaction time; statistical distribution; Attention; Color Perception; Female; Humans; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reaction Time; Statistical Distributions","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961203995

The paper studies how informal education system is related with everyday activists' practices and identifies structural organization of this system and its consistency with political and philosophical attitudes in the community. It has been discovered that, despite severe criticism of formal education system, education remains highly appreciated by anarchists. Thus, they mostly trust informal education channels, as independent sources of information. Social space of informal education is represented by communication, i.e. adherents translate key anarchist values through everyday interpersonal communication and demonstrate their belonging to the community through reference to important texts, names, and events. An informal education system in a subcultural environment is formed the same way as formal systems are formed: knowledge is selected, legitimized, optimized, and reproduced in compliance with ideological principles. Ideology is transparent in informal education, unlike in formal one. Subject areas of anarchist informal education are integrated in activist and political projects and related to anarchist philosophy and everyday life. As individuals are involved into informal education practices based on alternative interpretation of existing economic, governmental, and social structures, it results in changing their vision of the world and reorganizing their essential strategies and everyday practices. The analysis has demonstrated how informal knowledge systems can replace formal ones and produce new forms of sociality, changing not only parlance but also lifestyle, activities, and consumer practices of adherents.","Anarchists; Critical pedagogy; Informal education; Libertarian pedagogy; Lifelong learning; Self-education; Spontaneous education; Youth communities; Youth movements; Youth subcultures",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84956992706

This paper analyses the efficiency of international labs in achieving these goals in terms of criteria that are intrinsic (number of publications, patents etc.) and perceived (job satisfaction). Motivation and involvement of employees as well as availability of resources are regarded as the main determinants of efficiency. Based on previous international and domestic studies in the field we build a conceptual model to estimate causal relations and correlations between these five variables. Our data source was the online survey of international scientific laboratories staff, which was conducted in April-June, 2012. The paper first describes the sample characteristics, then carries out factor analysis of motivation resulting in a typology, and, finally, presents a structural equation modeling to test the conceptual framework of analysis. Factor analysis reveals that four important groups of employee motives exist. Laboratory staff may be motivated (or unmotivated) by achievement in science, focus on careers abroad, practical-oriented material values and satisfaction with working conditions. Using structural equation modeling authors provide empirical evidence for the hypothesis about relations between employee engagement and job satisfaction. The more employees are engaged in lab activities, the higher are job satisfaction and productivity level. However, the strength of these effects is relatively small. The assumption of a positive relationship between job satisfaction and available resources was also confirmed. Additionally, analysis showed that employee engagement has a positive effect on the achievement of both objective and subjective results.","International research centers; Job satisfaction; Motivation; Research efficiency; Researchers; Resources; Results",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902484235

Policy-makers and experts are challenged to elucidate its distinct paths in different economies, to show why some countries succeed and others fail on their way towards modernization, and to identify the factors that make success stories. In this case, close attention is paid to the linkages between modernization and value systems, in particular, to tolerance. The aim of this paper is to test empirically the assumption that tolerance exerts a significant positive influence on modernization (which is understood in its 'narrow' sense as economic and technological development) as well as the contribution of an enabling mechanism - political institutions. The theoretical frameworks of our study are the cultural modernization approach by Ronald Inglehart and the concept of the ""creative class"" by Richard Florida. We used data from 58 countries over 1996-2008, retrieved from the World Values Survey, as well as from the World Bank databases ""World Development Indicators"" and ""Worldwide Governance Indicators"". The analysis confirmed that tolerance does have a significant impact on modernization in terms of transition towards a post-industrial (innovation) economy. This process is associated with the emergence of a specific social class - a creative class. Tolerance, expressed as a tolerant attitude towards homosexuality, gender equality, and a decrease in xenophobia, is a crucial prerequisite in establishing and maintaining favorable conditions for attracting creative people. Two distinct patterns of modernization are revealed, depending on the level of social tolerance: a tolerant model and a catch-up model. The post-industrial economy requires the formation of a relevant society based on the values of self-expression. However, some countries try to build a post-industrial economy without building a post-industrial society, although the probability of success in this case is rather low. This catch-up model focuses on investment, a lower-level of tolerance, and weak political institutions. The latter matter especially, and they seem to be the causal mechanism to ensure the linkages between tolerance and successful modernization. First of all, the linkage emerges from the rule of law and control of corruption. Institutions are regarded as a key element in the tolerant model of modernization, ensuring creative people to maintain openness, diversity, and protection of their interests, including the right to identity. Catch-up strategy, in contrast, puts the main emphasis not on values and strengthening institutions, but on higher investment rates.","Creative class; Cultural change; Innovation; Institutions; Investment; Modernization; Tolerance",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902441406

It is argued that after World War II, when his contacts with Gumilev took place, Savitskii himself had already abandoned the central ideas of ""classical"" Eurasianism and, thus, strictly speaking ceased to be a Eurasianist. At least since the late 1930s Savitskii's ""classical"" Eurasianist historiosophical and political ideas developed into a new, explicitly anti-Western and pro-Soviet, yet still anticommunist conceptual framework that can be called ""trans-Eurasianism.""

Some destinations boast a specific gastronomic brand, while others do not have a clearly defined 'gastronomic face'. Moreover, some territories lack the 'food basis' or unique gastronomic resources, such as a brand product or local cuisine, for creating such a brand. The authors undertook an investigation of whether a territorial gastronomic brand can be formed when a region lacks a definite 'food basis'. What is the basis for creating a regional gastronomic brand (RGB)? Does the 'food basis' always form the nucleus of a gastronomic brand? Or within the framework of the experience economy, is a 'non-culinary', 'non-food' addition sufficient for creating an RGB? The authors argue that the basis for a gastronomic brand can be traced to the cultural and historic traditions of the region.

We had the intention of showing the role of time in acquiring and mastering social contacts. In our research, we outlined a number of methods to develop time competence, various conscious and unconscious ways to organize time, and to create an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, and trust in the process of interpersonal non-verbal communication. It can be noted that time characteristics of social behavior and its non-verbal manifestation can exert a positive influence on a person's communicative activity, and determine their time competence in communication. Ignoring time parameters of self-realization and self-actualization of personality introduces a certain destructive element in the process of interpersonal relations. Hence, there arises the necessity of teaching communicative competence in communication. Teaching is fulfilled in the process of training and includes several stages: introductory stage, stages of intensification, integration, avoidance, etc. Thus, time management and the process of teaching time management allow revealing time resources of self-organization of personality in their lifetime. © Common Ground, Alla Bolotova, All Rights Reserved.","Interpersonal Relations; Time Aspects; Verbal and Non-verbal Communication",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884747433

Four personality types were differentiated - dependent, steady, unsteady and diffuse. The research allows us to suggest that the hardiness level has become the main factor in the choice of coping strategies.

The details of this government initiative, however, still remain unclear, as do specific implementation arrangements. The paper provides the results of focus groups, held by the Higher School of Economics, in order to identify potential parameters of efficient contract modeling in the R&D sector. The discussions involved representatives from the State Academies of Sciences, universities and government research centers. Among issues raised were the organization of labor and remuneration system in the R&D sector, productivity of scientific activities, institutional conditions for a transition to «efficient contracts», and factors affecting the loyalty of researchers. Major conclusions presented in the paper include recommendations for salaries and for the research remuneration system for R&D personnel. In the authors' view, one of the key parameters of an efficient research contract should be a «fair» minimum salary guaranteed by the government. Another recommendations in reference to R&D evaluation is that efficient contracts should guarantee not only fair rewards but also competitive selection in order to prevent an excessive inflow of the workforce from other sectors of the economy. Finally, the paper discusses problems of funding and the institutional development of the R&D sector. In the authors' view, it will hardly be possible to build a high-performing system of efficient contracts without implementing profound reforms restructuring the R&D sector («selection of the best»), improving the funding system (finding additional sources of investment, streamlining the operation of public science foundations), modernizing the physical infrastructure, and arranging for the conservation of Russian scientific schools and attracting young talent.","Efficient contract; Pay-for-performance; R&D evaluation; Remuneration system; Researcher; S&T policy",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884523039

This paper studies the dynamics of key characteristics of the academic profession in Russia. We use data on Russian university faculty from two large-scale comparative studies of the academic profession (the «International Academic Profession», a study carried out by the Carnegie Center in 1992 in 14 countries, including Russia [Altbach, 1996], and the «Changing Academic Profession», a study implemented in 2007, with 19 participating countries, including Russia, in 2012 [Teichler et al., 2013]) to look at how faculty attitudes on aspects of academic life changed over 20 years (1992-2012): for instance faculty views on reasons for leaving or staying at the university, on university management and on the faculty's role in decision making. We also use the international dataset from the «Changing Academic Profession» to compare Russian faculty to those in other countries. The article provides an analysis of teaching/research preferences, views on the personal strain associated with work, and academic career perspectives for Russian universities (1992 and 2012) in comparison with those of other countries. One of the main conclusions is that the high degree of overall centralization of governance in Russian universities has barely changed in 20 years. This undermines talk of universities' shift towards academic self-governance. The basic attitudes of university faculties are in many ways the same over twenty years, although perception of the mission of higher education has changed. Previously the mission was to prepare students for a successful professional career, now the priority is seen in strengthening the country's position at the international level. One can hardly argue, however, that universities are in a position to implement this new mission.","Academic contracts; Academic profession; Higher education; Research and teaching nexus; Research universities; University governance",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884514202

We present an overview of best practices for HEIs, some typologies, a set of indicators and mathematical tools for constructing a typology of Russian public HEIs. This typology is based on clustering the input (resource allocation) and output (performance) indicators that characterize academic and educational achievements of HEIs. The proposed classification differentiates types of universities and contains a decision tree that allows assigning universities to one category or another.

S. Vygotsky and his adherents. The authors put forward and empirically tested two hypotheses for the academic content acquisition process that followed from this theory. The first one concerns an underlying logic of this process, that is an indispensable sequence of its stages and results description of which forms a taxonomy of educational objectives. The study tests the taxonomy that is based on a symbol acquisition level scheme outlined by L. S. Vygotsky and specified by V. V. Davydov and his colleagues in their works. The second hypothesis concerns a temporal property of the acquisition defined by two theoretical constructs: the notion of a zone of proximal development (L. S. Vygotsky), according to which real academic content acquisition extends beyond the training process time frame, and cultural development periodization (D. B. Elkonin) which describes how the training is included into the maturation process. The study used a set of level school tests developed by a group of Russian experts who were guided by the cultural development theory - Student Achievement Monitoring (SAM). Pupils of different ages from different regions of Russia were tested for acquisition of the Elementary School Mathematics and Russian language program. The first hypothesis was tested as part of a paper test appraisal in some regions of the Russian Federation in spring of 2012. More than 5000 fourth-grade pupils of comprehensive schools took part in the appraisal process. The second hypothesis was tested as part of a special study comprised of two stages. At the first stage SAM tests of Mathematics and Russian language were given to the 4th, 6th, 8th and 10th grade pupils. At the second stage, in a year, the same pupils took the same tests, and repeated cross sections were formed. The study results on the whole support the offered level scheme: as regards most units of tasks that are formed according to criteria specified in the taxonomy, the tasks of the first, second and third levels create a corresponding hierarchy in terms of complexity. And what is more, in most cases the complexity increase from the first level to the second and to the third levels is clearly statistically significant. The received results also validate the hypothesis that the acquisition process is considerably outside the scope of training in itself: full acquisition of the elementary school academic content takes place approximately by the end of the middle school.","Acquisition level; Orientation; Symbol; Training; Zone of proximal development",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027568427

Due to unverified validity and high financial cost, it is not recommended to adopt wide use of alternative pedagogical education programs and the Added Value Model in assessing performance of faculties of education based on achievements of students taught by graduates. Emphasis is placed on the positive experience of the American professional accreditation system, the two-level teaching certification, elements of the Clinical Model of teacher education designed to develop partner relationship between universities and schools and involving intensive teaching practices, and active teacher internship in schools allowing to increase significantly the quality of education and to reduce staff turnover rate. The author sees the most appropriate form of accreditation for Russian teaching programs in enhancing the existing uniform accreditation system while applying specific standards and requirements to fields of study in education. Practical tips are given to transform the existing standards. The author discusses feasibility of integrating pedagogical HE institutions with universities and alternative ways to develop the former. He explores opportunities for attracting talented candidates to pedagogical institutions and advantages that the double degree educational system provides for training experts of better qualification using Master's degree programs.","Accreditation; Educational standards; Master's programs; Online education; Teacher training; Teaching quality assessment",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027441070

Second, we construct a simple theoretical model where economic growth is exogenously determined and depends primarily on export externalities. The paper shows that export externalities have a positive and significant impact on employment growth in most sectors of the economy. Simultaneously, spatially lagged export productivity has varying effects on employment growth depending on the sector, which is decelerating economic growth in industrial sectors and accelerating economic development in the most advanced service sectors.

Solar radiation pressure accelerates a spacecraft without any fuel costs and can thus be used to substitute for traditional jets to accomplish many space missions. If the surface has variable reflective characteristics, for instance, using electric current, then solar pressure control can generate rotational torques for attitude control. Consider a solar sail with six spheres attached by mutually orthogonal long rods. Each sphere's entire surface is divided into pixels and each pixel can be specified in an active or non-active mode. Active pixels reflect most of the radiation while non-active pixels absorb it. Consequently, the radiation pressure force on each pixel in different modes is different. In this work, it is shown that after determining the necessary dimensions of the solar sail's structure, pixel reflectance control allows rotation of the entire structure with known moments of inertia around any axis with a predefined accuracy. The spacecraft is assumed to be in an Earth orbit, so gravity gradient torque is considered as another major impact that depends on the orbital altitude. A special program written in C++ was developed that establishes the required parameters of this solar sail and executes an algorithm of rotation around an arbitrary axis with predefined orientation. In each time point, it calculates the appropriate pixel configuration, defines attitude, rotation moments, angular velocities and simulates the full structure's rotation. After program testing, analytical results were obtained, including estimation of rotation torques and angular velocity that depend on the space vehicle's geometry and mass parameters, optical coefficients of the material and the pixel size. These parameters can be used to determine the feasibility of executing the rotation maneuver with such a solar sail in a real space mission. The evaluation the length of rods and the radius of the spheres for the maneuver provides a chance for engineering accomplishment.

The limiting current of the quasineutral ion beam with the total current of the order of one ampere and a small amount of kinetic energy (100 ÷300 eV) in laboratory conditions, namely in the drift tube filled with own gas, is considered. The total time of neutralization of the ion beam in a drift tube and the duration of the process of ion- beam plasma formation are estimated. The problem of electrostatic instability of quasineutral ion beam in a drift tube is considered. The limiting current of electrostatic instability of the quasineutral ion beam represents threshold value of a current above which instability develops without any initial perturbations from infinitely small random fluctuation of potential. In real conditions practically always there are initial perturbations of the ion beam current. For this reason the problem of dynamic decompensation at a finite depth current modulation of the quasineutral ion beam is also considered. Modulation of the ion current leads to a pulsation of the ion beam charge, that, in turn, leads to modulation of ion-beam plasma potential and, hence, of accelerating voltage. It is shown, that the limiting current of electrostatic instability of the quasineutral ion beam in a drift tube is proportional to the concentration of residual gas, to the radius of a drift tube, to the cube of an accelerating voltage and inversely proportional to the potential of ion-beam plasma raised to power of one and a half. It is shown, that the influence of finite modulation of the ion beam current leads to decrease of the instability threshold.Copyright ©2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.",,"Beam plasma interactions; Drift chambers; Hall thrusters; Kinetics; Magnetoplasma; Modulation; Tubes (components); Accelerating voltages; Analysis of stability; Current modulation; Electrostatic instabilities; Initial perturbation; Laboratory conditions; Operating condition; Random fluctuation; Ion beams","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904640162

Jupiter's satellite Europa is close in size to the Moon. Its surface is covered with a layer of ice crust of thickness 10-30 km. Europa's surface is of large interest, because under the ice crust there is an ocean of liquid water creating conditions for possible life. The entire ice surface of the satellite is covered with a system of bands, valleys, and ridges. These structures are explained by the fact, that the ice surface is rather mobile and it was repeatedly broken from internal stresses and large-scale tectonic processes. The analysis performed showed that compressing, extending, shearing and bending stresses can influence some arbitrarily separated section of Europe's ice surface. The computer simulation with a finite element method (FEM) was performed to see, what types of defects could arise from such effects. The heterogeneity of the satellite's ice cover in thickness, density and temperature was taking into account during the simulation. The calculations, carried out for the cross-section of a thawed ice structure's area, have shown that, the most dangerous, from the crack formation viewpoint, is the shear stress at loading application angles of ±90°. Using models of thawed ice patches in the distributed field of temperatures, the effect of mechanical gravitation-tidal forces on the formation of surface defects on Europa was studied. It is shown that fractures and cracks can have various forms depending on the stress-strained state arising in their vicinity. The formation of such defects is caused by the chaotic set of many factors, mechanic and temperature ones predominantly. Copyright © 2013 by the International Astronautical Federation.

A simple method of evaluation of interdependences between integral characteristics of Hall thrusters with anode layer is suggested. The equation of balance of the forces acting on a region with a Hall current and the relation between current of the accelerated ions and the flow rate of working gas are taken into consideration. Given that the geometrical parameters of the specific Hall thruster are fixed this model allows to relate to each other the basic integral characteristics of the thruster, such as accelerating voltage, magnetic field strength, the flow rate of working gas and the current of the accelerated ions. The numerical estimations are presented for one of the most commonly used Hall thrusters with anode layer - TAL-WSF. The region of discharge existence in the channel of the Hall thruster is considered. It is shown, that a rather small demagnetization is typical for Hall thrusters with anode layer, that is the ratio of the strength of magnetic field near anode boundary of Hall current layer to the strength of magnetic field on its cathode boundary is close to 1. It is shown, that taking into account the kinetic effects at free- molecule flow of neutral particles (a preferential depletion of tangentially flying particles and slowly flying particles) leads to decrease of a current of the accelerated ions and thrust of the thruster. The initial heating of working gas also leads to decrease of thrust. The suggested method can be used in engineering of new Hall thrusters for estimation of their parameters. Application of suggested method to stationary plasma thrusters also gives acceptable results.

However, this criterion is hardly ever used to evaluate some investment instruments (e.g. short sales, options, futures, swaps) on the stock market. This is partially due to the fact that such instruments generate non-conventional cash flows, and, consequently, the IRR may be irrelevant or impossible to determine. The IRR may also be impossible to calculate in case of portfolios with withdrawals and contributions during the period evaluated, for which reason it is not always applied. This paper suggests the generalized average rate of return (GARR) without the disadvantages inherent to the IRR. This criterion also allows the authors to make the return concept more specific and internally consistent and reinforce the risk/return principle by using relevant methods for evaluation of investment instruments with non-conventional cash flows.","Capital budgeting; Investment instruments; Multiple internal rates of return; Non-conventional cash flows","Budget control; Earnings; Exhibitions; Investments; Average rate; Capital budgeting; Cash flow; Internal rate of return; Multiple internal rates of return; Stock market; Instruments","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900298127

Since the canonical model of a subject area serves a technical important task and is not intended for human use, it may be generated automatically instead of manually and designed 'from scratch', as a 'union' of models used in the various application parts of the system. Subject area models of the application parts being integrated may be written using different formalisms, and yet another formalism may be used for the canonical model, so that a mechanism is required to automatically capture various concepts expressed in various formal systems.

The reason is that tournaments allow the principal to trade insurance for lower income to the agents. Our analysis shows that this celebrated result does not carry over to the case when a limited liability (bankruptcy) constraint limits the payments the principal can make, provided that the liquidation value of the firm is sufficiently small. This finding has important implications for the vast number of limited liability firms. Even though limited liability becomes an issue for different ranges of liquidation values under the two schemes, tournaments are still superior when the liquidation value of the firm is intermediate or large, even though the limited liability constraint is still binding for intermediate values. Surprisingly, uncertainty in the price of output strengthens the need for tournaments by expanding the range of liquidation values over which tournaments are dominant, because price uncertainty introduces additional bankruptcy risk.

Our enhancements include: applying ILS heuristic by Andrade, Resende and Werneck (in Heuristics 18:525-547, 2012) to find a high-quality initial solution, fast detection of clique vertices in a set of candidates, better initial coloring, and avoiding dynamic memory allocation. A good initial solution considerably reduces the search tree size due to early pruning of branches related to small cliques. Fast detecting of clique vertices is based on coloring. Whenever a set of candidates contains a vertex adjacent to all candidates, we detect it immediately by its color and add it to the current clique avoiding unnecessary branching. Though dynamic memory allocation allows to minimize memory consumption of the program, it increases the total running time. Our computational experiments show that for dense graphs with a moderate number of vertices (like the majority of DIMACS graphs) it is more efficient to store vertices of a set of candidates and their colors on stack rather than in dynamic memory on all levels of recursion.

The excellence ""accelerators"" are specified. The paper studies various options of excellence initiative development and implementation, pointing to pros and cons of each of them. Using international experience and assessing the recent reforms in Russian tertiary education, the authors come to the conclusion that projects designed to make Russian universities more competitive should have the following objectives: active development of multidisciplinary centers of excellence and postgraduate programs in major universities; targeted funding to support promising young researchers; internationalization of education; reformation of the management system. The essential prerequisites for excellence initiatives should be consistent funding and an infrastructure comparable to that of globally competitive universities. It is emphasized that excellence initiatives designed to support research universities still leave open the need for systemic reforms in education, which are supposed to enhance the effects of excellence initiatives.","Excellence initiatives; Federal universities; Financing of education; International rankings; National research universities; Reforming university system",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892517227

We assume that the COP has an additive (separable) objective function and the structure of a feasible (optimal) solution to the COP is predefined by a collection of cells (positions) in an input file. We define a pattern as a collection of positions in an instance problem represented by its input file (matrix). We illustrate the notion of pattern by means of some well-known problems in COP, among them are the linear ordering problem (LOP) and cell formation problem (CFP), just to mention a couple. The CFP is defined on a Boolean input matrix, the rows of which represent machines and columns - parts. The CFP consists in finding three optimal objects: a block-diagonal collection of rectangles, a row (machines) permutation, and a column (parts) permutation such that the grouping efficacy is maximized. The suggested heuristic combines two procedures: the pattern-based procedure to build an initial solution and an improvement procedure to obtain a final solution with high grouping efficacy for the CFP. Our computational experiments with the most popular set of 35 benchmark instances show that our heuristic outperforms all well-known heuristics and returns either the best known or improved solutions to the CFP. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.","Cell formation problem; Group technology; Heuristic","Benchmarking; Cellular manufacturing; Optimization; Cell formation problem; Combinatorial optimization problems; Computational experiment; Design heuristics; Heuristic; Linear assignment; Linear ordering problems; Objective functions; Group technology","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883403792

This increase is so large that even after accounting for the possible execution of PMGs, firms' profits are larger in an equilibrium where PMGs are offered than in an equilibrium without PMGs.

Instead of promoting an active and strong international actor, we face the apparent decline of an international security actor in the making The thesis of this research is that there are two groups of negative variables: the lack of resources and the confusion concerning a vision about the exact position for the EU in the international arena. This paper will focus on the lack of institutional, economic, political and strategic resources. The framework for our analysis is the international paradigm change and the upheaval in the distribution of global power. The Union finds itself bewildered and unable to take a position on the axis of world power, or stakes in the field of global dominance. Instead, member states show their reluctance to increase resources for the EU-or a disoriented CDSP. Yet, strengthening the CSDP would be a necessary approach for the EU to adapt to the current international environment, utilizing its specific civilian and military capacities to address its myriad security concerns. Evaluating the outcome of the Common Security and Defence Policy today can be discouraging, as the results are not the ones intended by the reforms introduced in the Treaty of Lisbon (Howorth 2007): disappointments span from the Libya crisis to the problems of agreeing on the EDA budget, and from a continuous lack of capabilities to the role played individually by some member states (Lancaster agreement, Franco-German axis, national business with defence industry). In fact, only one new EU operation has been deployed since 2009 (with two ready for launch), compared with twenty-three from 2003 to 2008. In sum, instead of promoting an active and strong international actor, we face the apparent decline of an international security actor in the making. Our analytic approach, more than strictly theoretical, will be political and strategic. As the logical consequence of exogenous forces, most notably the diminishing relative military significance attached by the United States (US) to European security, the CSDP should be promoted as a way for European countries to improve their own security-and then their power, and as a way to adapt to the current international environment, so different from the one existing when the CSDP started. Today it seems clear from the facts described below, as well as the economic weakness of member states, that the defense of Europe needs a European defense, the CSDP (Perruche 2012). If CFSP changes its aims, ambitions and capabilities, it will imply a change in the European Security Strategy too. 4If there is a possibility to escape from the grim situation described, it should start by a clear analysis of the negative variables influencing the EU’s current defense position. A critical assessment of the achievements and the current weaknesses should be the starting point to overcome the paralysis. According to our thesis, we can summarize these negative variables in two groups: the lack of resources, and the confusion concerning the exact position the EU should strive for in international arena.

Modern kids' maturation is mediated to a much lesser extent by clear and well-defined development prospects, by close relations with adults. And by the authors' hypothesis, cultural texts start act as child development mediators. In this regard an issue concerning a developmental potential of these texts is raised. The authors give reasons for necessity of new developmental psychology research in the context of a culture-historical theory that would be based on updated data. Two empirical studies are described. An analysis of a preschoolers' game inspired by plots of modern animated series revealed, in the first place, a possibility in principle to organize games with the developmental potential on the basis of modern animated cartoons, and in the second place, a kids' ability to use for their games plots where relations between characters are complicated and mixed. These data expand the notion of a child's play prototype, and so far it was considered to be a fairytale with well-defined boundaries of good and evil. Modern kids can reproduce while playing more sophisticated and more complicated relations between characters. To find out why books about Harry Potter written by J. Rowling are so popular with adolescents, pupils of the 8th-10th grades were interviewed, as well as participants of Internet forums on Potteriana. Respondents also took some projective tests. It turns out that for adolescents an initiative action, an outstanding, heroic deed with an unknown result has a great appeal. Besides, the adolescents attribute a possibility of such an action to a fantasy, magic world, and as for the physical reality, they qualify it as gray and dull. On the basis of these findings the authors draw a conclusion that modern cultural texts imply a sophisticated spectator and reader, give freedom and openness, offer to take action in a situation of ambiguity and uncertainty; that is to say, they form a non-didactic mode of interaction in principle. Modern cultural texts for kids and adolescents have the developmental potential but are ignored by an educational system.","Action; Age of adolescence; Childhood; Childhood crisis; Culture-historical theory; Fairytale; Maturation; Reading; Role-playing game; Subjectness",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027575264

It is reasoned in the article why a focus on specific labour market segments and a nature of a university basic product are used as grounds for a typology and sorting out of groups of organizations. On the basis of the formulated approach to the typology the Soviet ""master plan"" is reconstructed, since, from the authors' point of view, the present-day Russian higher education system structure is greatly determined by the Soviet experience of its development. The authors show that the Soviet project was based on the idea of an administrative labour market control, as well as on a number of historically developed institutional peculiarities, and on the whole it ran a model of a quasi-corporate higher vocational education system. It is analyzed how the higher education system structure received by Russia from the Soviet Union changed under the influence of external factors for the education system and only in the least thanks to a conscious public policy. On the basis of an analysis of quantitative data a typology of higher education organizations resulted from these changes is described. The authors consider possible structural policy directions in the field of higher vocational education as a foundation for working out a ""master plan"" of restructuring the higher education system in Russia. Goals are set that upgrading of the higher education structure should meet: involving Russia into global knowledge and technology networks; meeting the key industries' demands for personnel and for research work which would help the country to achieve competitiveness; supporting a basic socio-economic structure in a region; meeting an increasing demand of the population for higher education.","Differentiation; Educational reforms; Higher education system; Institutional diversity; Internal higher education institution's diversification; Labour market",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027545514

In the process of updating beliefs, differences in the weighting of private and publicly available social information may modulate the probability that a cascade starts in a decisive way. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined neural activity while participants updated their beliefs based on the decisions of two fictitious stock market traders and their own private information, which led to a final decision of buying one of two stocks. Computational modeling of the behavioral data showed that a majority of participants overweighted private information. Overweighting was negatively correlated with the probability of starting an informational cascade in trials especially prone to conformity. Belief updating by private information was related to activity in the inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex; the more a participant overweighted private information, the higher the activity in the inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula and the lower in the parietal-temporal cortex. This study explores the neural correlates of overweighting of private information, which underlies the tendency to start an informational cascade. © The Author (2014).","Belief updating; FMRI; Informational cascades; Insular cortex; Parietal cortex; Social influence","adult; algorithm; brain; brain cortex; brain mapping; computer simulation; cultural anthropology; decision making; female; frontal lobe; human; individuality; male; mental function; nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; psychological model; social environment; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Computer Simulation; Culture; Decision Making; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Individuality; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Processes; Models, Psychological; Neural Pathways; Social Environment; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926509433

Instead of raising fertility, completed cohort fertility declined from 1.8 births per woman for the 1960 birth cohort to 1.6 for the 1968 cohort. The government of President Putin became concerned with the dire demographic conditions of high mortality and low fertility in Russia in the 1990s and early 2000s. A comprehensive set of pronatalist measures came into effect in January 2007. The period total fertility rate increased from 1.3 births per woman in 2006 to 1.6 in 2011, which the authorities view as an unqualified success. An unbiased demographic evaluation as well as analyses of Russian experts reveals that apparently the measures mainly caused a lowering of the age at birth and shortening of birth intervals.

These and similar questions were considered by the HSE ISSEK specialists in co-operation with the colleagues from other research entities while investigating trends in S&T at the global and national levels. The experts have analyzed socio-economic and S&T challenges affecting the ICT sector, advanced R&D fields, markets for innovative products and services, estimated the «windows of opportunities» for Russia. As a result, the strategic directions of blueprint research which ensure the basis for the creation of innovative products and new markets for the medium- and long-term (beyond 2020) perspective. Foresight results have been validated by the representatives of leading companies, research centers, universities and international organizations. Among the solutions expected in the period up to 2030 are the prototypes of systems implementing the new computing principles and multi-language software for extraction and formalization of knowledge, technologies dealing with «big data», new analytical tools (personal analytic systems, means of the real time data processing, mobile analytics, etc.). Markets for novel technology solutions are expected to be rapidly growing in healthcare, energy, engineering and transport, as well as in personal usage of ICT products and services. The study allows to conclude that in the medium to long term, the ICT sector will retain a high growth dynamic and will have transformative impact on virtually all areas of human life. The life cycle of technologies, related products and services will shorten. In this context, R&D development plays a crucial role for keeping up with competitors.

For that, we introduce sequential pattern structures, an original specification of pattern structures for dealing with sequential data. Sequential pattern structures are given by a subsumption operation between set of sequences, based on subsequence matching. To avoid a huge number of resulting concepts, domain knowledge projections can be applied. The original definition of projections is revised in order to operate on sequential pattern structures in a meaningful way. Based on the introduced definition, several projections of sequential pattern structures involving domain or expert knowledge are defined and discussed. This projections are evaluated on a real dataset on care trajectories where every hospitalization is described by a heterogeneous tuple with different fields. The evaluation reveals interesting concepts and justify the usage of introduced projections of sequential pattern structures. This research work provides a new and efficient extension of FCA to deal with complex data, which can be an alternative to the analysis of sequential datasets. © paper author(s), 2013.","Formal concept analysis; Pattern structures; Projections; Sequences; Sequential pattern structures","Information analysis; Textile printing; Domain knowledge; Expert knowledge; Pattern structure; Projections; Sequences; Sequential data; Sequential patterns; Subsequence matching; Formal concept analysis","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924409264

A resource workflow net (RWF-net) is a workflow net, supplied with an additional set of initially marked resource places. Resources can be consumed and/or produced by transitions. We do not constrain neither the intermediate nor final resource markings, hence a net can have an infinite number of different reachable states. An initially marked RWF-net is called sound if it properly terminates and, moreover, adding any extra initial resource does not violate its proper termination. An (unmarked) RWF-net is sound if it is sound for some initial resource. In this paper we prove the decidability of both marked and unmarked soundness for a restricted class of RWF-nets with a single unbounded resource place (1-dim RWF-nets).

We formulate this problem as a multi-commodity flow problem in a large space-time graph. Three approaches are proposed to solve the Linear Programming relaxation of this formulation: direct solution by an LP solver, a column generation approach based on the path reformulation, and a ""column generation for extended formulations"" approach. In the latter, the multi-commodity flow formulation is solved iteratively by dynamic generation of arc flow variables. Three approaches have been tested on a set of real-life instances provided by one of the largest freight rail transportation companies in Russia. Instances with up to 10 millions of arc flow variables were solved within minutes of computational time.","Column generation; Freight routing; Multi-commodity flow","Iterative methods; Linear programming; Rail motor cars; Railroad transportation; Column generation; Column generation approach; Extended formulations; Freight routing; Linear programming relaxation; Multi-commodity flow; Rail transportation; Transportation demand; Flow graphs","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905861082

Rather, and more specifically, verb forms expressing reference to the past or conveying perfective semantics are more impaired than verb forms expressing reference to the non-past (present or future) or conveying imperfective semantics, both in comprehension and production. The present study used some structural properties of Russian to systematically test the interaction of time reference and aspect in non-fluent and fluent aphasia.The Test for Assessment of Reference of Time (TART; Bastiaanse, Jonkers, & Thompson, 2008; Russian version Dragoy & Bastiaanse, 2010) was used to elicit production of four verb forms in sentence context: past perfective, non-past perfective, past imperfective and non-past imperfective. The results showed that non-past time reference had a general advantage over past time reference, all aspectual forms being collapsed. However, an interaction between time reference and aspect was found: imperfective verbs were better produced in the non-past, whereas production of perfective verbs was better preserved in the past time frame. Non-fluent and fluent aphasic speakers showed largely overlapping performance.These results demonstrated that the advantage of a particular time reference depends on aspectual characteristics of the verb. The performance of both non-fluent and fluent aphasic speakers can be explained in terms of prototypical and non-prototypical matches of time reference and aspectual semantics: perfectives primarily refer to completed, past events while imperfectives prototypically describe ongoing, non-past events. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Aphasia; Aspect; Russian; Tense; Time reference","adult; aphasia; article; clinical article; controlled study; ethnic group; female; grammar; human; male; phoneme; priority journal; Russian Federation; semantics; speech articulation; speech rate; stimulus response; task performance; time perception","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867197422

Factors identified by American researchers are analyzed in the context of affecting the modification of the university paradigm in Russian education. Apart from challenges posing external threats for the higher education system as an economic sector, there is one internal challenge specific of Russia. Higher education is largely simulated in Russia, as inefficient universities create accessible state-funded places but do not provide quality education services. The authors find something that American researchers did not cover in their report but what is of great importance for Russian education - that is the need to perform a deep and radical transformation of the secondary education system in order to provide opportunities for high performance of universities. Models of universities of the future suggested in the report are explored to see if they can be applied to the Russian educational system.

To control for effects of the processing of negation as such, neutral adverbs were also presented in negative and affirmative contexts. The results did not show any significant effect of negation for the non-polar adverbs, allowing context effects for polarity items to be interpreted as being due to the appropriateness of the context. Negative polarity violations elicited an N400 response that might reflect the lack of semantic congruity of the negative polarity item in an affirmative context. In contrast, processing positive polarity items in context of negation resulted in a positive effect resembling the P600, which may be considered as a marker of a different sort of integration difficulty caused by violation of licensing conditions and/or a search for a licensor in the wider discourse context. The study presented here is the first to show an unambiguous dissociation between responses to negative and positive polarity violations. This dissociation argues for different mechanisms underlying the processing of these two types of polarity; we propose that positive polarity items are sensitive to wider discourse context, while negative polarity items are more sensitive to local lexical context. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","ERPs; Language comprehension; Negative polarity positive polarity; Processing of negation","adult; affirmative action; article; behavior; cognition; event related potential; female; human; human experiment; integration; linguistics; male; medical ethics; negative polarity; normal human; polarization; positive polarity; semantics; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Comprehension; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Linguistics; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time; Semantics; Time Factors; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870991617

We use high-energy Earth orbits that can be drastically modified with lunar swingbys and small propulsive maneuvers, especially near the collinear Sun-Earth and Earth-Moon libration points. The work builds on ideas developed by the International Academy of Astronautics' exploration study group presented at the 2008 International Astronautical Congress in Glasgow. The first human missions beyond low-Earth orbit will probably go to the vicinity of the translunar Earth-Moon libration point; these are discussed in separate papers. This paper will concentrate on the next possible step, which might be for servicing large space telescopes in Sun-Earth libration-point orbits. Next, flyby and rendezvous missions to Near-Earth Objects (NEO's) will be presented, with some emphasis on options for defense against potentially hazardous objects. Finally, trajectories to reach Mars, first to Phobos and/or Deimos, will be outlined. The study will use highly-elliptical Earth orbits (HEOs) whose line of apsides can be rotated using lunar swingbys. The HEO also provides a convenient and relatively fast location for rendezvous with crew, or to add propulsion or cargo modules, a technique that we call ""Phasing Orbit Rendezvous"". From a HEO, a propulsive maneuver, considerably smaller than that needed from a circular low-Earth orbit, can be applied at the right perigee to send the spacecraft on the right departure asymptote to a desired destination. A propulsive maneuver at perigee can be used to re-capture the spacecraft into a loosely-bound orbit at the return, perhaps helped with a lunar swingby. But the astronauts onboard could separate in an Apollo-style capsule for a direct Earth return. Earth-Moon (and possibly Sun-Earth) libration point orbits and double-lunar swingby orbits, like those flown first by the third International Sun-Earth Explorer, will be used, along with time to change the orbital orientation between missions. There might be waits of several months between missions, when the interplanetary spacecraft could be ""parked"" in a small-amplitude Lissajous orbit about a libration point, similar to that flown by the WMAP mission. During that time, if there wasn't an L2 space telescope needing servicing, the spacecraft could be unmanned and controlled remotely from the Earth. Sequential missions to fly by and then rendezvous with NEO's will be described, followed by a mission to the Martian moons.",,"Computer software reusability; International cooperation; Interplanetary flight; Manned space flight; Orbits; Space telescopes; Spacecraft; Circular low-Earth orbits; International Academy of Astronautics; International collaborations; International sun-earth explorers; Libration point orbits; Near earth objects; Orbital orientation; Potentially Hazardous Objects; Lunar missions","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904605721

This will require the prediction of disease development risks, subclinical diagnostics with the precise staging of the pathological process, and, finally, the application as early as possible of targeted pharmacotherapeutic methods in order to prevent the manifestation of the disease or its progression into more severe stages.

A brief measure was developed and refined across 19 nations (Study 1: N = 5,241), showing good psychometric properties for cross-cultural use and correlating well at the nation level with other supposed facets and indicators of I-C. In Study 2 (N = 8,652), nation-level contextualism predicted ingroup favoritism, corruption, and differential trust of ingroup and outgroup members, while controlling for other facets of I-C, across 35 nations.
