So it is necessary to have effective and flexible program tools for computer network design and simulation. Network simulator must design and investigate not only hardware, but software too, explore computer networks, considering in particular the specific characteristics of a variety of computer networks.

Methods addressing this problem commonly search for clusters of pattern occurrences that are statistically significant. A measure of statistical significance is the P-value of a number of pattern occurrences, i.e. the probability to find at least S occurrences of words from a pattern H in a random text of length N generated according to a given probability model. All words of the pattern are supposed to be of same length. Results: We present a novel algorithm SUFPREF that computes an exact P-value for Hidden Markov models (HMM). The algorithm is based on recursive equations on text sets related to pattern occurrences; the equations can be used for any probability model. The algorithm inductively traverses a specific data structure, an overlap graph. The nodes of the graph are associated with the overlaps of words from H. The edges are associated to the prefix and suffix relations between overlaps. An originality of our data structure is that pattern H need not be explicitly represented in nodes or leaves. The algorithm relies on the Cartesian product of the overlap graph and the graph of HMM states; this approach is analogous to the automaton approach from JBCB 4: 553-569. The gain in size of SUFPREF data structure leads to significant improvements in space and time complexity compared to existent algorithms. The algorithm SufPref was implemented as a C++ program; the program can be used both as Web-server and a stand alone program for Linux and Windows. The program interface admits special formats to describe probability models of various types (HMM, Bernoulli, Markov); a pattern can be described with a list of words, a PSSM, a degenerate pattern or a word and a number of mismatches. It is available at http://server2.lpm.org.ru/bio/online/sf/. The program was applied to compare sensitivity and specificity of methods for TFBS prediction based on P-values computed for Bernoulli models, Markov models of orders one and two and HMMs. The experiments show that the methods have approximately the same qualities. © 2014 Regnier et al.","Hidden Markov model; P-value; Pattern occurrences; PSSM (PWM)",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928652874

This analysis reviews national efforts to achieve UHC. With a broad range of health indicators, life expectancy (ranging from 53 years to 73 years), and mortality rate in children younger than 5 years (ranging from 10·3 to 44·6 deaths per 1000 livebirths), a review of progress in each of the BRICS countries shows that each has some way to go before achieving UHC. The BRICS countries show substantial, and often similar, challenges in moving towards UHC. On the basis of a review of each country, the most pressing problems are: raising insufficient public spending; stewarding mixed private and public health systems; ensuring equity; meeting the demands for more human resources; managing changing demographics and disease burdens; and addressing the social determinants of health. Increases in public funding can be used to show how BRICS health ministries could accelerate progress to achieve UHC. Although all the BRICS countries have devoted increased resources to health, the biggest increase has been in China, which was probably facilitated by China's rapid economic growth. However, the BRICS country with the second highest economic growth, India, has had the least improvement in public funding for health. Future research to understand such different levels of prioritisation of the health sector in these countries could be useful. Similarly, the role of strategic purchasing in working with powerful private sectors, the effect of federal structures, and the implications of investment in primary health care as a foundation for UHC could be explored. These issues could serve as the basis on which BRICS countries focus their efforts to share ideas and strategies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Article; Brazil; childhood mortality; China; demography; economic development; funding; health care cost; health care policy; health care system; health insurance; human; India; life expectancy; primary health care; public health; Russian Federation; social determinants of health; South Africa; total quality management; universal health coverage; economics; health care delivery; health care financing; health care policy; insurance; organization and management; statistics and numerical data; Brazil; China; Delivery of Health Care; Health Care Reform; Healthcare Financing; Humans; India; Russia; South Africa; Universal Coverage","English",Note,Scopus,2-s2.0-84917673107

Presently the majority of countries participate in national testing; however, the past two decades have seen a substantial shift in test characteristics and aims. This article investigates the global transformation toward testing for accountability, where intentional or unintentional positive or negative consequences are applied to educators (teachers and administrators) based on their student’s test scores, in light of the emerging global culture, identified by World Culture theorists. Elements of the world culture – including the expansion of western education models, an emphasis on academic intelligence, faith in science as a rational path to truth, and the decentralization of authority to the local level – justify the establishment of testing for accountability systems. Descriptive evidence from regional and international datasets, such as PISA, PIRLS, and TIMSS, illustrate the speed at which this transformation occurs. The convergence of countries toward testing for accountability and its position as an increasingly normative policy lever is illustrated in brief vignettes from the diverse systems of Hungary, Mexico, and South Korea. As testing for accountability becomes embedded in the world culture as a legitimate tool for education reform it is less prone to critical reflection. If the potential benefits and concerns of testing for accountability, outlined in this article, are not thoughtfully evaluated this global transformation will lead to a testing culture that is internalized as normative and adopted as individual values. © 2014, Arizona State University.

To meet this objective, we compare developments in the quality of undergraduate engineering programs across elite and non-elite higher education tiers within and across each BRIC country.

Recent neuroimaging studies in monolinguals indicated that core language areas in human neocortex together with sensorimotor structures form a highly interactive system underpinning native language comprehension. While the experience of a native speaker promotes the establishment of strong action-perception links in the comprehension network, this may not necessarily be the case for L2 where, as it has been argued, the most a typical L2 speaker may get is a link between an L2 wordform and its L1 translation equivalent. Therefore, we investigated, whether the motor cortex of bilingual subjects shows differential involvement in processing action semantics of native and non-native words. We used high-density EEG to dynamically measure changes in the cortical motor system's activity, indexed by event-related desynchronisation (ERD) of the mu-rhythm, in response to passively reading L1 (German) and L2 (English) action words. Analysis of motor-related EEG oscillations at the sensor level revealed an early (starting ~. 150. ms) and left-lateralised coupling between action and semantics during both L1 and L2 processing. Crucially, source-level activation in the motor areas showed that mu-rhythm ERD, while present for both languages, is significantly stronger for L1 words. This is the first neurophysiological evidence of rapid motor-cortex involvement during L2 action-semantic processing. Our results both strengthen embodied cognition evidence obtained previously in monolinguals and, at the same time, reveal important quantitative differences between L1 and L2 sensorimotor brain activity in language comprehension. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Electroencephalography (EEG); Embodied cognition; Event-related desyncronisation (ERD); Lexical semantics; Motor cortex; Mu rhythm; Second-language processing (L2)","adult; Article; brain function; cognition; comprehension; electroencephalography; evoked response; female; human; human experiment; information processing; language ability; male; motor cortex; mu rhythm; neocortex; neurophysiology; normal human; oscillation; perception; reading; semantics; sensorimotor cortex; sensorimotor function; volunteer; comprehension; electroencephalogram; motor cortex; multilingualism; physiology; Adult; Brain Waves; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Male; Motor Cortex; Multilingualism; Semantics","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907160933

The distributed nature of the MAS facilitates design of scalable implementations in modern cloud environments. We also propose a planning algorithm based on combinatorial auctions (CA) that allows to express commodity of multiple transportation scenarios by evident means of the bids. Using the mechanism of CA we may fully take into account the presence of complementariness and substitutability among the items that differ across bidders. Further, we describe design principles of our proposed software with a prototype implementation. We believe that our approach to multi-agent modeling is general enough to provide the flexibility necessary for adoption of DRT-services modeling into real-world scenarios.

The time course of lexical access, as well as lexical selection and integration was studied using a visual-world paradigm in three groups of Russian speakers: 36 individuals in the control group, 15 individuals with non-fluent aphasia and eight individuals with fluent aphasia. Participants listened to temporarily ambiguous sentences wherein the context biased the interpretation of an ambiguous word toward one of its two meanings. In half of the experimental sentences, a reanalysis was needed upon encountering the disambiguating phrase. The effect of the length of the intervening material between the ambiguous word and the disambiguation point was additionally monitored. All groups of participants showed intact lexical access under slowed speech rate, but non-fluent participants experienced difficulties with timely activation of multiple referents. At later stages of lexical processing, they additionally demonstrated a specific impairment of reanalysis. The deficit in participants with fluent aphasia was not focalized at any specific stage of lexical processing. Rather, the breakdown of lexical processes in fluent aphasia was likely related to difficulties with the inhibition of irrelevant lexical activation, which is further supported by the finding that increased phonological distance between the ambiguous word and ambiguity resolution was influential to the offline performance in this group. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Ambiguity; Aphasia; Eye-tracking; Lexical processing","accuracy; adult; aged; ambiguity; aphasia; Article; brain damage; clinical article; comprehension; controlled study; eye fixation; eye tracking; female; fluent aphasia; human; left hemisphere; male; middle aged; neuroimaging; nonfluent aphasia; phonetics; response time; Russian (people); speech rate; ataxic aphasia; cortical sensory aphasia; eye movement; language; neuropsychological test; oculography; pathophysiology; physiology; Adult; Aged; Aphasia, Broca; Aphasia, Wernicke; Comprehension; Eye Movement Measurements; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Language; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908616683

While complex spatio-temporal dynamics are a hallmark of neuronal oscillations, they also represent a formidable challenge for the proper extraction and quantification of oscillatory activity with non-invasive recording techniques such as EEG and MEG. In order to facilitate the study of neuronal oscillations we present a general-purpose pre-processing approach, which can be applied for a wide range of analyses including but not restricted to inverse modeling and multivariate single-trial classification. The idea is to use dimensionality reduction with spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD) instead of the commonly and almost exclusively used principal component analysis (PCA). The key advantage of SSD lies in selecting components explaining oscillations-related variance instead of just any variance as in the case of PCA. For the validation of SSD pre-processing we performed extensive simulations with different inverse modeling algorithms and signal-to-noise ratios. In all these simulations SSD invariably outperformed PCA often by a large margin. Moreover, using a database of multichannel EEG recordings from 80 subjects we show that pre-processing with SSD significantly increases the performance of single-trial classification of imagined movements, compared to the classification with PCA pre-processing or without any dimensionality reduction. Our simulations and analysis of real EEG experiments show that, while not being supervised, the SSD algorithm is capable of extracting components primarily relating to the signal of interest often using as little as 20% of the data variance, instead of > 90% variance as in case of PCA. Given its ease of use, absence of supervision, and capability to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of multivariate EEG/MEG data, we advocate the application of SSD pre-processing for the analysis of spontaneous and induced neuronal oscillations in normal subjects and patients. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Brain oscillations; Dimensionality reduction; Principal component analysis; Spatio-spectral decomposition","adult; analysis of variance; Article; brain computer interface; brain electrophysiology; brain oscillation; computer simulation; controlled study; data analysis; electroencephalogram; human; learning algorithm; magnetoencephalography; multifactor dimensionality reduction; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; principal component analysis; signal noise ratio; spatial analysis; spatio spectral decomposition algorithm; theory validation; brain; electroencephalography; physiology; procedures; signal processing; statistical analysis; Adult; Brain; Brain Waves; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Electroencephalography; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Principal Component Analysis; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907034185

At an ambient pressure, with decreasing temperature a drastic drop in χ(T) was confirmed at T≃ 6065K, which appears to be closely related to the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. It is found that the magnitudes of the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility Δχ in the AFM phase are close in the studied samples, whereas the sign of the anisotropy apparently depends on the small variations of the excess iron y in Fe 1 +yTe samples. The performed DFT calculations of the electronic structure and magnetic properties for the stoichiometric FeTe compound indicate the presence of frustrated AFM ground states. There are very close energies and magnetic moments for the double stripe configurations, with the AFM axes oriented either on the basal plane or along the [0 0 1] direction.

The new city is being built from scratch next to Kazan', the capital of Tatarstan Republic - this is also a challenge by itself. The idea is to use the synergy of IT academicians, researchers and practitioners in a single location. The Innovation City will incorporate a kindergarten, a STEM training school, a university and an IT park. Of these, the university will act as the brain for the entire project. The primary focus of the university curricula is software engineering. Currently, Innoplois faculty training is underway at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), the birthplace of the software engineering, and the top ranked university in the field. Research and project practice are tightly coupled within the CMU SE master's program, the CMU course sequence is well justified, while each individual course is thoroughly planned. However, direct curricula copying from CMU to Innopolis would be too obvious solution to be correct. The paper discusses ways of context-specific adjustment of the CMU MSE courses to meet the new Russian university objectives. These curricula tailoring suggestions are based on the takeaways from the author's recent CMU visiting faculty experience, the primary focus of which has been SE training to be applied at Innopolis shortly.

Modeling revealed two potential mechanisms for the drop in accumbal dopamine efflux evoked by the selective α7 partial agonist TC-7020. TC-7020 could desensitize α7 NNRs located predominantly on dopamine neurons or glutamatergic afferents to them or, alternatively, activate α7 NNRs located on the glutamatergic afferents to GABAergic interneurons in the ventral tegmental area.

The author defines autonomy and articulates its three components - life goals and moral rules, affective and sensual demands, and social norms and expectations, and three levels of processing these components - awareness/mindfulness, reflectivity, and decision making. He states that sense of self, which function at two levels: a core experiential pre-reflective self and an autobiographical, narrative, and reflected self, constitutes the center of autonomous functioning of every human being. He uses arguments from developmental, social, and cultural psychology to validate his position that human autonomy is a culturally universal phenomenon. Autonomy requires for its development a socio-cultural environment, thus, everywhere where there are meaningful social interactions mediated by language it may emerge. The author also differentiates cultural models and ideologies of independent/individualistic versus interdependent/collectivistic selves from a first-person, perspectival self that initiates and regulates autonomous functioning and discusses the consequences of confusion between these understandings. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First we study the singularities of the above spaces (as was explained by Finkelberg and Mirković in 1999 and Braverman in 2006 they are supposed to model singularities of the not rigorously defined ``semi-infinite Schubert varieties''). We show that Za gis normal and when g is simply laced, Za g is Gorenstein and has rational singularities; some weaker results are proved also in the affine case. The second purpose is to study the character of the ring of functions on Za g. When g is finite-dimensional and simply laced we show that the generating function of these characters satisfies the ``fermionic formula'' version of quantum difference Toda equation, thus extending the results for g=S[(N)from Givental and Lee in 2003 and Braverman and Finkelberg in 2005; in view of the first part this also proves a conjecture from Givental and Lee in 2003 describing the quantum K-theory of Bg in terms of the Langlands dual quantum group Uq(ǧ) (for non-simply laced g certain modification of that conjecture is necessary).

Our approach is biologically grounded in a theory of how the human visual system solves this problem, focusing on shapes that are mirror symmetrical in 3-D. A 3-D mirror-symmetrical shape can be recovered from a single 2-D orthographic or perspective image by applying several a priori constraints: 3-D mirror symmetry, 3-D compactness, and planarity of contours. From the computational point of view, the application of a 3-D symmetry constraint is challenging because it requires establishing 3-D symmetry correspondence among features of a 2-D image, which itself is asymmetrical for almost all viewing directions relative to the 3-D symmetrical shape.

While the effect of mixing on the evaluation of evoked responses and connectivity measures has been extensively studied, there are, to date, no studies reporting on the differences in the values of the estimated Hurst exponents when moving between sensor and source space representations of the multivariate data or on the effect of noise. Such differences, if not duly acknowledged, may lead to erroneous data interpretations. We show in simulations and in theory that measuring Hurst exponents in sensor space may lead to an incomplete picture of the LRTC properties of the underlying data and that noise may significantly bias the estimate of the Hurst exponent of the underlying signal. Moreover, these predictions are confirmed in real data, where we analyze the amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations in the resting state from EEG data. By moving either to an independent components representation or to a source representation which maximizes the signal to noise ratio in the alpha frequency range, we observe greater variance, skewness and kurtosis over measured Hurst exponents than in sensor space. We confirm the suitability of conventional source separation methodology by introducing a novel algorithm HeMax which obtains a source maximizing the Hurst exponent in the amplitude dynamics of narrow band oscillations. Our findings imply that the long-range correlative properties of the EEG should be studied in source space, in such a way that the SNR is maximized, or at least with spatial decomposition techniques approximating source activities, rather than in sensor space. © 2014.",,"algorithm; alpha rhythm; article; controlled study; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography phase synchronization; female; human; human experiment; Hurst exponent estimation; Hurst exponent maximization algorithm; Kurtosis; linear mixing effect; long range temporal correlation; male; mathematical phenomena; mu rhythm; nervous system potential; noise; normal human; occipital cortex; parietal cortex; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; process optimization; quantitative analysis; resting state network; sensor space; signal noise ratio; simulation; skewness; spatial spectral decomposition; statistical analysis; statistical bias; statistical concepts; statistical distribution; statistical model; statistical parameters; superimposed noise; time series analysis; validation process; volume conductor; algorithm; computer simulation; electroencephalography; magnetoencephalography; procedures; signal processing; statistical analysis; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Electroencephalography; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903539106

To enhance the temporal resolution for coupling delays down to millisecond level, a new power correlation (PC) method is proposed and tested. New method: The cross-correlations of any two brainwave powers at two locations are calculated sequentially through a measurement using the convolution theorem. For noise suppression, the cross-correlation series is moving-average filtered, preserving the millisecond resolution in the cross-correlations, but with reduced noise. The coupling delays are determined from the delays of the cross-correlation peaks. Results: Simulations showed that the new method detects reliably power cross-correlations with millisecond accuracy. Moreover, in MEG measurements on three healthy volunteers, the method showed average alpha-alpha coupling delays of around 0-20. ms between the occipital areas of two hemispheres. Lower-frequency brainwaves vs. alpha waves tended to have a larger lag; higher-frequency waves vs. alpha waves showed delays with large deviations. Comparison with existing methods: The use of signal power instead of its square root (amplitude) in the cross-correlations improves noise cancellation. Compared to signal phase, the signal power analysis time delays do not have periodic ambiguity. In addition, the novel method allows fast calculation of cross-correlations. Conclusions: The PC method conveys novel information about brainwave dynamics. The method may be extended from sensor-space to source-space analysis, and can be applied also for electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Brainwave; Coupling; MEG; Millisecond resolution; Power correlation","accuracy; alpha rhythm; article; electroencephalogram; frontal lobe; human; magnetoencephalography; measurement; noise reduction; normal human; occipital lobe; power analysis; priority journal; signal processing; simulation; time; algorithm; biological model; brain; computer simulation; electroencephalogram; magnetoencephalography; physiology; procedures; rest; signal processing; validation study; Algorithms; Alpha Rhythm; Brain; Brain Waves; Computer Simulation; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Models, Neurological; Rest; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904127150

Development Goal (MDG 5) established the goal of a 75% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR; number of maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths) between 1990 and 2015. We aimed to measure levels and track trends in maternal mortality, the key causes contributing to maternal death, and timing of maternal death with respect to delivery. Methods We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to analyse a database of data for 7065 site-years and estimate the number of maternal deaths from all causes in 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. We estimated the number of pregnancy-related deaths caused by HIV on the basis of a systematic review of the relative risk of dying during pregnancy for HIV-positive women compared with HIV-negative women. We also estimated the fraction of these deaths aggravated by pregnancy on the basis of a systematic review. To estimate the numbers of maternal deaths due to nine diff erent causes, we identified 61 sources from a systematic review and 943 site-years of vital registration data. We also did a systematic review of reports about the timing of maternal death, identifying 142 sources to use in our analysis. We developed estimates for each country for 1990-2013 using Bayesian meta-regression. We estimated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all values. Findings 292 982 (95% UI 261 017-327 792) maternal deaths occurred in 2013, compared with 376 034 (343 483-407 574) in 1990. The global annual rate of change in the MMR was -0.3% (-1.1 to 0.6) from 1990 to 2003, and -2.7% (-3.9 to -1.5) from 2003 to 2013, with evidence of continued acceleration. MMRs reduced consistently in south, east, and southeast Asia between 1990 and 2013, but maternal deaths increased in much of sub-Saharan Africa during the 1990s. 2070 (1290-2866) maternal deaths were related to HIV in 2013, 0.4% (0.2-0.6) of the global total. MMR was highest in the oldest age groups in both 1990 and 2013. In 2013, most deaths occurred intrapartum or postpartum. Causes varied by region and between 1990 and 2013. We recorded substantial variation in the MMR by country in 2013, from 956.8 (685.1-1262.8) in South Sudan to 2.4 (1.6-3.6) in Iceland. Interpretation Global rates of change suggest that only 16 countries will achieve the MDG 5 target by 2015. Accelerated reductions since the Millennium Declaration in 2000 coincide with increased development assistance for maternal, newborn, and child health. Setting of targets and associated interventions for after 2015 will need careful consideration of regions that are making slow progress, such as west and central Africa.

Here, we investigated with three different neuroimaging modalities [magnetoencephalography (MEG), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state fMRI] whether spastic CP is associated with functional and anatomical abnormalities in the sensorimotor network. Ten children participated in the study: four with diplegic CP (DCP), three with hemiplegic CP (HCP), and three typically developing (TD) children. Somatosensory (SS)-evoked fields (SEFs) were recorded in response to pneumatic stimuli applied to digits D1, D3, and D5 of both hands. Several parameters of water diffusion were calculated from DTI between the thalamus and the pre-central and post-central gyri in both hemispheres. The sensorimotor resting-state networks (RSNs) were examined by using an independent component analysis method. Tactile stimulation of the fingers elicited the first prominent cortical response at ~50 ms, in all except one child, localized over the primary SS cortex (S1). In five CP children, abnormal somatotopic organization was observed in the affected (or more affected) hemisphere. Euclidean distances were markedly different between the two hemispheres in the HCP children, and between DCP and TD children for both hemispheres. DTI analysis revealed decreased fractional anisotropy and increased apparent diffusion coefficient for the thalamocortical pathways in the more affected compared to less affected hemisphere in CP children. Resting-state functional MRI results indicated absent and/or abnormal sensorimotor RSNs for children with HCP and DCP consistent with the severity and location of their lesions.

Official statistics on manufactured alcohol sales, regional price increase and real disposable income were used.Results: Homemade distilled spirits (samogon) consumption decreased together with that of recorded and unrecorded manufactured spirits since 2000. The consumption of spirits was partially replaced by the consumption of beer and wine. These trends in alcohol consumption were interrupted in 2008-2013. The interruption was more likely affected by the economic crisis and recession than by the new alcohol policy. Social networks and availability of unrecorded alcohol were more important predictors of homemade alcohol consumption and purchasing than was a recorded alcohol price increase.Conclusions: Homemade alcohol consumption does not replace the declining market for recorded spirits in Russia. The effects of economic and social factors on homemade alcohol consumption are greater than are the short-term effects of the new alcohol policy.

The irregularity indices λ are computed within 4-year sliding windows, with embedding dimensions m= 1 and 2. λISSN displays Schwabe cycles with ∼5.5-year variations (""half Schwabe variations"" HSV). The mean of λISSN undergoes a downward step and the amplitude of its variations strongly decreases around 1930. We observe changes in the ratio R of the mean amplitude of λ peaks at solar cycle minima with respect to peaks at solar maxima as a function of date, embedding dimension and, importantly, smoothing parameter N. We identify two distinct regimes, called Q1 and Q2, defined mainly by the evolution of R as a function of N: Q1, with increasing HSV behavior and R value as N is increased, occurs before 1915-1930; and Q2, with decreasing HSV behavior and R value as N is increased, occurs after ∼1975. We attempt to account for these observations with an autoregressive (order 1) model with Poissonian noise and a mean modulated by two sine waves of periods T<inf>1</inf> and T<inf>2</inf> (T<inf>1</inf> = 11 years, and intermediate T<inf>2</inf> is tuned to mimic quasibiennial oscillations QBO). The model can generate both Q1 and Q2 regimes. When m= 1, HSV appears in the absence of T<inf>2</inf> variations. When m= 2, Q1 occurs when T<inf>2</inf> variations are present, whereas Q2 occurs when T <inf>2</inf> variations are suppressed. We propose that the HSV behavior of the irregularity index of ISSN may be linked to the presence of strong QBO before 1915-1930, a transition and their disappearance around 1975, corresponding to a change in regime of solar activity. © Author(s) 2014.",,"amplitude; numerical model; Poisson ratio; solar activity; sunspot; Simplexvirus","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921481244

On the other hand, cross-frequency communications are more flexible allowing interactions between oscillations with different frequencies. Among such cross-frequency interactions amplitude-to-amplitude interactions are of a special interest as they show how the strength of spatial synchronization in different neuronal populations relates to each other during a given task. While, previously, amplitude-to-amplitude correlations were studied primarily on the sensor level, we present a source separation approach using spatial filters which maximize the correlation between the envelopes of brain oscillations recorded with electro-/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) or intracranial multichannel recordings. Our approach, which is called canonical source power correlation analysis (cSPoC), is thereby capable of extracting genuine brain oscillations solely based on their assumed coupling behavior even when the signal-to-noise ratio of the signals is low. In addition to using cSPoC for the analysis of cross-frequency interactions in the same subject, we show that it can also be utilized for studying amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations across subjects. We assess the performance of cSPoC in simulations as well as in three distinctively different analysis scenarios of real EEG data, each involving several subjects. In the simulations, cSPoC outperforms unsupervised state-of-the-art approaches. In the analysis of real EEG recordings, we demonstrate excellent unsupervised discovery of meaningful power-to-power couplings, within as well as across subjects and frequency bands. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cross-frequency coupling; CSPoC; ECoG; EEG; LFP; MEG; Neural oscillations; Power-to-power coupling; SPoC","action potential; article; brain computer interface; brain electrophysiology; brain oscillation; canonical source power correlation analysis; correlation analysis; electrocorticography; electroencephalography; female; human; human experiment; local field potential; magnetoencephalography; male; multichannel recorder; nervous system parameters; neuroimaging; normal human; priority journal; signal noise ratio; stimulus response; algorithm; biological rhythm; brain; brain mapping; computer assisted diagnosis; electroencephalogram; image enhancement; nerve cell network; oscillometry; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; signal processing; statistical analysis; Algorithms; Biological Clocks; Brain; Brain Mapping; Brain Waves; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetoencephalography; Nerve Net; Oscillometry; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901068817

While up till that time the focus had been primarily on very general issues (such as the mean intelligence of cultural populations or ethnocultural groups), research began to move away from such general issues in order to discern relationships between specific features of cognitive development and performance, and specific features of and experiences in particular cultures. While some of these broad generalizations have continued, research became more contextualized, and focused on the particular features of individuals' home, school, or neighborhood experiences, and how these features impact their cognitive development and performance. In this chapter, some basic frameworks from the field of cross-cultural psychology are employed to examine the research on the relationship between culture and cognition. These are the universalist perspective on cognition in cultural context, and the ecocultural framework, which seeks to understand the cognitive adaptation and development of persons living in particular habitats. The combination of these two perspectives provides a basis for examining both the underlying similarities in cognitive processes and the cultural variation in cognitive development (competence) and display (performance). Some conclusions are drawn from this overview: conceptions of cognitive abilities are now less ethnocentric; assessments are now more culturally appropriate; and interpretations and applications of the findings are now more in tune with the needs of people in the societies in which research is being carried out. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The post-Soviet transformation brings new forces that shaped institutional diversity. Following that, the historical typology of institutions is investigated with regard to the major forces influencing these universities' development. Taking into account both the historical legacy and the crucial post-Soviet period (1990s–2000s), a typology of new types of higher education institutions is set forth. It represents an extreme case of state-authorized higher education facing market forces. The state abandons its monopoly on demand in higher education and cannot fully control the supply side.

At the end of the 20th century, a higher demand for flexible labour relations was accompanied by a value shift towards the expansion of individual freedom, tolerance, and creativity. As previous research shows, non-permanent jobs often bring losses in wages, income instability, uncertainty about the future, and job dissatisfaction. This leads us to expect that flexible working relations could contribute to unhappiness and life dissatisfaction. We use the European Social Survey (2010) as an empirical basis for the analysis. The main tested idea of the paper is that countries with more liberal labour legislation have higher rates of subjective well-being as fewer people are employed on a temporary basis. The results from the regression analysis show that temporary and informal employment negatively affects subjective well-being, whereas self-employment influences subjective well-being positively. Strict employment protection legislation has negative impact on subjective well-being, especially for informal workers and temporary contractors. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

As a result, the nonlinear shallow water equations are reduced to a single one-dimensional linear wave equation for an auxiliary function and all physical variables can be expressed in terms of this function by purely algebraic formulas. In the special case of a U-shaped channel this equation coincides with a spherically symmetric wave equation in space, whose dimension is defined by the channel cross-section and can be fractional.

Many physical channels can be formally described as quantum Gaussian operations acting on bosonic quantum states. Depending on the input state and on the quality of the channel, the output suffers certain amount of noise. For a long time it has been conjectured, but never proved, that output states of Gaussian channels corresponding to coherent input signals are the less noisy ones (in the sense of a majorization criterion). Here we prove this conjecture. Specifically we show that every output state of a phase-insensitive Gaussian channel is majorized by the output state corresponding to a coherent input. The proof is based on the optimality of coherent states for the minimization of strictly concave output functionals. Moreover we show that coherent states are the unique optimizers. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Using panel regression analysis to look at the determinants of increasing state involvement, this article shows that election results for the ruling president and his party, as well as the degree to which elections are manipulated throughout Russia's regions, are significantly and positively correlated with the number of raids in a given region, while regions with governors that have stronger local ties are characterized by a smaller number of attacks. A potential interpretation of these findings is that the federal center may tolerate a certain degree of predatory activities by regional elites, as long as these elites are able to deliver a sufficiently high level of electoral support for the center, with the effect being weaker in regions where the governor is interested in the long-term development of the regional economy. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.","authoritarian electoral regimes; corporate raiding; property rights; state predation; stationary and roving bandits","corporate strategy; data set; electoral system; panel data; property rights; regional economy; regression analysis; state role; Russian Federation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897416232

We study the whole range of the transition of wormlike micelles into microemulsion droplets and discover that it can be divided into three regions: (i) in the first region, the solutions retain a high viscosity (∼10-350 Pa·s), the micelles are entangled but their length is reduced by the solubilization of hydrocarbons; (ii) in the second region, the system transitions to the unentangled regime and the viscosity sharply decreases as a result of further micelle shortening and the appearance of microemulsion droplets; (iii) in the third region, the viscosity is low (∼0.001 Pa·s) and only microemulsion droplets remain in the solution. The experimental studies were accompanied by theoretical considerations, which allowed us to reveal for the first time that (i) one of the leading mechanisms of micelle shortening is the preferential accumulation of the solubilized hydrocarbon in the spherical end caps of wormlike micelles, which makes the end caps thermodynamically more favorable; (ii) the onset of the sharp drop in viscosity is correlated with the crossover from the entangled to unentangled regime of the wormlike micellar solution taking place upon the shortening of micellar chains; and (iii) in the unentangled regime short cylindrical micelles coexist with microemulsion droplets. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Chains; Drops; Hydrocarbons; Microemulsions; Viscoelasticity; Viscosity; Cylindrical micelles; High viscosities; Orders of magnitude; Potassium oleate; Rheological property; System transitions; Worm-like micelles; Wormlike micellar solutions; Micelles","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897973624

However, these studies have predominantly examined national events. The aim of this study is to provide a statistical evaluation of the relationship between mass gatherings in some relatively small urban sub-populations and the general suicide rates of a major city. Methods. The data were gathered in the Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, with a population of 1 million people, in 2005-2010. Suicide attempts, suicides, and the total amount of suicide-related behaviours were registered daily for each sex. Bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis, including negative binomial regression, were applied to assess the risk of suicide-related behaviour in the city's general population for 7 days before and after 427 mass gatherings, such as concerts, football games, and non-regular mass events organized by the Orthodox Church and new religious movements. Results: The bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses found significant changes in some suicide-related behaviour rates in the city's population after certain kinds of mass gatherings. In particular, we observed an increased relative risk (RR) of male suicide-related behaviour after a home defeat of the local football team (RR = 1.32, p = 0.047; regression coefficient beta = 0.371, p = 0.002), and an increased risk of male suicides (RR = 1.29, p = 0.006; beta =0.255, p = 0.002), male suicide-related behaviour (RR = 1.25, p = 0.019; beta =0.251, p < 0.001), and total suicide-related behaviour (RR = 1.23 p < 0.001; beta =0.187, p < 0.001) after events organized by the new religious movements. Conclusions: Although football games and mass events organized by new religious movements involved a relatively small part of an urban population (1.6 and 0.3%, respectively), we observed a significant increase of the some suicide-related behaviour rates in the whole population. It is likely that the observed effect on suicide-related behaviour is related to one's personal presence at the event rather than to its broadcast. Our findings can be explained largely in terms of Gabennesch's theory of the 'broken-promises effect' with regard to intra- and interpersonal conflict and, in terms of crowd behaviour effects. © 2014 Usenko et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Broken-promises effect; Concerts; Conflict; Crowd behaviour; Football; Mass gatherings; New religious movements; Religion; Suicide; Suicide attempt","crowding (area); female; football; human; male; mass behavior; regression analysis; religion; risk factor; soccer; social behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide; suicide attempt; Ukraine; urban population; violence; Crowding; Female; Football; Humans; Male; Mass Behavior; Regression Analysis; Religion; Risk Factors; Soccer; Social Behavior; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted; Ukraine; Urban Population; Violence","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899587387

While photon count rates are field independent at weak applied fields, they show a strong dependence at fields starting from approximately ±25 mT. This behavior, as well as the magnetic field dependence of the dark count rates, is in good agreement with the recent theoretical model of vortex-assisted photon detection and spontaneous vortex crossing in narrow superconducting lines. However, the local reduction of the superconducting free energy due to photon absorption, which is the fitting parameter in the model, increases much slower with the photon energy than the model predicts.

I find that the radical right electorate is not characterized by social alienation or anti-modern values; these characteristics are more likely to be encountered among people who abstain from elections. Radical right voting is most strongly motivated by political attitudes, namely by negative perception of immigration, political mistrust, opposition to income redistribution, and - rather unexpectedly - political satisfaction.

The authors come up with this problem since believe that the new economy conditions require an adjustment and a development of classical firm theory. Design/methodology/approach: The research question addressed in this study is mainly related to the empirical validation of the function based on companies' intangibles in the Cobb-Douglas framework. This model enables the authors to advocate the idea of the complementarity of intellectual resources as well as simplifies the analysis of intellectual capital features. To accomplish the purpose of the research, the authors design a log-linear model and estimate it on a sample of more than 400 European and American companies. Findings: Application of Cobb-Douglas framework allowed designing a production function based on intellectual capital. The complementarity of intellectual capital components is justified on the empirical results obtained in this research. The increasing return to scale for intellectual capital was established for the sample examined in this study. Research limitations/implications: The main shortcoming of the approach implemented in this study is related to the proxy indicators of intellectual capital. Nevertheless, the authors statistically validate the chosen indicators applying hedonic approach. Practical implications: Practical accomplishment of this research is mainly associated with the conclusion about an increasing return to scale of intellectual capital. This phenomenon appears to be of a particular importance for investment decisions. Originality/value: The findings of this paper provide a new insight into intellectual resources interrelation that enhances companies' value creation. The authors also hope to assist future research attempts in application of the theory of company's growth driven by its intangible capital. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cobb-Douglas; Complementarity of intellectual resources; Intangibles; Intellectual capital; Production function; Returns to scale",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893292209

Although recent evidence emphasizes the fundamental role of prior knowledge for perceptual decision making, only few studies have quantified the relevance of such priors on perceptual decisions and examined their interplay with other decision-relevant factors, such as the stimulus properties. In the present study we asked whether hysteresis, describing the stability of a percept despite a change in stimulus property and known to occur at perceptual thresholds, also acts as a form of an implicit prior in tactile spatial decision making, supporting the stability of a decision across successively presented random stimuli (i.e., decision hysteresis). We applied a variant of the classical 2-point discrimination task and found that hysteresis influenced perceptual decision making: Participants were more likely to decide 'same' rather than 'different' on successively presented pin distances. In a direct comparison between the influence of applied pin distances (explicit stimulus property) and hysteresis, we found that on average, stimulus property explained significantly more variance of participants' decisions than hysteresis. However, when focusing on pin distances at threshold, we found a trend for hysteresis to explain more variance. Furthermore, the less variance was explained by the pin distance on a given decision, the more variance was explained by hysteresis, and vice versa. Our findings suggest that hysteresis acts as an implicit prior in tactile spatial decision making that becomes increasingly important when explicit stimulus properties provide decreasing evidence. © 2014 Thiel et al.",,"adult; article; controlled study; decision making; depth perception; female; human; human experiment; hysteresis; male; mental capacity; mental task; normal human; perceptive discrimination; perceptive threshold; sensory stimulation; tactile spatial decision making; task performance; variance; decision making; physiology; psychological model; psychometry; questionnaire; touch; Adult; Decision Making; Discrimination (Psychology); Female; Humans; Male; Models, Psychological; Psychometrics; Sensory Thresholds; Space Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires; Touch Perception","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896368360

This claim is based on a finding that observers are good at representing the average when an ensemble includes only two sizes distributed among all items (regular sets), but their performance gets worse when the number of sizes increases with the number of items (irregular sets). We argue that an important factor not considered by Marchant et al. (2013) is the range of size variation that was much bigger in their irregular sets. We manipulated this factor across our experiments and found almost the same efficiency of averaging for both regular and irregular sets when the range was stabilized.

Our results provide evidence for horizontal gender segregation across branches of the economy among labour market entrants in Russia, which have been growing since 1991. Moreover, horizontal differences seem to be driving vertical gender inequalities in terms of entry into authoritative positions. Accounting for heterogeneity in education and the entered branch, we find that despite gender equality principles and full-time employment for women, vertical gender inequalities had already existed under the Soviet regime. However, these increased during the liberalization reforms. These growing vertical gender inequalities can be traced back mainly to a worsening of female chances in an economic transition, whereas there was no significant change for male entrants. Furthermore, women seem to be particularly disadvantaged among highly qualified entrants. We conclude that Russian female entrants have not fully converted their educational advantage into occupational opportunities since the transition from socialism to a liberalized market economy. © 2015 The Author.

Hence how to minimize the routing cost is also a key problem for constructing the network virtual backbone. In this paper, we study the problem of constructing applicable CDS in wireless networks in terms of size and routing cost. We formulate a wireless network as a Disk-Containment Graph (DCG), which is a generalization of the Unit-Disk Graph (UDG), and we develop an efficient algorithm to construct CDS in such kind of graphs.

Several methods may be used to decompose the data into a set of spatial components with temporal loadings. Component selection is of crucial importance, and should be supported by objective criteria. In some applications, the use of a well defined component selection criterion may provide for automation of the analysis. In this paper we describe a novel approach for ranking of spatial components calculated from the EEG or MEG data recorded within evoked response paradigm. Our method is called Mutual Information (MI) Spectrum and is based on gauging the amount of MI of spatial component temporal loadings with a synthetically created reference signal. We also describe the appropriate randomization based statistical assessment scheme that can be used for selection of components with statistically significant amount of MI. Using simulated data with realistic trial to trial variations and SNR corresponding to the real recordings we demonstrate the superior performance characteristics of the described MI based measure as compared to a more conventionally used power driven gauge. We also demonstrate the application of the MI Spectrum for the selection of task-related independent components from real MEG data. We show that the MI spectrum allows to identify task-related components reliably in a consistent fashion, yielding stable results even from a small number of trials. We conclude that the proposed method fits naturally the information driven nature of ICA and can be used for routine and automatic ranking of independent components calculated from the functional neuroimaging data collected within event-related paradigms. © 2014 Ossadtchi, Pronko, Baillet, Pflieger and Stroganova.","Components selection; Eloquent cortex mapping; ICA; Mutual information; Spatial components; SVD","article; brain mapping; electroencephalography; functional neuroimaging; independent component analysis; mathematical model; motor cortex; simulation; spatial analysis; statistical analysis","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892977800

This study performs a broad review of technical, economic, environmental and supply chain issues related to coalto- liquids (CTL) and gas-to-liquids (GTL). We find three issues predominate. First, significant amounts of coal and gas would be required to obtain anything more than a marginal production of liquids. Second, the economics of CTL plants are clearly prohibitive, but are better for GTL. Nevertheless, large-scale GTL plants still require very high upfront costs, and for three real-world GTL plants out of four, the final cost has been so far approximately three times that initially budgeted. Small-scale GTL holds potential for associated gas. Third, both CTL and GTL incur significant environmental impacts, ranging from increased greenhouse gas emissions (in the case of CTL) to water contamination.

The authors demonstrate how regime responses to these dilemmas - typically efforts to maintain control while avoiding outright repression and societal backlash - have negative outcomes, including a weakening of formal institutions, proliferation of ""substitutions"" (e.g., substitutes for institutions), and increasing centralization and personalization of control. Efforts by Russian leaders to disengage society from the sphere of decision-making entail a significant risk of systemic breakdown in unexpected ways. More specifically, given significantly weakened institutions for interest representation and negotiated compromise, policy-making in the Russian system often amounts to the leadership's best guess (ad hoc manual policy adjustments) as to precisely what society will accept and what it will not, with a significant possibility of miscalculation.

The common ground between Foucault and Gadamer is that both thinkers militate against the notion of understanding as a process guided by universal criteria of rationality (in particular against Habermas’ notion of non-distorted communication) maintaining instead that individuals are inextricably embedded within a particular tradition. Foucault, we maintain, is extremely important for Gadamer in that he develops a mode of critical relationship towards the tradition but precisely understood as a dynamic within the tradition itself, renegotiating and expanding the space of personal freedom; this process, no doubt, being guided by engaged individual perspective and self-understanding without any recourse to an Archimedean point of view outside of any tradition. In doing so Foucault is able to provide a much needed method of immanent critique of ideological distortions (potentially always present in the tradition, discourse or language) that remains faithful to the basic tenants of Gadamer’s hermeneutic outlook. We consider a model that schematically demonstrates how such immanent critique can be carried out. We take Gadamer’s notion of understanding as realised in an open and charitable dialogue and internalise this dialogue within a single subject taking place between two distinct perspectives: a critical Foucauldian perspective on the one hand, and the immediate self-undertstanding of situated subjectivity on the other. This internal dialogue should enable the subject to maintain a critical distance with respect to aspects of oneself that are a product of social practices and conditions (as demanded by critics of Gadamer), yet remaining within the space of Gadamerian dialogical understanding situated in the first-person ontology.","Dialogue; Hermeneutics of suspicion; Hermeneutics of trust; Ideology; Philosophical hermeneutics; Prejudices; Understanding",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036664289

We have also analyzed engagement of higher education institutions of different countries in the international university networks, particularly membership of the leading Russian universities in such networks and in other international educational associations. It appears that Russian universities are represented insufficiently in the international university networks.

Analyzing the fundamental principles of mass-scale writing skills teaching used in Great Britain, Canada and the US, the author suggests changing the writing skills development pattern that has been established in Russian schools. First, these changes should address the texts that serve the basis for student essays. The most impor tant features of such texts appear to be a con - flict, an emotional state easily recognized by children, and a strong author's presence. Second, it is necessary to revise the forms of writing students do in class or at home. In particular, Russian teachers are advised to learn from Graves' method of teaching children to make contents that would be meaningful for themselves and not predetermined by their teachers. Sample compositions included in language development course books is another area that needs revision. The paper gives the grounds for providing the tools consistent with the author's conception and not restricted to literary language, instead of merely teaching norms. A good source of exercise could be the Russian National Corpus, the electronic database reflecting all the current trends of contemporary writing. The author believes that implementing these ideas would promote, inter alia, association of different social groups based on acknowledging the importance of cultural traditions.","Essays; Sample compositions; School education; The Russian National Corpus; Written language",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027464573

The results on identified key competencies are presented in accordance with various age groups, and include gender and qualification level differences. PIAAC is a long-term research project. Russia participated in the programme in 2009- 2013. Over 5000 adults aged between 16 and 25 from 25 regions and 94 localities participated in the programme in Russia. The total sample included 3800 respondents; it is representative for the whole country except Moscow and Moscow Oblast. The average points Russia obtained in reading and mathematical literacy are comparable to those obtained in OECD countries. Nearly half of working-age adults in Russia either don't have any computer experience or are incompetent users. As compared to OECD citizens, computer skills of Russian adults are more often restricted to doing only simple tasks (like logging in and out of their email boxes). As the level of education grows, so does the level of competencies of adult population in Russia. Similarly, competencies seem to accumulate with ageing, until the peak age of 45-49 years is reached.

Two common European trends have been studied as driving forces of transformation: 1) institutional differentiation based on introducing the multi-level education system and 2) reform of the relationship between the higher education and the mass public. It appears that the multi-level system is implemented in Russian higher education through a State-initiated vertical differentiation of higher education institutions based on their research and development achievements and through a concentration of resources in a limited number of leading universities. We believe that an institutional differentiation like that, with different program levels, discards some crucial points: heterogeneity in the group of leading universities that get the pre-emption right to implement Master's programs; inherent heterogeneity of individual higher education institutions that may have both high R&D potential departments and mass-market oriented ones; the danger of inhibiting the enthusiasm of universities by imposing rigid limitations on their activities, while Master's degrees remain merely a source of profit for them. We are convinced that no consistent cooperation between employers and higher education in Russia is explained by the fact that, being guided by the Bologna Process principles, higher education outstripped employers by developing educational standards long before most industries adopted their occupational standards. We have singled out four models of university activities in the context of higher education system transformation: 1) research university, 2) system integration university, 3) regional integration university, and 4) human resource construction university.","Consistent transformation; Higher education; Institutional differentiation; Multi-level education; Research universities; The Bologna Process",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027460176

The first two sections are devoted to discuss-ng epistemic, moral and political objectives of education. The last section discusses one of the most controversial topics of contemporary philosophy of education -the professional status of teachers. Ability to comprehend critically social and political conditions of formation and spread of knowledge appears to be one of the essential epistemic objectives of education. Attention towards implicit fundamentals of expert knowledge and ability to find relevant nformation to verify beliefs are epistemic virtues contributing to formation of an autonomous cognizing individual. Among ethical objectives of education, we have traditionally singled out personal autonomy, ability to live a full social and economic life, comprehensive personal development, civic (democratic) competencies, and cooperation skills. The last twenty years, largely due to feminist and communitarian criticism, have witnessed development of an attitude that consists in finding the paramount goal of education in inculcating the ideals of love, care and community spirit, instead of autonomy of a rational individual. Implicitly ethical objectives of education are closely related to ""distributive"" objectives that define the final provider of teaching efforts. Having analyzed discussions on professionalization of teachers' activities, we conclude that, although teaching is characterized by some prominent features of professional activity, its specific nature makes it difficult to establish distinct criteria of professionalization.","Epistemic objectives of education; Moral and political objectives of education; philosophy of education; Professional status of teachers",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027459776

The paper has revealed a change to teachers' pay at different educational levels in regions of Russia between 2011 and the first half of 2013. The level of teachers' pay shows a trend towards reducing inequalities and polarization in distribution of regions by personal income. At the same time, purchasing power of teachers' wage is growing more and more heterogeneous across the federal subjects of the Russian Federation. As compared to 2011-2012, when purchasing power of teachers' wage was at the same level in more than 50% of regions, the first months of 2013 witnessed an increase in the number of levels, as well as in that of regions at different levels.

An analysis of oeuvres was aimed at differentiating between formal and substantive meanings of the term ""university responsibility"". Substantive meaning of responsibility appeals to criteria beyond knowledge, appreciates the crucial importance of education effects in various aspects of life, and derives from the very fact of interdependence between the university and the society. We believe that importance of university as an institution forming the society may specifically be put into question in Russia, where the high level of education coexists weirdly with the high level of social hardship. An online questionnaire was completed by more than one third of graduates of a Russian confessional (Orthodox) university residing in more than 100 localities of Russia, former Soviet Republics, and other foreign countries. The data on graduates' shared values and attitudes obtained in the survey was compared to results of national and international surveys on family issues, civic engagement, values, employment, social capital, and consumption practices. Based on this comparison, we suggest that philosophies and attitudes of Orthodox university graduates have many common points that set them aside from the other population of Russia: they are committed to family and civic values, have a strong attitude of service, and participate in social activities to help people in need. Standardized indices of social capital in the sample of Orthodox university graduates are three times higher than those in the national sample of all higher education graduates. We propose to raise a critical discussion of the role of religion in higher education and to dwell specifically on issues of validity of theology as a scientific discipline, effects of bringing religion to high school, and the problem of confessional universities.","Confessional universities; Social capital; Social responsibility; Universities; Values",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027454022

A regression analysis has shown that only one type of combining work and studies, non-professional full-time employment, has a negative effect on academic performance. The rest of the student employment strategies haven't shown any statistically important effect on performance. All other conditions being equal, professionally employed students perform better than non-professionally employed ones, and sometimes even better than those who don't work at all.

Based on these expectations, MBA students may be classified into three categories: stable, horizontally mobile, and vertically mobile. The stable type (40%) believes that business education will give them more self-confidence and help them secure their social status and current position in the company. Horizontally mobile students (34%) expect to change their job or field of activity after graduating from the business school. Vertically-mobile students (26%) envisage a career progress, a pay rise, an improvement of social status, or getting a job in a top corporation or in an international company. The conclusion is, business education can perform different functions for different categories of students, so maximum efficiency of MBA programs may be achieved through student segmentation and educational program differentiation (more detailed elaboration of educational content to adjust it to students' demands; diversification of the set of subjects, etc.). Modern Russian business schools are rather unwilling to initiate research to study demands of both prospective students (including their status specifics, expectations, needs, and motivation for MBA studies) and employers (e. g. their requirements to successful candidates for specific positions), which blunts effectiveness of the business education system significantly.","Business-education; Expectations; MBA; Social mobility",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027440990

By definition, upbringing engages the deep-lying moral attitudes of people, the moral and cultural values that have always been disputed by the society. Upbringing inevitably involves conflicts; moreover, its social utility is hard to measure. These two factors combined, without active interference of the State, may gradually kill the upbringing practices, which is far not the best possible option for the national policy. First, in this case general education school would stop existing as a social organization. Schools with stronger educational components are more stable. Second, upbringing only forms a part of human capital. Beside cognitive skills, human capital also includes social capital and creative capital, which are the real key players in post-industrial economies. If the upbringing component of the national education system is lost, it may degrade the quality of human capital required at the next stage of national economic development. Third, Russian upbringing practices are based on a significant experience of global importance; a lot of funds have been invested to organizational and financial structure of upbringing throughout many decades. To modernize upbringing, we should tie it closely to economic and social development needs of the country.

Having analyzed statistical reports on the Russian Federation as a whole, as well as on Moscow and Krasnoyarsk Krai in particular, we created a picture of an average school principal and identified their specific features across the regions (age, gender, years of experience, competencies, etc). Upon investigation of decision-making styles (A. Rowe's Decision Style Inventory) used by school principals in Moscow and Krasnoyarsk and by award winners in the School Principal professional competition, we found out that contextual factors, personal and professional attitudes of a school principal have considerable effects on the school leadership style. The paper also gives an insight into the changes in school leadership styles in the recent decades, managerial methods used by Russian school principals, similarities and differences between school leadership practices in Russia and Canada. As it turned out, the directive decision-making style prevails in practices of both Moscow and Krasnoyarsk Krai school principals. The same style, which discourages efficient interaction between school administrators and teachers, is largely adopted by Canadian school principals even after education reforms implemented in the country. Meaningfully different results were demonstrated by the sample consisting of school principals who had won in the professional competition: about 60 % among them use the conceptual school leadership style on a regular basis. Finally, we describe the conception and design of a large-scale study of the issues in question which is scheduled for future.","Decision-making styles; Personal characteristics; Professional competencies; School leadership; School principals",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017180887

To assess how time and money investments in preparation courses affect the USE scores, we systematized results of empirical studies on the issue, analyzed the main forms of preparation courses in Russia and built a model of learning strategies followed by applicants that allows to evaluate return on investment in extra training in terms of the growth of the final USE scores. It was established that in new institutional admission conditions students use the same conventional forms of preparation to exams as before, although they had been expected to resort less to extra training after unification of the examination system. We conducted a poll among first-year students and their parents, altogether including 1,600 households in the 16 largest cities of Russia. Estimation of the modified academic performance function revealed a positive relationship between investment of money and time in preparation courses, on the one part, and results of the exam, on the other part, although the return on such investment turned out to be rather low. On the one hand, it means that USE results come from efforts applied by candidates; on the other hand, it means that students who take preparation courses may win in terms of the final results, which may bring about inequality in access to higher education. In a number of cases, the effects of school and of academic performance are more powerful than those of preparation courses. The paper formulates topics for further research: comparison of return on investment to preparation courses for students in localities with essentially different markets and tutorial opportunities (cities and towns, satellite towns, villages), analysis of learning strategies followed by students with different motivation in their choice of university, i. e. willing to earn the minimum passing score or aspiring to get high scores in order to qualify for a top-ranked university.","Learning strategies; Preparation courses; Social inequality; Tutorials; University applicants; USE",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017166078

In particular, the authors test the hypothesis that USE results in different subjects are equally efficient predictors of further student performance. Methods of regression analysis have been used to assess how preliminary examinations (both total USE points and points in specific subjects) affect academic performance in higher education. The research involved about 19,000 students enrolled at five Russian higher education institutions between 2009 and 2011. As long as the sample included institutions of different profiles, individual regressions were calculated for each faculty. A meta-analysis of regression coefficients was performed later to bring the data together. Average firstyear grade was used as the key university performance factor. It was found out that USE points were only related to performance in the second and the subsequent years through performance in the first year, i. e. indirectly. The research results allow to conclude that predictive capacity of total USE points is high enough to accept this examination as a valid student selection tool. The explained variation in university performance varies from 15 to 35% in different faculties. Predictive capacity of particular subjects making the USE total points is relatively the same, but USE points in mathematics and Russian are often the best predictors of performance.

Data was analyzed using descriptive analysis and regression analysis: influence of factors was assessed through a logistic binary choice model (logit regression).

In Russia, most professors prefer teaching over academic research, unlike in many other countries, distribution of preferences being the same for teachers at ""national research universities"" and higher education institutions with no special status. Professors who prefer academic research over teaching acquire research skills as they study and then apply efforts to get financing for their research, working more hours weekly than their teaching colleagues (average 42 vs. 38 hours per week respectively). Although faculty staff who prefer research over teaching have a higher workload and solve less routine problems in their work, they suffer much less stress and are much more satisfied with what they are doing. The conclusion thus is that distribution of professor preferences reflects peculiarities of the higher education system in the USSR and the Russian Federation, such as: focus on teaching, dissociation between science and universities, poor financing of universities as such and particularly of their academic research.","Academic research; Academic teaching staff; Job satisfaction; Occupational stress; Research universities; Teaching; Universities",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975621918

The conclusion will be that the right to participation should be considered a broader one which cannot be equated with the right to express views.

Digitized virtual monies seem ephemeral, almost ideal typical examples of money as a pure medium of exchange. This paper begins with the premise that virtual monies are as value-laden and morally entangled as any other form of money. This assertion is demonstrated by exploring how one type of virtual money, the Linden dollar (L$), and some of its associated practices are bound up with research participants’ moral categories and judgments in the virtual world of Second Life (SL). Participants’ accounts of virtual money practices are linked to moral attributes, sometimes in stark ‘good’ or ‘bad’ dichotomies, but also in more nuanced terms. These framings reproduce classifications of people and practices along a continuum with virtuousness at one end and maliciousness or harm at the other, passing through various states of possible moral dubiousness. For respondents, these two judgments go together; people are what they do with money. As a result, respondents decide what ‘people like that’ deserve. Evaluating someone’s money practices means assessing the person. Participants’ accounts of Linden dollar practices overlap with explanations of what SL is and how residents should live there. In SL, money is a form of material culture through which appropriate ways of being in the world are debated and reproduced. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Moral boundary drawing; Moralities; Second Life; Virtual economies; Virtual money; Virtual money practices; Virtual worlds",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957811531

One of the main accusations directed toward globalization is that it deepens the gap between the developed and developing countries dooming them to eternal backwardness. The article demonstrates that the actual situation is very different. It is shown that this is due to the globalization that the developing countries are generally growing much faster than the developed states, the World System core starts weakening and its periphery begins to strengthen. At the same time there is a continuing divergence between the main bulk of developing countries and the group of the poorest developing states. The article also explains why the globalization was bound to lead to the explosive rise of many developing countries and the relative weakening of the developed economies. In the forthcoming decades this trend is likely to continue (although, of course, not without certain interruptions). It is also demonstrated that this convergence constitutes a necessary condition for the next technological breakthrough. This has important implications for the hegemony debates. A rather popular theory of hegemony cycles implies that the eclipse of the global hegemony of the United States should be followed by the emergence of a new global hegemon. This generates the dichotomy of the two main current points of view-either the United States will continue the global leadership in the forthcoming decades, or it will be replaced by China in this capacity. We do not find the study of the future within this dichotomy fruitful. We believe that in a direct connection with the development of globalization processes the hegemony cycle pattern is likely to come to its end, which will lead to the World System reconfiguration and the emergence of its new structure that will allow the World System to continue its further development without a hegemon.","Balance of power; Change of the world leader; Convergence; Core; Developed countries; Developing countries; Divergence; Global hegemony; Global middle class global technological breakthrough; Globalization; Hegemony cycles; Periphery; The world system; Weakening of the USA; World order",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957552559

Improving R&D workers' remuneration is particularly urgent now in Russia given researchers' low salaries in many areas of science (particularly considering the complexity of their work). To address the problem of compensation for researchers, new policy measures have been adopted since 2012. This paper presents new evidence from Russia's scientific community - researchers, managers of R&D organisations, and government representatives - collected via a survey and focus group discussions on the desirability and efficiency of the current remuneration policy. Although most members of Russia's scientific community do not question the necessity and relevance of the government's 'efficient contract' initiative in the R&D sector, its implementation has had a more mixed response.

The basic example of such a manifold is a twistor space of a hyperkähler or a 4-dimensional anti-selfdual Riemannian manifold X (not necessarily compact). We prove “a holography principle” for such a manifold: any meromorphic function defined in a neighbourhood U of S can be extended to M, and any section of a holomorphic line bundle can be extended from U to M. This is used to define the notion of a Moishezon twistor space: this is a twistor space admitting a holomorphic embedding to a Moishezon variety Mʹ. We show that this property is local on X, and the variety Mʹ is unique up to birational transform. We prove that the twistor spaces of hyperkähler manifolds obtained by hyperkähler reduction of flat quaternionic-Hermitian spaces by the action of reductive Lie groups (such as Nakajima’s quiver varieties) are always Moishezon. © 2014, International Press of Boston, Inc.

We find that privatization and the choice of privatization option have no effect on the long-term survival of firms in Russia, but that managerial ownership lowers the likelihood of both liquidation and bankruptcy. Other transition-specific predictors of bankruptcy, such as the extent of price controls and the amount of wage arrears, affect firm exit in a significant way.","Bankruptcy; Liquidation; Ownership structure; Privatization; Russia; Survival analysis",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927604414

The authors inquire which of these RTOs are successfully competing for public funding, and how these funds are used. Also, the authors study what makes an RTO more (financially) successful in technology transfer than their peers and which RTOs transferred technology that was new to the Russian market. Design/methodology/approach – This research is based on 62 RTOs which reported technology transfer to enterprises with main economic activities classified by NACE rev 1 as “A – agriculture, hunting and forestry” and “B – fishing” and “C – mining and quarrying,” including oil and gas extraction. Findings – The authors found remarkable differences between the Russian RTOs and their OECD peers, but also differences between agriculture and mining. Interestingly, competitive funding plays a different role in both industries. In agriculture, a more conservative funding paradigm prevails, and competitive funding is less important and more reliance on classical annually revolving funds is given. Competitive funding here is more used to strengthen basic R&D and to generate patentable knowledge, while in mining, these funds support technology transfer. Originality/value – This is, to the knowledge, the first detailed study on Russian RTOs servicing her primary sector. The authors believe that studying these RTOs is of great value as RTOs are broadly under-researched and various scholars have called for more fine-grained analyses to better understand their role in the innovation system. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Primary sector; Research and development; Research and development organization; Russia",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926371162

He understands spirit as one of several naturally functioning human mental agencies, such as consciousness, will, memory, etc. That is, he treats the mental agency of spirit in a scientific way and avoids any esoteric or religious connotations that this peculiar term may involve. The nature of human spirit, according to Scheler, is the ability to withstand and deliberately redirect biological imperatives and instinctive drives, up to the point of purposefully throwing away one’s own life. The presence of spirit constitutes the essence of the human being that differentiates him qualitatively from all animals. In this article, I argue that it is human spirit that plays the determinative role in causing heroic and self-sacrificial behavior. I also argue that the individual human spirit experiences its inherent development, thus having several rather dissimilar stages and manifestations. I discuss the meaning that the term ‘spirit’ has in the English and the American philosophical and psychological traditions and the meaning of the corresponding term ‘der Geist’ in the German traditions. The specific English-language understanding of the term ‘spirit’, compared to its German counterpart ‘der Geist’, namely, less scientific and more religious and esoteric and metaphorical for the former, makes it alien and almost unusable in the English and American traditions. The linguistic difference leads to the misunderstanding of some very important ideas brought by the concept of spirit as introduced by Scheler. My purpose is to overcome this discrepancy and omission and to introduce the notion and the concept of spirit, in their scientific understanding, into the arsenal of modern English-language cognitive science, psychology, and philosophy in order to provide for the full explanatory force of the hitherto neglected concept of spirit. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Evolutionary psychology; Heroism; Max Scheler; Moral psychology; Philosophical anthropology; Political behavior; Political psychology; Self-sacrificial behavior; Spirit; Terrorism","altruism; ego; Germany; history; human; politics; psychological model; psychology; war; Altruism; Ego; Germany; History, 19th Century; History, 20th Century; Humans; Models, Psychological; Politics; Psychology; War","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926242869

This is one of the clear reasons why the concept of Smart Cities recently attracted a great amount of attention, both from academia and city planners. One of the challenges of the Smart City concept is how to raise human capital among people, such as making them culturally sensitive, mobile and to improve other social characteristics. This challenge is especially valid for industrial cities that are facing economic turbulence and a demand for revitalizing their public spaces and economic specialties. The aim of this study is to examine the correlation between the amount of international students in Russian universities with the positive changes that occur in a Russian student's human capital, and their neighbourhood areas, especially in public spaces. We aim to support the hypothesis that a network of ""internationalized"" universities serves as a revitalization measure for a city, facilitating the development of its surrounding areas, and reducing political and social risks within a society. Research methods for gathering data are: deductive trend search, which uses a literature review from leading academic journals and the empirical study based on the created questionnaire. This questionnaire forms a dataset which consists of a number of master courses held in English from one of the leading Russian universities based in Moscow.

One of the reasons is the diversity of models and institutional contexts in which business incubators act.

The concept of Russia as the great power was changing during this time in two respects: first, there was an increasing reticence of self-assessments; second, we observe prioritization of protecting the country's own, mostly regional, interests as opposed to expansion which would be characteristic of a great power. Moreover, this period clearly demonstrates contradictions and dangers, engendered in the process of losing self-perception as that of the great power. The readiness of Russian political elite to part bit by bit with the status of the great power and to go to the status of a regional power is combined (as the events around Ukraine have shown) with unwillingness to sustain the new status of the country with the help of the capabilities of a soft power. Lack of these, as well as of the skills in their use, and finally, a desire to raise the rating of trust in the government with the help of ""a small victorious war"" have formed the basis for the aggressive upsurge towards Ukraine. In the absence of serious hard and soft capabilities, the splashes of aggressiveness in Russian foreign policy and of anti-Western sentiments in domestic political life are unlikely to have any lasting effect. They are able, however, to generate extremely negative long-term consequences for the country. © 2014 The Regents of the University of California.","Greatpowerness; Hard power; Resources/capabilities; Russia; Set of images; Set of roles; Soft power; Status",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919490116

Except for revolving loans, it is known in advance, it is the current balance (principal amount plus accrued interests) of the loan. Finally, there is a third parameter that defines the expected losses.

This task is formulated in terms of computer vision approach as a moving object detection in noisy environment. It is shown that the state-of-the-art local descriptors (SURF, SIFT, FAST, ORB) are not characterized with satisfactory detection quality if the camera resolution is low, the lighting is changed dramatically and shadows are observed. In this paper we propose to use a simple mathematical morphological algorithm to detect the presence of a cargo on the forklift truck. Its first step is the estimation of the movement direction and the front part of the truck by using the updating motion history image. The second step is the application of Canny contour detection and binary morphological operations in front of the moving object to estimate simple geometric features of empty forklift. The algorithm is implemented with the OpenCV library. Our experimental study shows that the best results are achieved if the difference of the width of bounding rectangles is used as a feature. Namely, the detection accuracy is 78.7 % (compare with 40 % achieved by the best local descriptor), while the average frame processing time is only 5 ms (compare with 35 ms for the fastest descriptor). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Binary morphology; Canny operator; Forklifttruck detection; Motion history image; Noisy environment; Object detection; SURF; Video-based recognition","Algorithms; Computer vision; Estimation; Materials handling equipment; Motion estimation; Object recognition; Trucks; Binary morphology; Canny Operators; Motion history images; Noisy environment; Object Detection; SURF; Video-based recognition; Mathematical morphology","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84916212128

While there is substantial literature devoted to disproving AIDS-denialist views, there is a lack of studies exploring AIDS-denialists online communities that interact with an external environment. Objective: We explored three research areas: (1) reasons for newcomers to come to an AIDS-denialist community, (2) the patterns of interactions of the community with the newcomers, and (3) rhetorical strategies that denialists use for persuasion in the veracity of their views. Methods: We studied the largest AIDS-denialist community on one of the most popular social networking services in Russia. We used netnography as a method for collecting data for qualitative analysis and observed the community for 9 months (at least 2-3 times a week). While doing netnography, we periodically downloaded community discussions. In total, we downloaded 4821 posts and comments for analysis. Grounded theory approach was used for data analysis. Results: Most users came to the community for the following reasons: their stories did not fit the unitary picture of AIDS disease progression translated by popular medical discourse, health problems, concern about HIV-positive tests, and desire to dissuade community members from false AIDS beliefs. On the basis of strength in AIDS-denialist beliefs, we constructed a typology of the newcomers consisting of three ideal-typical groups: (1) convinced: those who already had become denialists before coming to the group, (2) doubters: those who were undecided about the truth of either human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) science theory or AIDS-denialist theory, and (3) orthodox: those who openly held HIV science views. Reception of a newcomer mainly depended on the newcomer's belief status. Reception was very warm for the convinced, cold or slightly hostile for the doubters, and extremely hostile or derisive for the orthodox. We identified seven main rhetorical strategies of persuasion used by the denialists on the ""undecided"". Conclusions: Contrary to the widespread public health depiction of AIDS denialists as totally irrational, our study suggests that some of those who become AIDS denialists have sufficiently reasonable grounds to suspect that ""something is wrong"" with scientific theory, because their personal experience contradicts the unitary picture of AIDS disease progression. Odd and inexplicable practices of some AIDS centers only fuel these people's suspicions. We can conclude that public health practitioners' practices may play a role in generating AIDS-denialist sentiments. In interactions with the newcomers, the experienced community members highlighted the importance of personal autonomy and freedom of choice in decision making consistent with the consumerist ideology of health care. The study findings suggest that health care workers should change a one-size-fits-all mode of counseling for a more complex and patient-tailored approach, allowing for diversity of disease progression scenarios and scientific uncertainty. ©Peter Meylakhs, Yuri Rykov, Olessia Koltsova, Sergey Koltsov.","Aids denialists; Consumer health information; Internet; Netnography; Online communities; Qualitative research; Quality of health information on the internet","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; consumer health information; denial; human; information seeking; persuasive communication; psychology; Russian Federation; social media; social network; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Consumer Health Information; Denial (Psychology); Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Persuasive Communication; Russia; Social Media; Social Networking","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84914687962

Scientific capital is a well-known concept for measuring and assessing the accumulated recognition and the specific scientific power. The concept of scientific capital developed by Bourdieu is used in international social science research to explain a set of scholarly properties and practices. Mathematical modeling is applied as a lens through which the scientific capital is addressed. The principal contribution of this paper is an axiomatic characterization of scientific capital in terms of natural axioms. The application of the axiomatic method to scientific capital reveals novel insights into problem still not covered by mathematical modeling. Proposed model embraces the interrelations between separate sociological variables, providing a unified sociological view of science. Suggested microvariational principle is based upon postulate, which affirms that (under suitable conditions) the observed state of the agent in scientific field maximizes scientific capital. Its value can be roughly imagined as a volume of social differences. According to the considered macrovariational principle, the actual state of scientific field makes so-called energy functional (which is associated with the distribution of scientific capital) minimal. © 2014 Yurij L.

Values were measured by Schwartz’s questionnaire as well as Inglehart’s Self-Expression items. Cross-classified multilevel regression models were applied to the sample of migrants, selected from five rounds of the European Social Survey. The results demonstrated the significance of both the country of residence and the country of birth as well as values, which are common in these countries. Surprisingly, the association of migrants’ values with the country of residence appeared to be higher than the one of country of birth. Furthermore, migrants’ values better correspond to values that are common in the country of residence than values widespread in the country of birth. Assuming that value-based self-selection of migrants is negligible, the results support the idea that basic values are subject to change over an individual life span and not only during one’s formative years. © The Author(s) 2014.","basic values; cross-classified multilevel model; European Social Survey; intra-European migrants; value adaptation; value change",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910048666

Experiments performed with mobile robots are described. These experiments demonstrate a set of various types of robots’ behavior: melancholic, choleric, sanguine, and phlegmatic. All these types were implemented using the so-called temperament controller, which determines a balance between the excitation and inhibition parameters of the robot control system. An FSM-based model of temperament is also proposed that makes it possible to describe the behavior of an individual.

Selected fragments are divided into collocations of fixed size and added to a special list. The report document is also divided into fragments, which are compared with important fragments of technical documentation using selected collocation list. Every fragment of the report gets measure of similarity during the comparison. The measure helps evaluating the amount of the useful data in each paragraph.

The described method of visualization allows the expert to determine, if the considered report can be either easily rejected because of lack of useful information, or can be used for closer examination.

Business models of software distribution are constantly evolving as new technologies develop. Traditional retail versions of software products are mostly replaced with digital distribution of copies of software products. However, these ways of software distribution are by no means exhaustive. Functionality of software is not necessarily tied with provision of the copy of the relevant program to the user. Instead he can receive access to it via the Internet without the need to install software onto his computer. This type of business model received the name ""Software-as-a-Service"" (SaaS) or, sometimes ""Cloud Computing"". The legal nature of relations arising between the user and provider of distant access to such software is subject to considerable debate in Russia. The main problem is that at first glance it resembles the features of various types of contracts, recognized in the Civil Code of Russia, although not falling completely within any of them. At the same time the type of agreement chosen by the parties defines the legal framework, which governs relevant relations and relevant tax consequences. This article aims to analyze the nature of existing relations between the user and SaaS-provider and to define whether it can be characterized as a license, service, lease or some kind of sui generis contract. Based on the analysis the author comes to a conclusion that as delivery of copies of software becomes less and less relevant for the software industry, due to the new business models implemented by vendors, the rights to use the particular copy of software around which the traditional copyright regime has been built, become more and more superseded with the right to access such software. Thus traditional contractual models developed for IP distribution (license agreements, assignment agreements) and, more generally, the legal framework of existing copyright law that is centered on the core idea of the ""use"" of the copy, are no longer adequate regulators in the digital era where remote access to objects of copyright will soon start to dominate. © 2014 Alexander Savelyev.","Software as a service Software copyright Software licensing Application service provider","Copyright law; Software licensing; Software-as-a-Service","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908239043

Our contribution is focused on the development of general equilibrium theorizing in the work of Victor Meerovich Polterovich (b. 1937), who has been one of the leading figures in mathematical economics and general equilibrium theory in the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia. His papers on the abstract models of exchange, dynamic general equilibrium and optimal growth theory, excess demand correspondences, monotonicity of demand functions, and disequilibrium theory were for the most part published in English and gained considerable attention within the field. We reconstruct the political and ideological basis of the general equilibrium concept and show how abstract mathematical models reflected the discursive shift from optimal centralized planning to various forms of decentralization.

The Russian case results in unsuccessful and unsustainable repatriation, the German case exhibits a change from sustainable repatriation to a slow termination of the program, while the case of Kazakhstan is one of sustainable and relatively successful repatriation. The main argument of the paper is that in order for a repatriation program to be sustainable, the program must contain both a practical component and an ideological component. If a repatriation program lacks ideological backing which permeates other aspects of political life in a state, then the repatriation program grinds to a halt. If a repatriation program has ideological backing, but is rendered impractical and does not meet the economic, demographic and labor market needs of a state, then the further development of the program stops.

The query image is recognized by matching its descriptors with the descriptors of reference images. The matching is usually done by summation of distances between descriptors of corresponding blocks. Unfortunately, such approach does not lead to a correct distance between vector of points (histograms of each block) if popular square of Euclidean distance is used as a discrimination.

According to Isidore, justice (iustitia) is related to the written law (ius); this word is primarily used with reference to mundane justice and legislation. In the same time it may be a just legal order, established by God, and in this sense iustitia is partly associated with aequitas. On the contrary, an equity (aequitas) is based on natural law (ius naturale) and signifies the primordial order, natural and obvious to everyone. It's main feature is equality of all the people. Nevertheless (even in the same Isidore's works) the concepts of aequitas and iustitia look like interchangeable synonyms: the original distinction between them disappears little by little, as long as God is accepted to be an ultimate source for both iustitia and aequitas and a passage in the ""Differences"" I.32 (68) appears a mere scholastic exercise in distinguishing the concepts which no longer differ in practice.","Aequitas; Human and divine justice; Isidore of Seville; Iustitia; Reception of the Roman legal tradition",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905406102

It argues that sovereignty often is used as a powerful argument which allows the setting aside of international humanitarian standards and the formal constitutional guarantees of human rights. This conflict between sovereignty and human rights also recurs in other countries, and many legal scholars are demanding the revision or even abandonment of the concept of sovereignty. In Russia, this conflict is aggravated by some characteristic features of the traditional mentality frequently favoring statism and collective interests over individual ones, and by the state building a 'power vertical' subordinating regional and other particularistic interests to the central power. These features and policies are studied in the context of the Slavophile-Westernizer philosophical divide. This divide reveals the pros and contras put forward by the Russian supporters of the isolationist (conservative) policy throughout contemporary history-especially in the sovereignty debates in recent years. The 1993 Russian Constitution contains many declaratory statements about human rights and democracy, but their formulations are vague and, thus far, have had little concrete effect in court battles where the application of international humanitarian law from time to time has been counterbalanced by the concerns of the protection of sovereignty. These concerns coincide with isolationist and authoritarian policies, which in 2006 led to their amalgamation in the concept of 'sovereign democracy'. This concept is considered in this article to be a recurrence of the Russian conservative tradition. Even though the concept in its literal meaning has been abandoned by its author and supporters, most of its ideas remain on the cusp of the official political discourse which reproduces the pivotal axes of Russian political philosophy of the XIX century. © Copyright 2014 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","democracy; human rights; individual liberties; international law; legal mentality; Russian Constitutional Court; Slavophiles; sovereignty; Westernizers",,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905400487

Until now, however, insights into the importance of environmental management of oil and gas producers are very limited. We studied the annual reports and environmental reports of the six most prominent industry actors between 2008 and 2010 and analyze their changing approaches to green management.

Universities have been known to create a stimulating context for generations to share and acquire skills. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of research in the field of intergenerational learning and skills sharing. The topic is important as the ideas of teacher-student (T-S) and teacher-teacher (T-T) collaboration based on the principles of interdependence and reciprocity between generations have become acute in the era of the information society when the generation gap is widening. Learning Management System (LMS) projects are believed to enforce human development and collaboration of adults and young learners in universities. The paper dwells upon the importance of needing to be aware of peculiarities of human development in applying IGL policies to education. Better understanding of such internal psychological factors as motivation, creativity and intelligence will allow the level of generation integration and knowledge creation to rise. The paper proposes the idea that LMS training sessions and LMS products as a virtual platform can be effective tools for intergenerational learning collaborations. In this paper we are mainly interested in presenting the results of the projects aimed at increasing ICT competence of teachers.

One of them consisted of the futuristic essay, Resurrection of the Word, first presented in December, 1913, and devoted to the problem of the death and resurrection of literature through the use of transrational language (in Russian ZAUM, i. e. beyond, or trans-sense). Another book, entitled The Saturnine Fate, concerned archaic prose poetry devoted to the war that had just begun. Šklovskij borrows an official military rhetoric and changes its accents, turning it into an instrument of pacifism. It should be stressed that 1914 was the same year the new Formalist theory started growing, reaching a first intellectual peak in 1916 when the key Šklovskij essay, Art as Device, was published. At the same time, Šklovskij had been drafted into the army, and war became a fruitful background for this emerging theory. Šklovskij first served as an instructor in the armored car division; following the February 1917 bourgeois revolution he was actively involved in agitation for the Provisional Government as a commissar, first on the Western front, then later on the Southern front. After the Russian bourgeois revolution of 1917, as events grew out of control, the explosion of history required simultaneous reflection. Šklovskij began writing memoirs long before he reached old age, based on his own conception of the genre. A war depicted in a book with the intertextual title Sentimental Journey is reconstructed here as a mechanism paralleled principally with the automobile; a means of transport to be handled with care. In the first part of the book, the war is seen as having a specific order of things, as opposed to a revolution which follows more the path of chaos. However, throughout his journey, Šklovskij observes the logic of events and concludes that the processes of war and revolution do not stand opposed, but instead have a consequential relationship. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Constructing the biography; Russian Formalism; Russian Revolution; Theory of literature; World War I",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903750234

The Russian philosopher Vladimir Ern (1882-1917) in his article ""From Kant to Krupp"" (1914) attempted ""to ground"" the hostility between Russia and its allies, on the one hand, and Germany, on the other hand. This attempt turned Ern's article into one of the earliest manifestoes of cultural racism in Russia, maybe the very first one. Discussing this article in the context of other works by Ern of 1910-1917, one can see that Ern applied Friedrich Nietzsche's genealogical method for the political interpretation of ""the problem of technology"" causing the aggressive approach to the human's environment. Nevertheless, Ern's cultural racism and aggressive rhetoric blocked further development and even reception of his methodological innovations. The psychological compensatory pragmatic of his rhetoric seems to resemble the analogical function of rigid opposition between ""Russia"" and ""West"" in speeches of contemporary Russia's official ideologues. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cultural racism; First World War; French Germanophobia; German anti-Semitism; Russian Germanophobia; Russian philosophy of 20th century; Vladimir Ern",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903736216

As soon as we try to apply to consciousness subject-object schemes, then we immediately come across paradoxes.

It proposes an analysis of party cadres' conceptualization of culture that provided the basis for the creation of the state monopoly on cultural production of the young Soviet regime in the early 1920s. Particular attention is given to Lenin's differentiation between ""bureaucratic"" and ""cultural"" motivations to labour that, after the October Revolution of 1917, allowed to substantiate the shift in the point of view on socialism from a political to a cultural one. The building of the new Soviet statehood required a moderate depoliticization, the renunciation of the radical revolutionary rhetoric of class struggle in internal policy and the reinterpretation of class, social and cultural contradictions. Attention is drawn to the importance of cultural debates for the creation of the unique Soviet mechanism of governance that separated the principal ideological role of the party from the operative administration of the state machinery. At the centre of the analysis there will be no ""theories"" of culture or doctrinal diversity of Marxist-Leninist approaches but there will be the modes of culture's problematization within the sphere that was defined by Michel Foucault as gouvernementalité.

State-of-the-art batch-mode adaptation algorithms assume that speech of particular speaker contains enough information about the user's voice. In this article we propose to allow the user to manually verify if the adaptation is useful. Our procedure requires the speaker to pronounce syllables containing each vowel of particular language. The algorithm contains two steps looping through all syllables. At first, LPC analysis is performed for extracted vowel and the LPC coefficients are used to synthesize the new sound (with a fixed pitch period) and play it. If this synthesized sound is not perceived by the user as an original one then the syllable should be recorded again. At the second stage, speaker is asked to produce another syllable with the same vowel to automatically verify the stability of pronunciation. If two signals are closed (in terms of the Itakura-Saito divergence) then the sounds are marked as ""good"" for adaptation. Otherwise both steps are repeated. In the experiment we examine a problem of vowel recognition for Russian language in our voice control system which fuses two classifiers: the CMU Sphinx with speaker-independent acoustic model and Euclidean comparison of MFCC features of model vowel and input signal frames. Our results support the statement that the proposed approach provides better accuracy and reliability in comparison with traditional MAP/MLLR techniques implemented in the CMU Sphinx. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.","Automatic speech recognition; CMU Sphinx; linear autoregression model; phoneme recognition; speaker adaptation; voice control","Linguistics; Quality control; Regression analysis; Signal processing; Automatic speech recognition; Autoregression models; CMU Sphinx; Phoneme recognition; Speaker adaptation; Voice control; Speech recognition","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903650313

This paper discusses the potential of patent analysis and surveys the Russian biotechnological market with both quantitative and qualitative methods. It reviews key statistical and analytical findings of empirical research. The main finding is that the Russian biotechnological market has a relatively high level of dependence on foreign technologies: among biotechnological patents published in Russia in 2012, a third was granted to non-residents. In Russia, foreigners are active in patenting universal methods and techniques useful for biotechnological advancement. This may constrain future Russian organizations' access to results and methods and therefore block some directions of biotechnological research within the country. Among other challenges, are the following: a low involvement of the Russian commercial sector in developing biotechnologies, a lack of cooperation between the segments of the market, and a disadvantaged position of some subfields, such as eco- and aqua biotechnologies and bioenergy. By using patent data, we identify active actors contributing most significantly to progress of biotechnologies in Russia, and we focus on dynamically developing subfields, such as biomedicine and pharmaceuticals.","Biotechnologies; Genetic engineering; Patent activity; Patent analysis; Patent classification",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902509933

A string-to-text relevance score, based on annotated suffix trees, is used several times to 1) clear the Wikipedia data from noise; 2) to assign Wikipedia categories to taxonomy topics; 3) to choose whether the category should be assigned to the taxonomy topic or stay on intermediate levels. The resulting taxonomy consists of three parts: the manully set upper levels, the adopted Wikipedia category tree and the Wikipedia articles as leaves.

Imagine, each alternative is described with an interval [l, u], and one alternative dominates another if and only if intervals do not overlap and lower bound of the first interval is greater than upper bound of the second interval. Preferences with such property may occur in the cases, when applicants' scoring system (interview, exam or sum of points) is not exactly accurate. In the previous paper we have shown the existence of a stable matching and provided the criteria of applicant Pareto-optimality of a stable matching, based on Stable Improvement Cycles. However, the Pareto-efficient stable mechanism is not (in general) strategy-proof for applicants. We provide a strategy-proof applicant-proposing deferred acceptance with tie-breaking, where tie-breaking procedure is organized in a special way. This special tie-breaking allows to lower chances of an applicant-inefficient stable matching (in comparison to that with random-tie breaking). © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Interval orders; Matching model; Pareto-efficiency; Stable matching","Pareto principle; Interval orders; Matching models; Pareto efficiency; Pareto-optimality; Preference relation; Stable matching; Strategy-proofness; Two sided matching; Commerce","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902239716

Drawing on semi-structured interviews focused on motives, the paper argues that some respondents found in volunteer work a way of regaining meaning, structure and belonging after experiences of social dislocation such as retirement and bereavement. The transition from social dislocation to ontological security via volunteering illustrates the way in which 'the social' - as expressed in fellowship, laughter, work, organizations and institutions - moderates charitable practice. From this perspective, volunteering appears as a relational, processual and affective practice of care; and as a sympathy catalyst - an institution that facilitates interpersonal sympathy exchanges and support for compassionate goals. The paper endorses a view of human subjectivity which takes seriously both human vulnerability and resilience - victimhood and agency - as well as the relevance of suffering and flourishing for social action. In so doing, the paper sheds light on the link between individual biographies and the institutionalized efforts to alleviate strangers' suffering that Natan Sznaider has termed 'public compassion'. © 2013 The Editorial Board of The Sociological Review.","Lay normativity; Mattering; Morality; Prosocial behaviour; Relationality; Solidarity; Suffering; Sympathy",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901828011

The purpose of these studies was to inform policymakers about the real economic burden of risky behaviors and to provide conditions for evidence-based and well-informed decision making in this area. Methods: The cost-of-illness method was applied to estimate the social cost of substance abuse. The intangible cost was not included in estimation. A prevalence-based approach was applied to estimate the tangible cost. For the estimation of direct costs, a top-down method was used. Indirect costs were estimated using two methods: the human capital and the friction cost. Results: In 2008, the social cost of substance abuse in Russia comprised 677.2 billion rubles if the friction cost method is applied and 1965.9 billion rubles if the human capital method is used. The social cost of substance abuse is defined to the greatest extent by alcohol consumption, comprising about 45% of the economic burden. Illicit drug use comprises about 30% of the economic burden and tobacco consumption 25%. Conclusions: The results of economic studies demonstrated that psychoactive substances impose a considerable economic burden on society. Analysis of the substance abuse social cost pattern shows that the main losses that society bears because of these behavioral risk factors fall outside the health care system and lay in other sectors of the economy such as social care, law enforcement, and productivity losses. © 2014 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).","Alcohol; Illicit drugs; Social cost; Substance abuse; Tobacco","illicit drug; illicit drug; psychotropic agent; alcohol abuse; article; controlled study; cost of illness; decision making; evidence based medicine; high risk behavior; human; policy; prevalence; priority journal; Russian Federation; social aspect; social cost; substance abuse; tobacco dependence; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; Article; cost; disability; drug dependence; economic aspect; fire; friction cost; health care cost; health care policy; health care system; health education; human capital cost; law enforcement; medical decision making; medical research; mortality; orphaned child; productivity; public health service; risk factor; smoking; social behavior; social care; substance abuse; tobacco dependence; traffic accident","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900001564

The approaches to project evaluation in the field of project management were investigated, and the main steps of traditional project evaluation process were determined. The most commonly applied steps of foresight evaluation were identified by the analysis of recent foresight evaluation projects. The comparison of evaluation frameworks for foresight projects and traditional projects allows to provide recommendations for foresight evaluation framework improvement. Findings: The paper identifies several lessons for foresight evaluation from project management. The elements which can enrich foresight evaluation framework are the following: the development of an evaluation model; the extensive use of quantitative methods; the elaboration of evaluation scales; the inclusion of economic indicators into evaluation; and the provision of more openness and transparency for evaluation results.

No goods are ambiguous by default, not even digital virtual ones. Ambiguity may arise in many ways, but this article examines one specific process: ambiguity that occurs when entities appear as objects that blur category boundaries. Ambiguity is created around pre-existing categories through socio-material entanglements. This article explores how a central category in consumer capitalist societies-property-takes on ambiguous forms in distributions and recirculations of prestige items in the massively multi-player online role-playing game Final Fantasy XI. Prestige objects are powerful, sought-after armour and weapons acquired in the game world by completing difficult battlefields or tasks, often in large groups. When discussing these items, respondents are not confused actors trying to make sense of slippery things. Instead, they produce ambiguities around property by blurring distinctions between gifts and commodities. Blurred boundaries help resolve tensions arising from different orderings of people, relations and things. Hybridised property forms allow selective alienation of goods, allowing participants to privilege some relations and connections over others. With this article, I hope to spark further debate on building a conceptual toolkit to explore ambiguities, and contribute to increasing interest in non-dyadic gift relations in consumer culture research.

If the regime gets more authoritarian the oppositional party can still be a tool to win a local election. But after being elected, the winner finds himself in another political environment of existing patron-client relations, and has no other choice than to become a dependent member, or an agent (according to principal-agent theory) in higher-level clientele.

This focus is put forward as an effective way of philosophically elaborating what are argued to be the twin aspects of the statement—the being that transcends predication, and an irreducibly first person ontology. This elaboration is performed by discussing the way in which these two themes have been approached at certain pertinent points in the history of metaphysics. With regard to the theme of transcendent being, an overview of the medieval Scholastic debates on the issue precedes a direct discussion of the Heideggerian position. As for the theme of the irreducibility of first person ontology, an overview of the relevant theories of the various German Idealist philosophers precedes a direct engagement with what Heidegger has to say on this issue. The overall argument here is that it is possible coherently to conceive of the pure being that transcends all entities in terms of the ‘I’ of an absolute subject without eliding the difference between being and entities, without succumbing to what Heidegger regards as an onto-theological oblivion of being. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Being; Exodus 3:14; German Idealism; Heidegger; Scholasticism; Subjectivity; The absolute",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893856623

It is demonstrated that these complex psychological phenomena can be imitated by very simple means. At the heart of the emotional component of the robot's architecture is Simonov's Information Theory of Emotions. The main assumption of this theory is that emotions represent the brain's estimate of any actual need of the individual together with the probability of its satisfaction. The temperamental component of the model controls the balance of excitation and inhibition within the robot's cognitive architecture. Experiments were conducted with a couple of simple mobile autonomous robots. Experimental results demonstrate distinct types of behavioral temperament exhibited by the robot, including melancholic, choleric, sanguine and phlegmatic. These types of behavior are determined by ""regulators of temperament"" in the robot architecture. It is shown that emotions and temperament can be very useful for a robot in complex environments with unknown characteristics. Various in character environments can demand various types of behavior: in quickly changing environments the choleric behavior is more preferable and in stationary ones are phlegmatic, etc. In some sense, different psychological organization of a robot can be considered as a convenient mechanism of adaptation. Emotions and temperament as biologically inspired mechanisms allow us not only to describe but also to control the robot's behavior in a natural form. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

On one hand, the Russian political elite needs economic growth to keep social stability in the country and to limit mass protesting in big cities. Economic growth is impossible without investment, which explains Russian leaders' increased interest in improving Russia's business climate. On the other hand, influential interest groups (represented first of all by security and law enforcement agencies) try to expand their control on rent sources in the economy. These groups of interests could strengthen their positions due to fear of political protests. This strong conflict among different groups in the Russian elite creates additional uncertainty for investors and the business community, and can lead to economic recession independent of the level of oil prices and dynamics of global markets. Reversing these negative trends in economic development will be possible only with collective actions of different economic and political actors (including technocrats in federal and regional governments, representatives of large and successful middle-sized business and top-managers of public sector organizations) in the search for pragmatic solutions to the challenges faced by Russian economy and society. © 2013 Asia-Pacific Research Center, Hanyang University.","Bureaucracy; Investment climate; Modernization from above; Rents; Response to the crises; Russian transition economy; Violent pressure on business",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890858321

The first section explicates my conception of culture - a conception of the normative value system that underlies social practices and institutions. I then derive seven value orientations that are useful for describing and comparing societies. Next, the chapter discusses the conceptual underpinnings for measuring the cultural value orientations. It then presents the survey methods developed for this purpose, and the empirical validation of the content of the value orientations and of the structure of relations among them. This is based on analyses of data across 77 national groups in 75 countries. Brief comparisons of these value orientations with two other dimensional approaches to culture are followed by an analysis that justifies treating countries as cultural units. The middle section of the chapter uses the seven validated cultural orientations to generate a worldwide graphic mapping of national cultures. This map permits comparison of national cultures with one another on each orientation. It reveals eight distinct world cultural regions that reflect the influence of geographic proximity, history, language, and other factors. To illustrate the meaningfulness of the cultural map, I discuss the distinctive cultural profiles of each world cultural region. The final third of the chapter examines associations between culture, measured by the value orientations, and a variety of variables of economic significance: the socioeconomic level of countries, their level of corruption, the social net they provide to citizens, their level of democracy, and the competitiveness of their market systems. It discusses the reciprocal causal processes that may account for these associations. Finally, the chapter analyzes how distance between countries on cultural value orientations affects the flow of investment around the world. The current approach differs from well-known theories of cultural dimensions (e.g. Inglehart and Baker, 2000; Hofstede, 2001) in deriving the constructs to measure culture from a priori theorizing and then testing the fit of these constructs to empirical data. Moreover, whereas other approaches seek orthogonal dimensions, I assume that correlated dimensions capture culture better because they can express the interdependence of cultural elements. My theory of culture specifies a coherent, integrated system of relations among the seven cultural orientations. These orientations form three correlated bipolar dimensions. Empirical measures of the seven orientations support the coherence of culture by revealing that the cultural profiles of societies rarely exhibit incompatible value emphases. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Cultural value orientations; Implications of national cultures for economics; Mapping 75 national cultures",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884130538

We divided TIMSS participants into 6 groups from the top performers to poor performers (based on class average PVs in math) and picked up 10 (and 20) hardest PISA items using One-Parameter Rasch Model. Then we checked the proportion of correctly done PISA items among the 10 (and 20) hardest ones in each TIMSS group of students. This indicator is measure of the ability to transfer subject knowledge in a new context and apply them to solve real-life problems. Positive relationship between the level of subject knowledge development and the ability to transfer and apply it to a every-day problems was found. The better student knows math, the more likely he will be able to apply this knowledge to solve problems in a non-academic context. This relationship is not linear.

We have analyzed the key teacher belief research projects: the OECD's Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), the cross-cultural Teacher Education and Development Study in Mathematics (TEDS-M), and the Nordic-Baltic Comparative Research in Mathematics Education (NorBA) that we borrowed a questionnaire from. Our survey involved teachers of mathematics in three countries: 390 teachers in Latvia (of which 95 with Russian as their native tongue), 332 teachers in Estonia (of which 92 with Russian as their native tongue), and 1,096 teachers in the Russian Federation. We have found that differences between teachers in different countries were statistically important in all the variables used in the study, regardless of whether Estonian and Latvian teachers were Russian-speaking or not. All teachers implemented their beliefs in their everyday classroom practices. 36% of teachers in Russia had a high level of constructivism (as compared to 26% in Latvia and 18% in Estonia). Proportion of teachers with low levels of traditionalism in Latvia and Estonia (appr. 25% in both) was higher than the same proportion among Russian teachers (17.5%). We have come to a conclusion that different approaches to education system reforms in Russia and in the Baltic states have resulted in a significant diversity of beliefs among teachers of mathematics. Thus, proportion of teachers with low levels of traditionalist beliefs has grown in the Baltic countries more than in Russia, which explains to some extent higher PISA points of Estonian and Latvian students.","Beliefs; Constructivism; Mathematics teachers; Nordic-Baltic Comparative Research in Mathematics Education; PISA; School education; Traditionalism",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027442714

The fundamental idea lying behind the proposed assessment tool is that, having necessary data at hand, one can identify empirically stable correlations between student performance and contextual factors (e. g. different social composition of students). In research practice, these correlations were revealed through multiple regression analysis. Results of such analysis-established empirical correlations-may then be used to ""discount"" formal progress, i. e. to have justifiably higher expectations about institutions in more favorable contexts and lower expectations about those in less favorable situations. The authors think over two ways of using this information: based either on a formula or on a specific index (the index of school social well-being) they have elaborated.

Alice has a binary string x and Bob a binary string y, both of length n, and they want to compute or approximate Kolmogorov complexity C(x|y) of x conditional to y. It is easy to show that deterministic communication complexity of approximating C(x|y) with additive error α is at least n∈-∈2α∈-∈O(1). The above referenced paper asks what is randomized communication complexity of this problem and shows that for r-round randomized protocols its communication complexity is at least Ω((n/α)1/r ).

Cognitive science dates back to the time when Soviet psychology reached its theoretical zenith, with Lev Vygotsky’s cultural-historical psychology taken up by his students and colleagues, first of all by Alexander Luria in his concept of the dynamic localization of higher mental functions, with Alexei Leontiev’s emerging theory of activity implemented in the studies related to the Kharkiv school of psychology (on the Kharkiv school, see Yasnitsky and Ferrari, 2008), and one more version of the theory of activity proposed by S. L. Rubinstein. Lacking scientific communication, Soviet experimental psychology of cognition and cognitive psychology tapped at the same issues from different theoretical viewpoints and, as a result, constructed two different understandings of the “cognitive subject,” quite far from each other, even if echoing each other in some respects. And it was not until the twenty-first century that these two began noticeably converging. Not so typical of science, cognitive science has got a specific birth date – September 11, 1956, the second day of the Information Processing Symposium at MIT, where three seminal talks were given. A linguist, Noam Chomsky, presented his original understanding of language in “The three models for the description of language”; a psychologist, George Miller, proposed a short-term memory model in his talk “The magic number 7 plus or minus 2”; and Allen Newell and Herbert Simon described the very first artificial intelligence model, “Logic Theorist,” proving formal logic theorems. The four speakers, together with Jerome Bruner, the founder of the first Cognitive Science Center at Harvard in 1960, are commonly considered as the fathers of cognitive science (e.g. Gardner, 1987; Thagard, 2005). © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954241286

For each fixed value of the pressure, a series of experiments was carried out with different forming times to obtain evolutions of dome height H and thickness s. These data were processed by the proposed method to obtain the flow stress dependence on the effective strain rate. The constitutive equations were obtained by least squares minimization of deviations between the experimental variations of H and s and ones predicted by a simplified engineering model.

Incentives for private partners are created through extra benefits (often non-contractible) from their collaboration with the government (e.g. risk reduction, reputational gains, access to additional resources, lower bureaucratic burden, etc.). In a well-developed institutional environment these benefits are implicitly guaranteed, suggesting no need in a specialized PPP-enabling legislation. Otherwise, a PPP law should establish an institutional architecture to provide the above benefits. © 2014 by PrAcademics Press.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84927673758

We conducted an analysis of GCC and BRIC countries to show the different strategies leaders have taken to try and achieve this aspiration. This paper analyses the various aspects of national innovation systems of BRIC and GCC countries, highlights similar and different approaches and attempts to quantify their success. For example, GCC countries spend extensively on research and development (R&D), but have so far achieved less than meaningful results. Brazil, China and India are catching up to the acknowledged world leaders in innovation, but Russia is lagging. Design/methodology/approach - Our comparison was based mostly on secondary data from sources and institutions that use statistical data to build country rankings, such as the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) produced by the World Economic Forum. BRIC and GCC countries were analyzed over 1996-2011 because most of the indicators data are only available from 1996. Data related to intellectual property rights have been collected since 1999 or 2000. The data available for the number of researchers proved problematic for both BRIC and GCC countries. For instance, some data for the GCC countries was missing. To not leave a gap, we extrapolated in line with the overall trend; using the least squares method to approximate a straight line for the missing data based on what had already been reported. Findings - Counter-intuitively, we will argue that the push toward an innovation-based economy is actually not dependent on total expenditure on R&D, but rather relies on the efficient allocation of investments and the rigorous implementation of innovation strategy. And, we will demonstrate this by showing our ideas in relation to both BRIC and GCC countries. This analysis raises fascinating points of discussion for those looking to build an innovation economy in other countries and has practical implications for policy-makers and policy implementers in all countries.

An analysis of relationships between existential psychology (EP) and traditional mainstream psychology is focused on the issue of determinism versus self-determination; meaning as conceptualized in EP is treated as the key mechanism that can make a person to a large degree free from the rigid mechanisms of biological and social programming and open the new possibilities for action in the specifically human dimension. Meaning is relevant to humans rather than animals, to being-in-the-world rather than behaving-in-the-environment. The essence of meaning is treated as reference to a broader context; this is why meaning of any object cannot be found in this object as it is, but rather in the network of its relationships with broader contexts. The author’s multiregulation model of personality describes meaning-based regulation as one of the principal mechanisms of human activity regulation and specifies its interplay with other forms of regulation. Finally, meaning regulation is analyzed both theoretically and experimentally as an important resource of freedom, autonomy, and field-independence. It is experimentally shown that high level of meaning accounts for autonomous behavior in an unstructured boring situation and makes an opposition to helplessness. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925517085

The article explores the ability of transformed institutions to limit the politicisation of energy and to reconcile the EU competitive-market approach with Russian state capitalism. More specifically, the article focuses on changes in intergovernmental, transgovernmental and transnational interactions. The article demonstrates that the gradual strengthening of transgovernmental and transnational institutions has inhibited the politicisation of energy relations and facilitated regulative cooperation between the EU and Russia. However, the potential of shared institutions is constrained by internal institutions on both sides. In Russia, these obstacles are insufficient top-down delegation of responsibilities in the government and its great power aspirations. In the EU, key barriers include inter-institutional rivalries, the EU's propensity to impose its legislation on external partners and the integration of energy policy with foreign policy. The article presents several policy implications. First, it is futile to institutionally impose the regulative paradigm of one partner on the other; rather, mutual dialogue is needed. Thus, institutions should be structured appropriately. Second, current depoliticisation will require the involvement of not only the EU and Russia but also transit countries, such as Ukraine. Third, transgovernmental and transnational cooperation should be nurtured because this is a useful channel for both information exchange and a regulative convergence of policy implementing mechanisms. Finally, this incremental regulative convergence is the only option available today for the EU and Russia; this is also a way to further depoliticise energy relations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy charter treaty; Energy dialogue; EU-Russian energy relations; Rational choice institutionalism; Transgovernmental; Transnational levels","Commerce; Laws and legislation; Public policy; Energy dialogue; Energy relations; Rational choice institutionalism; Transgovernmental; Transnational levels; Societies and institutions","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924111225

An algorithm of construction of such a grid is proposed. This algorithm is based on correlation between the value of risk premium, the category of geological information about reserves (resources) and the class of geological complexity of mineral reserves (resources). Recurrent formulae are proposed for accurate calculation of risk premiums. As against the existing grids of risk premiums, the proposed model is based on mathematical calculation rather than on expert estimation of risk premiums. It helps reduce the impact of subjectivity. It also helps easily modify the grid if necessary. In addition, the proposed model takes into account the nonlinear growth of risk premiums with decrease of amount of information available about mineral reserves (resources). This nonlinearity is almost absent in the existing grids of risk premiums. The proposed grid of risk premiums is used as a basis for the evaluation method for economic effectiveness of geological exploration. This method takes into account not only the increase of mineral reserves (resources), but also the decrease of risk of the reserves appraisal and the decrease of risk premium. This method helps calculate additional economic effect that is neglected in the existing methods. The main inconvenience of the proposed unified grid of risk premiums is that it disregards specific features of mineral reserves that may have a great impact on risk evaluation. That is why the proposed method should be used at earlier stages of geological exploration when it is necessary to make decision about the use of mineral reserves (resources). A more precise evaluation of risk should include expert estimations.","Cost estimate of deposits; Discount rate; Estimation of actual reserves and undiscovered potential reserves of hard minerals; Geological-andeconomic appraisal of deposits; Risk premium",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922542002

However, there are serious limitations to research on WM in aphasia largely due to the lack of an established valid measure of WM impairment for this population. The aim of the current study was to address shortcomings of previous measures by developing and empirically evaluating a novel WM task with a sentence-picture matching processing component designed to circumvent confounds inherent in existing measures of WM in aphasia. The novel WM task was presented to persons with (n= 27) and without (n= 33) aphasia. Results demonstrated high concurrent validity of a novel WM task. Individuals with aphasia performed significantly worse on all conditions of the WM task compared to individuals without aphasia. Different patterns of performance across conditions were observed for the two groups. Additionally, WM capacity was significantly related to auditory comprehension abilities in individuals with mild aphasia but not those with moderate aphasia. Strengths of the novel WM task are that it allows for differential control for length versus complexity of verbal stimuli and indexing of the relative influence of each, minimizes metalinguistic requirements, enables control for complexity of processing components, allows participants to respond with simple gestures or verbally, and eliminates reading requirements. Results support the feasibility and validity of using a novel task to assess WM in individuals with and without aphasia.Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to (1) discuss the limitations of current working memory measures for individuals with aphasia; (2) describe how task design features of a new working memory task for people with aphasia address shortcomings of existing measures; (3) summarize the evidence supporting the validity of the novel working memory task. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Aphasia; Cognitive processing; Complex span tasks; Working memory; Working memory assessment","adult; aged; aphasia; Article; clinical article; comprehension; concurrent validity; controlled study; disease severity; female; human; intermethod comparison; language ability; language processing; male; mental performance; middle aged; modified listening span task; neuropsychological test; traditional listening span task; working memory; young adult; aphasia; attention; case control study; psychology; short term memory; Adult; Aged; Aphasia; Attention; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920187102

Conformance checking techniques are used to diagnose the deviations of the observed behavior as recorded in the event log from some process model. Model enhancement allows to extend process models using additional perspectives, conformance and performance information.

We examined the role of attention in trans-saccadic localization by asking participants to localize targets while performing an attentionally demanding secondary task. In the first experiment, attentional load decreased localization precision for a remembered target, but only when a saccade intervened between target presentation and report. We then repeated the experiment and included a salient landmark that shifted on half the trials. The shifting landmark had a larger effect on localization under high load, indicating that observers rely more on landmarks to make localization judgments under high than under low attentional load. The results suggest that attention facilitates trans-saccadic localization judgments based on spatial updating of gaze-centered coordinates when visual landmarks are not available. The availability of reliable landmarks (present in most natural circumstances) can compensate for the effects of scarce attentional resources on trans-saccadic localization. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Attentional load; Eye movements; Remapping; Spatial vision; Visual attention","attention; depth perception; eye fixation; human; photostimulation; physiology; psychomotor performance; saccadic eye movement; vision; visual acuity; Attention; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Saccades; Space Perception; Visual Acuity; Visual Perception","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84914816955

Currently there are no exact approaches (known to the authors) suggested for solving the CFP with the grouping efficacy objective.

When a firm has full bargaining power, the non-contractibility of this investment completely undermines the employee's incentives. However, the incumbent firm's inability to observe competing wage offers at the interim stage prevents it from completely expropriating the surplus, thereby creating incentives for the employee to invest. We demonstrate that commitment to a wage floor for the second period destroys the worker's incentives to acquire human capital, but makes turnover efficient. Therefore, such a commitment has value only if the return on the employee's deliberate investment in human capital acquisition is sufficiently low. When firms are privately informed about the productivity of their human capital acquisition technology, more productive firms offer higher entry wages to separate themselves from less productive firms. Furthermore, in contrast to the case of symmetric information about human capital acquisition technology, the commitment opportunity now has value for firms with higher return on investment: commitment to a wage floor acts as a substitute for raising the entry wage. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin / Boston 2014.","asymmertric information; commitment; discretionary investment; incomplete contracts; specific human dapital",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907699133

Questionnaires (specific and non-specific) are used to assess it. Objective: To validate the Russian version of the specific quality of life questionnaire ""NeuroQol"" in diabetic patients with peripheral polyneuropathy. Materials and Methods: A total of 371 diabetic patients participated in the study. All patients were screened for the signs of peripheral neuropathy and limb ischemia. The examination results were used to evaluate the eligibility of a patient; the eligible patients were then asked to fill in the quality of life questionnaire. The validation included translation, pilot testing and assessment of reliability and validity. Results: Cronbach's alpha coefficient of internal consistency exceeded 0.8 in all scales and proved the high reliability of the questionnaire. Criterion validity was analyzed by Spearmen correlation (r) coefficient between the domains and external parameters. The results obtained revealed significant correlation between NeuroQol domains and neuropathy severity, which indicates adequate criterion validity. The psychometric assessment (construct validity) was performed using factor analysis. The physical and psychosocial factors contributing to the quality of life were identified; they confirmed the validity of the questionnaire structure. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that the Russian version of the NeuroQol questionnaire is valid and reliable. This questionnaire enables one to assess quality of life in patients with the signs of peripheral diabetic polyneuropathy, including evaluation of the efficiency of various treatment strategies for complications. The lack of social life and psychological conditions of patients affect their quality of life more than physical complications do. These parameters must become the focus of specialists' attention in their efforts to improve the quality of life in this category of patients.","Diabetes mellitus; Diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy; Quality of life; Quality of life questionnaire","article; correlation coefficient; criterion related validity; Cronbach alpha coefficient; diabetic neuropathy; disease severity; human; limb ischemia; major clinical study; psychologic assessment; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; Russian Federation; validation study; adult; Article; construct validity; controlled study; diabetic patient; disease duration; female; male; pain severity; polyneuropathy; psychometry; questionnaire; rating scale; sensitivity analysis; social psychology; validation process; hemoglobin A1c","Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905492819

We used this opportunity to study the decay of historic consonant alternations in Russian. In standard Russian, these alternations are present in some verb forms and in comparatives (e.g. suxoj 'dry' - sushe 'drier', ljubit' 'to love' - ljublju 'I love'), as well as before certain derivational suffixes. Verb forms have been recently studied by Slioussar and Kholodilova (2013), and we looked at comparatives. Two groups of adjectives were selected: ones that have normative comparatives with alternations and ones that do not, but native speakers still try to generate such forms. In the first group, some adjectives like ubogij 'poky' have up to 30 % of comparatives without alternations, but, unlike with verbs, no significant correlation with adjective frequency or its other characteristics was found. The second group consisted primarily of compound adjectives ending in -gij, -kij, -xij. Here, the most important factor is whether the second part of the compound is used as an independent adjective. If it is not (e.g. as in dlinnorukij 'long- Armed'), most comparatives lack alternations. Searching for forms on the Internet, we faced many problems. The counts provided by search engines are extremely inaccurate, only the first thousand results are shown, they cannot be downloaded in a convenient format, contain a lot of typos and other irrelevant data etc. We present a program called Lingui-Pingui that we developed to solve these and some other problems.","Comparative; Consonants; Historical alternations; Search optimization",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904818552

Process mining discovery algorithms deal with large data sets to learn automatically process models. As more event data become available there is the desire to learn larger and more complex process models. To tackle problems related to the readability of the resulting model and to ensure tractability, various decomposition methods have been proposed. This paper presents a novel decomposition approach for discovering more readable models from event logs on the basis of a priori knowledge about the event log structure: regular and special cases of the process execution are treated separately. The transition system, corresponding to a given event log, is decomposed into a regular part and a specific part. Then one of the known discovery algorithms is applied to both parts, and finally these models are combined into a single process model. It is proven, that the structural and behavioral properties of submodels are inherited by the unified process model. The proposed discovery algorithm is illustrated using a running example. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",,"Algorithms; Data mining; Behavioral properties; Complex Processes; Decomposition approach; Decomposition methods; Discovery algorithm; Extracting information; Process execution; Transition system; Petri nets","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904088180

The generalization of the fuzzy phonetic decoding method is proposed by assuming the distribution of the classified object to be of exponential type. Its preliminary phase includes association of each model object with the fuzzy set of model classes with grades of membership defined as the confusion probabilities estimated with the Kullback-Leibler divergence between model distributions. At first, each object (e.g., frame) in a classified sequence is put in correspondence with the fuzzy set which grades are defined as the posterior probabilities. Next, this fuzzy set is intersected with the fuzzy set corresponding to the nearest neighbor. Finally, the arithmetic mean of these fuzzy intersections is assigned to the decision for the whole sequence.

However, most respective papers limit their investigation period with the early or mid-2000s. In the authors' opinion, some of the global trends which revealed themselves particularly clearly in the second half of the 2000s call for a revision of the convergence issue. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Several methodologies for measuring the global convergence/divergence trends exist in the economic literature. This paper seeks to contribute to the existing literature on unconditional β-convergence of the per capita incomes at the global level. Findings: In the recent years, the gap between high-income and middle-income countries is decreasing especially rapidly. The gap between high-income and low-income countries, meanwhile, is decreasing at a much slower pace. At the same time, the gap between middle-income and low-income countries is actually widening. Indeed, in the early 1980s GDP per capita in the low-income countries was on average three times lower than in the middle-income countries, and this gap was totally overshadowed by the more than ten-time abyss between the middle-income and the high-income countries. Now, however, the GDP per capita in low-income countries lags behind the middle-income ones by more than five times, which is largely the same as the gap (rapidly contracting in the recent years) between the high-income and the middle-income countries. This clearly suggests that the configuration of the world system has experienced a very significant transformation in the recent 30 years. Research limitations/implications: The research concentrates upon the dynamics of the gap in per capita income between the high-income, the middle-income, and the low-income countries. Originality/value: This paper's originality/value lies in drawing attention to the specific changes in the structure of global convergence/divergence patterns and their implications for the low-income countries. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Catch-up; Classification; Convergence; Development; Global studies; Globalization; Innovation; Low-income countries; Middle-income countries; Systems theory; Technological innovation",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903600147

Manufacturers are not completely aware of consumer needs; as a result, skilled users can improve products and suit them to their needs. Users best judge what will lead to commercial success, and they have long been recognized as a valuable source of knowledge to harvest for future innovation. Therefore, firms now involve customers in developing product ideas that are usable and valuable. The challenge is that valuable consumer-related knowledge is widely dispersed, and aggregating it is a complex and expensive task. However, the development of ICT opens up new possibilities, in particular, for innovation communities linking users with different needs and experiences. Interaction with users allows companies to integrate distributed knowledge, which gives the opportunity to improve the functionality and quality of the developed products. This paper analyses trends of user innovation development, their motivations to participate in innovation communities, the benefits that the company can gain from interaction with these communities, and the risks associated with a particular focus on the needs of a limited or overly wide range of consumers. It provides cases of user innovation in a number of sectors: software, hardware, construction, sports, medicine, fashion and design. The authors conclude that innovation communities are a powerful tool allowing integration of the dispersed knowledge of users into strategic decision making. The knowledge generation of inputs from innovation communities is facilitated by new analysis and data mining tools that make it easy to visualize and detect structures in virtual communication. The use of such instruments has large innovation potential if companies succeed in integrating real life conditions into technical innovations.","Communication technologies; Information; Innovation communities; Knowledge sharing; Lead users; Open innovation; User innovation",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902505564

In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach, which takes event logs (e.g., trace data) of a software system for the analysis of the user and system runtime behavior and for improving the software. We use well-established methods from the area of process mining for this analysis. Moreover, we suggest embedding process mining into the agile development lifecycle.

Intensity and efficiency of linkages is widely considered as one of the major determinants of innovation system performance. This paper presents empirical estimates of the scale and character of interactions between companies and research organisations in the Russian economy. The data are derived from the surveys of 1000 enterprises (2011) and 1000 research organisations (2012). The questionnaire is designed to allow characterization of cooperative practices and knowledge demand and supply. One of the key findings on the demand side is significant heterogeneity of involvement by sectors in the knowledge transfer process. Specific sectors (e.g. petrochemistry, equipment manufacturing) are tightly integrated with R&D institutions, while others (e.g. consumer goods, wood processing industries) are not linked to the Russian S&T development complex. This diversity of practices is partly determined by the overall allocation of resources within the economy as well as specific competition regimes that limit short- and medium-term benefits from R&D. Similarly, on the knowledge supply side, R&D organisations do not treat technology transfer as a priority strategy for sustainable development. Indeed, they focus on intellectual services instead of R&D, that is, on consulting and modification of existing technologies. Among innovation-active companies, only 14% rely on the R&D results of Russian research centers. Of those actually engaged in co-operation, 12% of companies indicate implementation of new-to-the-world products or production processes and 29% new-to-the-country innovations. Generally, low demand for R&D meets limited novelty of research results produced by the research organisations (compared to the technologies available on the global markets). Thus there are limited enclaves of efficient co-operation. These are mainly grouped around traditionally arranged institutional linkages as well as existing allocations of financial resources across the economic sectors.","Co-operation; Innovation; Innovation activities; Innovative enterprises; R and D transfer; Scientific organisations",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902461043

During the previous 10 years, Putin's rating had correlated closely with Russians' perceptions of the state of the economy. Yet the fall in his approval - from 79% in December 2010 to 63% a year later - occurred despite roughly stable economic perceptions. Comparing Levada Center polls from late 2010 and 2011, the paper explores both who (what types of respondents) grew disenchanted with Putin, and why (what issues or grievances prompted this switch). It finds that (a) the fall in support for the Kremlin - although faster among members of the ""creative class,"" women, the rich, and residents of provincial cities - was broad-based, occurring among all social groups examined; (b) attitudes toward immigration, the West, and Russia's international status, as well as assessments of public service quality, changed little during 2011; (c) Putin's declining popularity most likely reflected stronger - not weaker - economic concerns; although the proportion judging economic performance to be poor did not increase, those who saw economic weakness became much less supportive of the Kremlin.

The first aim of the paper is to attract the attention of the researchers and educators throughout the world to a poorly recognized kind of existential risk: it is the dangerous consequences of misusing the information and communication technologies by adolescents in the context of permanently increasing intelligent capabilities of computers and an easy access to Internet. The second, principal aim of this paper is to propose a constructive way out: it is earlier than usually socialization of children in order to inscribe a deep awareness of social responsibility into the conceptual picture of the child and adolescent and to enable him/her to analyse the consequences of the fulfilled actions. The proposed way out is elaborated under the framework of a new scientific discipline called cognitonics. This way is provided by the System of the Methods of Emotional-Imaginative Teaching (the EIT-system). The constructive core of this paper consists of two parts. The first part considerably expands the Level of Consciousness model proposed by P.D. Zelazo in 2004. It considers fours levels of the development of conscious control of thought, emotion, and action and covers the child's age from one to four years. Our model is based on the EITsystem and introduces three additional levels, where the seventh level is called the level of enhanced awareness of social agreements and social responsibility. Our model covers the ages from five - six to 13 - 14 years. The second part of this paper's constructive core presents a new look at the process of education when the values of the student act like a lighthouse for the teacher at the moment of presenting material and arranging the process of education, the process of acquiring knowledge.","Cognitive engagement; Early socialization of children; Informational-aesthetic conception of developing cognitive-emotional sphere; Levels of consciousness expanded model; Methods of emotional-imaginative teaching; Misuse of information and communication technologies; Positive psychology movement; System of values; Theory of dynamic conceptual mappings","Information technology; Social sciences; Cognitive engagement; Conceptual mapping; Early socialization of children; Information and Communication Technologies; Positive psychology; System of values; Education computing","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897983437

Design/methodology/approach: Core company's intangibles are combined into six intellectual capital (IC) elements that appear after the division of each of the traditional components (human, structural and relational capital (RC)). The human capital includes management and human resources capabilities (HRC). Structural capital is divided into innovation and internal process capabilities (IPC). RC contains networking capabilities and customer loyalty. In drawing on the relevant literature each element is described through a set of indicators collected from publicly available data. The validity of proposed IC model is justified through structural equation modeling. Each element is tested on a sample of more than 1,650 listed European companies over the period of 2004-2011. Findings: The study gives empirical support of three component IC structure and its decomposition into second level. The findings reveal that implementation of KM plays a significant role for HRC as well as for IPC. Research limitations/implications: The analysis was conducted for a particular sample that may restrict the conclusions. Practical implications: The proposed measurements for intangibles can be applied by any company for benchmarking and comparative analysis in KM.

First, some conditions should be met to exercise such choice, of which the most important is the provision of reliable data on providers' performance to both patients and physicians as their agents, as well as increasing primary health care (PHC) providers' involvement in realization of patient choice. Second, expanding patient choice does not always lead to efficient allocation of resources in a healthcare system. This article explores these controversial developments by using empirical evidence from the Russian Federation. It shows that choice indeed has value for patients, but there are many areas of inefficient choice, which leads to misallocation of healthcare recourses. Thus, health policy in this area should be designed to ensure a reasonable balance between objectives of expanding choice and promoting more efficient organization of healthcare provision.

The authors also introduce the system of proxy indicator for personal intellectual capital (IC) of football coaches. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs the idea that personal welfare depends on personal IC, particularly, talent. That is why initially the literature analysis of welfare phenomenon was provided. Then the system of available proxy indicators of football coaches' IC was designed. To achieve the purpose a linear function is estimated with the help of ordinary least squares method. Findings: The chosen set of IC proxy indicators explain the significant part of coaches' salary. Such proxies as improvement in the championship table and coach's image in media have a significant and positive influence on coach's salary. Whereas, lowering the position of the club does not considerably affect the coach's wealth. A clubs' financial capacities and budget also influences coaches' salaries. Research limitations/implications: Traditional limitation of proxy indicators-based studies is connected with their eligibility and complexity. Practical implications: The possibility to codify IC of a person enables to analyze core competencies necessary in a particular activity or profession for success achievement. Moreover a policy of inequality reduction should take into account that intangible assets are at the base of those persons wealth. Originality/value: This is the first paper that employs IC concept to people wealth while previous literature is dedicated to companies' or countries' IC. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Empirical study; Intellectual capital; Personal development; Welfare",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890881677

I consider whether the degree of within-country consensus around values has increased in recent decades, eliminating the Fischer and Schwartz (2011) challege to 'shared-value' theories of culture.

More precisely, we restrict attention to a dual characterization of the value function of this problem and to a static setting. A general scheme to solve this problem is proposed. In the case where the utility function is finite on ℝ, we use the approach, suggested by Biagini and Frittelli, based on using an Orlicz space constructed from an investor’s utility function. We reduce the original problem to an optimization problem in this space in a nontrivial way, which allows us to weaken essentially assumptions on the model. We also study the problem of utility maximization with random endowment considered by Cvitanić, Schachermayer, and Wang. Using the space ψL∞ with a weight function ψ constructed from a random endowment permits us to consider unbounded random endowments. Another important contribution is that in both problems under consideration, we provide versions of the dual problem that are free of singular functionals. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037746463

The first step of such an analysis is to describe the considered financial market via the correlation matrix of stocks prices over a certain period of time. The second step is to build a graph in which vertices represent stocks and edge weights represent correlation coefficients between the corresponding stocks. In this paper we suggest a new method of analyzing stock markets based on dividing a market into several substructures (called stars) in which all stocks are strongly correlated with a leading (central, median) stock. Our method is based on the p-median model a feasible solution to which is represented by a collection of stars. Our reduction of the adjusted p-Median Problem to the Mixed Boolean pseudo-Boolean Linear Programming Problem is able to find an exact optimal solution for markets with at most 1,000 stocks by means of general purpose solvers like CPLEX. We have designed and implemented a high-quality greedy-type heuristic for large-sized (many thousands of stocks) markets. We observed an important “median nesting” property of returned solutions: the p leading stocks, or medians, of the stars are repeated in the solution for p + 1 stars. Moreover, many leading stocks (medians), for example, in the USA stock market are the well-known market indices and funds such as the Dow Jones, S&P which form the largest stars (clusters). © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cluster analysis by stars; Leading stocks; p-Median problem; Pseudo-Boolean approach; Russia; Stock markets analysis; Sweden; USA",,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029608060

The theme of solidarity permeates all his work.

A single slot is a time span that can be assigned to a task, which is a part of a job. The job launch requires a co-allocation of a specified number of slots starting synchronously. The challenge is that slots associated with different resources of distributed computational environments may have arbitrary start and finish points that do not match. Some existing algorithms assign a job to the first set of slots matching the resource request without any optimization (the first fit type), while other approaches are based on an exhaustive search. In our approach, co-allocation strategies formalized by given criteria are implemented by algorithms of linear complexity on an available slots number. The novelty of the approach consists of allocating alternative sets of dynamically updated slots based on the information from local resource managers in the node domains. It provides possibilities to optimize job scheduling during resource selection. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,,"English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958540675

But these have all been in relatively low circular ""Low-Earth"" orbits (LEO) that have relatively long revisit times over a given area. This paper will describe a set of satellites in Molniya orbits with apogees above areas of interest continuously taking general images of large portions of the whole Earth's surface with low resolution (on the order of 1 km), thus monitoring the overall state of the surface. When required, for example, if a forest fire has been identified, a sensor with much higher resolution can be pointed at the area of study. We will consider the requirements for the spacecraft in Molniya orbits for general monitoring of the Earth's surface, especially the northern forests of Russia, Canada, and other northern countries. The 12-hour Molniya orbits at the critical inclination of 63.4 deg will have a perigee height around 300 km with an argument of perigee of -90 deg.; then the apogee height (where the spacecraft spend most of their time) will be about 40,000 km, similar to the distance to a geosynchronous spacecraft, over the northernmost latitude of the orbit, 63.4 deg. A total of four spacecraft, with two of them in each of two orbit planes with their longitude of ascending node 180 deg. apart, will give good coverage of all of the northern regions, since there will always be two satellites near apogee over longitudes 180 deg. apart. But twice a year, all of the orbits will be near the Earth's terminator, with poor illumination for visual images. To avoid this problem, six satellites are needed, two each in three orbit planes with longitudes of ascending node separated by 120 deg. One satellite in each orbit (total of 3) is possible; with proper phasing, two of the spacecraft would be close enough to apogee most of the time for good coverage of most areas of interest. Results will be presented for launch windows that avoid decreasing perigee heights caused by lunisolar perturbations. Also, realistic force models show that the longitudes of ascending node, and thus the sub-Earth apogee points, drift from their initial positions. A strategy will be presented for minimizing the total delta-V for stationkeeping maneuvers needed to counter-act the longitude drift.

The method of krokodil preparation may produce desomorphine as well as toxic reactants that cause extensive tissue necrosis. The first confirmed report of krokodil use in Russia took place in 2004. In 2012, reports of krokodil-related injection injuries began to appear beyond Russia in Western Europe and the United States. Objective: This exploratory study had two main objectives: (1) to determine if Internet search patterns could detect regularities in behavioral responses to Russian CCM policy at the population level, and (2) to determine if complementary data sources could explain the regularities we observed. Methods: First, we obtained krokodil-related search pattern data for each Russia subregion (oblast) between 2011 and 2012. Second, we analyzed several complementary data sources included krokodil-related court cases, and related search terms on both Google and Yandex to evaluate the characteristics of terms accompanying krokodil-related search queries. Results: In the 6 months preceding CCM sales restrictions, 21 of Russia's 83 oblasts had search rates higher than the national average (mean) of 16.67 searches per 100,000 population for terms associated with krokodil. In the 6 months following restrictions, mean national searches dropped to 9.65 per 100,000. Further, the number of oblasts recording a higher than average search rate dropped from 30 to 16. Second, we found krokodil-related court appearances were moderately positively correlated (Spearman correlation=.506, P≤.001) with behaviors consistent with an interest in the production and use of krokodil across Russia. Finally, Google Trends and Google and Yandex related terms suggested consistent public interest in the production and use of krokodil as well as for CCM as analgesic medication during the date range covered by this study. Conclusions: Illicit drug use data are generally regarded as difficult to obtain through traditional survey methods. Our analysis suggests it is plausible that Yandex search behavior served as a proxy for patterns of krokodil production and use during the date range we investigated. More generally, this study demonstrates the application of novel methods recently used by policy makers to both monitor illicit drug use and influence drug policy decision making.","Controlled substances; Designer drugs; Russia; Search engine; Street drugs; Surveillance","codeine; krokodil; morphine derivative; street drug; adult; analogs and derivatives; epidemiological monitoring; health care policy; health survey; human; Internet; male; Opioid-Related Disorders; procedures; Russian Federation; substance abuse; trends; United States; Adult; Codeine; Epidemiological Monitoring; Health Policy; Humans; Internet; Male; Morphine Derivatives; Opioid-Related Disorders; Public Health Surveillance; Russia; Street Drugs; Substance Abuse Detection; United States","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928945101

An important problem on multicast networks, known as the delay constrained multicast routing problem (DCMRP), asks for the determination of an optimal route for packet transfers between members of a multicast group. Several heuristics have been proposed in the last few years to solve the DCMRP, which is of great interest for telecommunication engineers. In this paper we propose a novel, hybrid metaheuristic approach for the DCMRP, where a greedy randomized adaptive search procedure is used along with variable neighborhood search algorithm to find near optimal solutions.

Confirmatory factor analysis supported a theoretical model with seven scales, including three scales measuring types of intrinsic motivation (intrinsic cognition, achievement, and personal growth), three scales measuring extrinsic motivation (motivation for self-respect, introjected, and external regulation), and an amotivation scale. All the scales have sufficient reliability (Cronbach's alpha coefficients in the. 71 to. 92 range) and demonstrate predictable correlations with other measures of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, curiosity, and satisfaction of three basic needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness).

It was followed by a focus on geometrically inhomogeneous systems like point contacts, which provided a very clear manifestation of the energy and direction dependence of the Andreev reflection process. The point contacts have recently evolved towards the atomic scale owing to the use of mechanical break-junctions, revealing a very detailed dependence of Andreev reflection on the macroscopic phase of the superconducting state. In present-day research, the superconducting in homogeneity is constructed by clean room technology and combines superconducting materials, for example, with low-dimensional materials and topological insulators. Alternatively, the superconductor is combined with nano-objects, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, or semiconducting nanowires.

Trajectory calculations of one-impulse Earth-halo orbit transfers with and without using a lunar gravitational maneuver are presented. For the calculation of one-impulse trajectories of Earth-halo-orbit transfers, an algorithm for constructing initial approximations is applied. These approximations are constructed by calculating and analyzing the isolines as a function of two variables. This function is represented by the pericenter height of the outgoing orbit over the Earth’s surface. The arguments of the function are special parameters that characterize the halo orbit. The mentioned algorithm allows one to obtain halo orbits with specified geometrical characteristics both in the ecliptic plane, and in the plane orthogonal to it. The estimates of the characteristic velocity expenses for maintaining SC in the selected halo orbit are obtained.

However, this titling reform increased land liquidity and actually promoted migration by easing financial constraints and decreasing opportunity costs. Treating the reform as a quasi-natural experiment, we employ difference-in-differences analysis on a panel of province-level data that describe migration and economic conditions. We find that the reform had a sizeable effect on migration. To verify the land liquidity effect, we exploit variation in the number of households participating in the reform.

Our study is the first step towards the 'smart' evaluation tool which would introduce linguistically relevant criteria to evaluation; be able to put the mistakes on a scale from minor to critical ones; make evaluation easier in case the grid of roles varies. We run an experiment based on the data from the Russian FrameBank, a FrameNet-oriented open access database which includes a dictionary of Russian lexical constructions and a corpus of tagged examples. The semantic role is one of the parameters that define the predicate- Argument patterns in FrameBank. The inventory of roles is modeled hierarchically and forms a graph. We explore the cases when the role induced by the system and the answer of the gold standard do not match. We analyze the statistical criteria of distribution of roles in the patterns and the distance between the source and the target in the graph of roles as a mean to assess the goodness of fit.","Constructions; Corpus linguistics; Evaluation; Lexical resources; Polysemy; Semantic role labeling; Semantic roles",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904795616

Devices connected to the internet (internet of things), social interaction, mobile computing, and cloud computing provide new sources of event data and this trend will continue. The omnipresence of large amounts of event data is an important enabler for process mining. Process mining techniques can be used to discover, monitor and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from observed behavior. However, unprecedented volumes of event data also provide new challenges and often state-of-the-art process mining techniques cannot cope. This paper focuses on ""conformance checking in the large"" and presents a novel decomposition technique that partitions larger process models and event logs into smaller parts that can be analyzed independently. The so-called Single-Entry Single-Exit (SESE) decomposition not only helps to speed up conformance checking, but also provides improved diagnostics. The analyst can zoom in on the problematic parts of the process. Importantly, the conditions under which the conformance of the whole can be assessed by verifying the conformance of the SESE parts are described, which enables the decomposition and distribution of large conformance checking problems.

The role of stimulus parameters in completing a visual task (detecting changes) was investigated. The following parameters of visual stimuli varied in a chronometric experiment: the number of objects, their location in the stimulus space, and the shape of the objects (including a new object that attracts attention as well as various changes of single objects, such as appearance/disappearance, location shifts, changes of color and shape). The results of this study indicate that change blindness can have a different intensity (the time of detecting changes in flickering images) depending on the number of objects, their location in the stimulus space (structured or randomized), and the type of change (the most complicated one was a change of color): 1. The number of objects has considerable influence on the intensity of change blindness and is the most powerful parameter. 2. The shape of the objects within the image is not crucial for change-detection time. 3. The spatial organization of the objects is important for the successful detection of changes. The changes are detected quicker in images with regular rather than random organization. 4. A distraction (in this case, a word that was substituted for an object) doesn't have any considerable influence on change detection. 5. Change-detection time increases as the interstimulus interval increases from 200 to 400 ms. 6. The detection of shifts and of appearance/disappearance is quicker than the detection of color change. These results let us create stimulus patterns for change-blindness experiments that differ in complexity, and thus we could examine a wide range of hypotheses about the function of the psychological mechanisms of spatial attention that are used to explain this phenomenon. © Lomonosov Moscow State University, 2014. © Russian Psychological Society, 2014.","Change blindness; Spatial attention; Stimulus determinants",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904412369

This finding is usually ascribed to the orienting of spatial attention to the cued location. Here we examine the role of perceptual merging of the two trial events in speeded target detection. That is, the cue and target may be perceived as a single event when they appear in the same location. If so, cueing effects could reflect, in part, the binding of the perceived target onset to the earlier cue onset. We observed the traditional facilitation of cued over uncued targets and asked the same observers to judge target onset time by noting the time on a clock when the target appeared. Observers consistently judged the onset time of the target as being earlier than it appeared with cued targets judged as earlier than uncued targets. When the event order is reversed so that the target precedes the cue, perceived onset is accurate in both cued and uncued locations. This pattern of results suggests that perceptual merging does occur in exogenous cueing. A modified attention account is discussed that proposes reentrant processing, evident through perceptual merging, as the underlying mechanism of reflexive orienting of attention. © 2014 ARVO.","Cueing; Perceptual merging; Re-entrant processing; Visual attention","article; association; attention; cueing; female; human; male; perceptual merging; physiology; psychomotor performance; re-entrant processing; reaction time; vision; visual attention; young adult; cueing; perceptual merging; re-entrant processing; visual attention; Attention; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Visual Perception; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904245398

Drawing on the existing empirical studies, Chinese-language reports and articles, official document analysis, and on several unstructured interviews with Chinese academics, the article attempts to evaluate the extent to which deliberative democratic principles are present in the process of healthcare policy making. To achieve this analytical goal, it develops and applies five criteria of good deliberation.

This is especially true in cooperative environments relying heavily on human knowledge. Declarative languages, like Declare, alleviate this issue by not describing what to do step-by-step but by defining a set of constraints between actions that must not be violated during the process execution. Furthermore, in modern cooperative business, time is of utmost importance. Therefore, declarative process models should be able to take this dimension into consideration. Timed Declare has already previously been introduced to monitor temporal constraints at runtime, but it has until now only been possible to provide an alert when a constraint has already been violated without the possibility of foreseeing and avoiding such violations. In this paper, we introduce an extended version of Timed Declare with a formal timed semantics for the entire language. The semantics degenerates to the untimed semantics in the expected way. We also introduce a translation to timed automata, which allows us to detect inconsistencies in models prior to execution and to early detect that a certain task is time sensitive. This means that either the task cannot be executed after a deadline (or before a latency), or that constraints are violated unless it is executed before (or after) a certain time. This makes it possible to use declarative process models to provide a priori guidance instead of just a posteriori detecting that an execution is invalid. We also outline how a Declare model with time can be used in resource planning and how Declare has been integrated into CPN Tools. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Declarative process modeling; Declare; error detection; metric temporal logic; operational support; planning; timed automata",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900496111

An ethology is a study of an animal in its natural environment, and here we examine the fixation patterns of the human animal searching a series of challenging illustrated scenes that are well-known in popular culture. The search was free of secondary tasks, probes, and other distractions. Our goal was to describe saccadic behavior, including patterns of fixation duration, saccade amplitude, and angular direction. In particular, we employed both new and established techniques for identifying top-down strategies, any influences of bottom-up image salience, and the midlevel attentional effects of saccadic momentum and inhibition of return. The visual search dynamics that we observed and quantified demonstrate that saccades are not independently generated and incorporate distinct influences from strategy, salience, and attention.

In games from both classes, payoff functions of the players are sums of linear functions of vector arguments or those of linear ones and a bilinear function. Games from the first class are those in which player strategies are connected, i.e., they cannot be chosen by the players independently, whereas player strategies in games from the second class are disjoint. For the games from both classes either sufficient or necessary and sufficient conditions of the equilibriums are provided, and these conditions allow one to calculate the equilibriums by effective optimization techniques. This fact contributes to making the equilibrium concept a productive approach to quantitatively analyzing conflicts in systems economic studies. Economic problems that appear in systems described by nonlinear mathematical models with linear constraints, in particular, by some network models, including (a) restructuring a company and positioning the restructured company in a market or in several markets, (b) forming a pool of regional clients interested in selling their products and in buying somebody else’s ones outside their regions via forward contracts offered by regional brokers, (c) determining initial prices for procurement contracts to be tendered by a public administration, (d) finding competitive transportation tariffs by a railroad company competing with tracking companies for providing transportation services both in a region and between two regions, (e) calculating an optimal volume of producing electricity by a base load power plant in a part of a country’s electrical grid under an uncertain demand in the corresponding network of the grid customers, and (f) forming a public-private partnership to develop a set of projects that a public administration needs to develop and implement, but does not have funds to finance on its own (partly or even completely) are discussed to illustrate how the games under consideration appear, and how they can be analyzed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975847280

Successive grammaticalization steps of this marker can be observed in Modern Mari: in some contexts it functions as a quotation marker, while in others as a subordinator. We suggest two paths of grammaticalization of this form on the basis of the given analysis: the first path involves the context of verbs of speech, mental and emotive complementtaking predicates, the second path involves the contexts of causation and potential situation (in complementation), purpose and causal adverbial clauses. The argumentation for this grammaticalization pattern is based on the constraints on subordinate predicate encoding (acceptability of non-finite clauses with manan), the choice of pronouns [we focus on the choice of the anaphoric vs. deictic strategy of encoding the textual («original» in [Aikhenvald 2008]) speaker and hearer] and the mood of the verb in the complement clause. We show that in Modern Mari the analyzed form can have the following functions: as a quotation marker, as a subordinator in complement and adverbial clauses, as a discourse marker of hesitation and autocorrection, and as a semantically empty subordinator that is used to express negation with the infinitive.","Anaphora; Complementation; Complementizer; Conjunction; Deixis; Grammaticalization; Infinitive; Mari; Subordination; Subordinator; Verbs of speech",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946167794

The results show that gender parity is far from being achieved. Women remain underrepresented in terms of their contribution to research output and scientific impact in almost all disciplines, with Mathematics and Physics, research areas in which Russia is specialized, having the largest gap. Men and women show different collaboration patterns on the national and international level, whereas women are preeminent on the national scene, men are on the international one. Although the impact of women’s scientific output significantly increases after the fall of the USSR, the gap between both genders remains stable over time for most of the disciplines.

They have two parameters. The limit of the first one brings the model to the ordinary rational KZ equation. Another one is т. At the level of classical mechanics the deformation parameter т allows to extend the previously obtained modified Gaudin models to the modified Schlesinger systems. Next, we notice that the identities underlying generic (elliptic) KZB equations follow from some additional relations for the properly normalized R-matrices. The relations are noncommutative analogues of identities for (scalar) elliptic functions. The simplest one is the unitarity condition. The quadratic (in R matrices) relations are generated by noncommutative Fay identities. In particular, one can derive the quantum Yang-Baxter equations from the Fay identities. The cubic relations provide identities for the KZB equations as well as quadratic relations for the classical r-matrices which can be treated as halves of the classical Yang-Baxter equation. At last we discuss the R-matrix valued linear problems which provide gl^ CM models and Painleve equations via the above mentioned identities. The role of the spectral parameter plays the Planck constant of the quantum R-matrix. When the quantum glw R-matrix is scalar (N = 1) the linear problem reproduces the Krichever's ansatz for the Lax matrices with spectral parameter for the gl^ CM models. The linear problems for the quantum CM models generalize the KZ equations in the same way as the Lax pairs with spectral parameter generalize those without it. © The Authors.","Gauge Symmetry; Integrable Equations In Physics; Quantum Groups",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928546487

The study is empirical in nature; the theoretical framework is based on the principles of the new economic geography. The analysis shows that, despite the high level of spatial concentration of economic activity, the agglomeration processes tend to continue. The factors the dynamics of spatial differences within the oblast are the size of the local markets and the intensity of relationships between market agents. At the same time the interactions between different municipal districts within the oblast are dominated by negative effects; the districts are adversely affected by the proximity to Novosibirsk, a city with a large economy. The patterns identified in the study provide evidence of a very likely increase in the polarization of Novosibirsk oblast. The processes and relationships that underlie the agglomeration tendencies in the territory are based on technological and market factors, such as increasing returns to scale of economic activity and imperfect competition in regional markets. The market transformations in Russia have strengthened the role and influence of these factors.

Our results indicate that societies with high levels of income inequality seem to provide the most favorable context for religious socialization. Individuals develop strong religious beliefs even if they only received little religious socialization within the family. Formerly socialist nations increased socialization costs through the overall suppression of religious practice.

The area of process mining deals with extracting knowledge from this data. Real-life processes can be effectively discovered, analyzed and optimized with the help of mature process mining techniques. There is a variety of process mining case studies and experience reports from such business areas as healthcare, public, transportation and education. Although nowadays, these techniques are mostly used for discovering business processes. The goal of this industrial paper is to show that process mining can be applied to software too. Here we present and analyze our experiences on applying process mining in different productive software systems used in the touristic domain. Process models and user interface workflows underlie the functional specifications of the systems we experiment with. When the systems are utilized, user interaction is recorded in event logs. After applying process mining methods to these logs, process and user interface flow models are automatically derived. These resulting models provide insight regarding the real usage of the software, motivate the changes in the functional specifications, enable usability improvements and software redesign. Thus, with the help of our examples we demonstrate that process mining facilitates new forms of software analysis. The user interaction with almost every software system can be mined in order to improve the software and to monitor and measure its real usage. © 2014 Authors.","client technology; process mining; software process mining; user interface design","Process mining; Software process; User interface designs","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907808593

Traditional multi-field classification approaches, in both software and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAMs), entail tradeoffs between (memory) space and (lookup) time. TCAMs cannot efficiently represent range rules, a common class of classification rules confining values of packet fields to given ranges. The exponential space growth of TCAM entries relative to the number of fields is exacerbated when multiple fields contain ranges. In this work, we present a novel approach which identifies properties of many classifiers which can be implemented in linear space and with worst-case guaranteed logarithmic time and allows the addition of more fields including range constraints without impacting space and time complexities. On real-life classifiers from Cisco Systems and additional classifiers from ClassBench (with real parameters), 90-95% of rules are thus handled, and the other 5-10% of rules can be stored in TCAM to be processed in parallel. © 2014 ACM.","packet classification; TCAM","Convolutional codes; Packet networks; Classification approach; Classification rules; Logarithmic time; Packet classification; Range constraints; Space and time complexity; TCAM; Ternary content addressable memory; Ternary content adressable memory","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907327762

The integrable systems (relativistic tops) are described as multidimensional Euler tops, and the inertia tensors are written in terms of the quantum and classical R-matrices. A particular case of gl N system is gauge equivalent to the N-particle RS model while a generic top is related to the spin generalization of the RS model. The simple relation between quantum R-matrices and classical Lax operators is exploited in two ways. In the elliptic case we use the Belavin's quantum R-matrix to describe the relativistic classical tops. Also by the passage to the noncommutative torus we study the large N limit corresponding to the relativistic version of the nonlocal 2d elliptic hydrodynamics. Conversely, in the rational case we obtain a new gl N quantum rational non-dynamical R-matrix via the relativistic top, which we get in a different way - using the factorized form of the RS Lax operator and the classical Symplectic Hecke (gauge) transformation. In particular case of gl 2 the quantum rational R-matrix is 11-vertex. It was previously found by Cherednik.

However, the nature of the phenomenon, as well as its interaction with other brain functions has not been fully understood. Therefore, the study of brain peculiarities of left- and right-handed subjects by neuronal network analysis is of particular interest. The aim of the investigation was to analyze brain network structures according to electroencephalography findings in left- and right-handed subjects in resting state and during cognitive testing (memorizing) using a graph theory. Materials and Methods. 44 volunteers (20 left-handed, 24 right-handed) took part in the experiment. We used three techniques to calculate the degree of spatial synchronization of EEG-signals: coherence, an imaginary part of coherence, and synchronization likelihood. On basis of the obtained graphs we built minimum spanning trees (MST) and calculated some of their characteristics. Results. Left-handers compared to right-handers were found to have more linear MST in theta band (coherence-based MST). Memorizing was characterized by the increase of MST regularity structure in alpha band for all three signal measures (coherence, an imaginary part of coherence, and synchronization likelihood). And only right-handers showed the increase in regularity for MST built on the basis of synchronization likelihood and imaginary part of coherence. Regularity increase in alpha band for coherence-based MST was not associated with handedness. Thus, MST based on synchronization likelihood and an imaginary part of coherence are more sensitive to differences between left- and right-handers during memorizing.","Brain functional relationship; Electroencephalography; Graph theory; Hand preference; Minimum spanning tree; Neuronal network","adult; article; brain asymmetry; cognition; connectome; electroencephalograph electrode; electroencephalography phase synchronization; female; frequency modulation; functional neuroimaging; handedness; human; human experiment; hypothalamus; independent component analysis; information processing; left handedness; male; mathematical analysis; medical ethics; memory; minimum spanning tree; nerve cell network; post hoc analysis; psychomotor performance; questionnaire; resting state network; right handedness; young adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903387123

PSA is involved in cell signaling and intermolecular interactions with proteins and peptides. The antimicrobial potential of peptides is usually evaluated in model membranes consisting of lipid bilayers but devoid of either PSA or its analogs. The goal of this work was to investigate the possible effect of PSA on the structure of melittin (Mlt) and latarcins Ltc1K, Ltc2a, and the activity of these peptides with respect to model membranes. These peptides are linear cationic ones derived from the venom of bee (Mlt) and spider (both latarcins). The length of each of the peptides is 26 amino acid residues, and they all have antimicrobial activity. However, they differ with respect to conformational mobility, hydrophobic characteristics, and overall charge. In this work, using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that the peptides adopt an α-helical conformation upon interaction with either PSA or phospholipid liposomes formed of either zwitterionic or anionic phospholipids or their mixtures. The extent of helicity depends on the amino acid sequence and properties of the medium. Based on small angle X-ray scattering data and the analysis of the fluorescence spectrum of the Trp residue in Mlt, we conclude that the peptide forms an oligomeric complex consisting of α-helical Mlt and several PSA molecules. Both latarcins, unlike Mlt, the most hydrophobic of the peptides, interact weakly with zwitterionic liposomes. However, they bind anionic liposomes or those composed of anionic/zwitterionic lipid mixtures. Latarcin Ltc1K forms associates on liposomes composed of zwitterionic/anionic lipid mixture. The structure of the peptide associates is either disordered or of β-sheet conformation. In all other cases the studied peptides adopt predominately α-helical conformation. In addition, we demonstrate that PSA inhibits membranolytic activity of Mlt and latarcin Ltc1K. These data suggest that the peptides, due to their high conformational lability, can vary structural and amphiphilic properties in the presence of PSA. As a result, various scenarios of the interaction of the peptides with membranes, whose surface is abundant with anionic polysaccharides, can take place. This can account for difficulties in understanding the structure-functional relationships in interactions of linear cationic peptides with biological membranes. © 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","circular dichroism; cytolytic peptides; latarcins; linear cationic peptides; melittin; phospholipid liposomes; sialic acid","antimicrobial cationic peptide; cation; latarcin 2a, Lachesana tarabaevi; lipid bilayer; liposome; Ltc1 peptide, Lachesana tarabaevi; melittin; peptide; phospholipid; polysialic acid; protein binding; sialic acid derivative; spider venom; amino acid sequence; chemical phenomena; chemistry; circular dichroism; lipid bilayer; metabolism; molecular genetics; protein secondary structure; Amino Acid Sequence; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Cations; Circular Dichroism; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Lipid Bilayers; Liposomes; Melitten; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptides; Phospholipids; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Sialic Acids; Spider Venoms","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901021336

We show that the instability of women's work status (i.e., the holding of occasional and precarious jobs) significantly discourages the decision to attempt having a first child. Low levels of household wealth significantly and positively influence the decision to postpone attempting a first child.

For any complex simple Lie group G and any characteristic class the moduli space of flat connections is defined, and for them the monodromy-preserving deformation equations are given in Hamiltonian form together with the corresponding Lax representation.

This could allow for a better integration of inclusive, long-term visions in decision-making and strategic thinking in the context of innovation.

The effect of the long-range Coulomb repulsion in an ensemble of Dirac fermions on the formation of the superconducting pairing in a monolayer is studied in the framework of the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. The electronic structure of graphene is described in the strong coupling Wannier representation on the hexagonal lattice. We use the Shubin-Vonsowsky model which takes into account the intra- and intersite Coulomb repulsions of electrons. The Cooper instability is established by solving the Bethe-Salpeter integral equation, in which the role of the effective interaction is played by the renormalized scattering amplitude. The renormalized amplitude contains the Kohn-Luttinger polarization contributions up to and including the second-order terms in the Coulomb repulsion. We construct the superconductive phase diagram for the idealized graphene monolayer and show that the Kohn-Luttinger renormalizations and the intersite Coulomb repulsion significantly affect the interplay between the superconducting phases with f-, d+id-, and p+ip-wave symmetries of the order parameter. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","A.

Movement onsets were derived from the accelerometer signal.

Independent components that demonstrated maximum relation to the linger movement were averaged relative to the movement onset. The results of the distributed brain source modeling of the two independent components that manifested maximum amount of mutual information has demonstrated that their sources localize in the cortical areas corresponding to anatomical markers of hand representation in the primary motor and the primary sensory cortices contralateral to the movement.

Because of the excellent characteristics and the possibility to be effectively coupled to singlemode optical fiber many applications of the SSPD have already been reported. The most impressive one is the quantum key distribution (QKD) over 250 km distance. This demonstration shows further possibilities for the improvement of the characteristics of quantum-cryptographic systems such as increasing the bit rate and the quantum channel length, and decreasing the quantum bit error rate (QBER). This improvement is possible because SSPDs have the best characteristics in comparison with other single-photon detectors. We have demonstrated the possibility of polarization state reconstruction and measurement over 302.5 km with superconducting single-photon detectors. The advantage of an autocompensating optical scheme, also known as ""plug&play"" for quantum key distribution, is high stability in the presence of distortions along the line. To increase the distance of quantum key distribution with this optical scheme we implement the superconducting single photon detectors (SSPD). At the 5 MHz pulse repetition frequency and the average photon number equal to 0.4 we measured a 33 bit/s quantum key generation for a 101.7 km single mode ber quantum channel. The extremely low SSPD dark count rate allowed us to keep QBER at 1.6% level. © 2014 SPIE.","Quantum communication; Quantum cryptography; Quantum key distribution; Superconducting Single-Photon Detectors","Avalanche photodiodes; Bit error rate; Communication channels (information theory); Cryptography; Nanoelectronics; Optical communication; Optical fibers; Particle beams; Photodetectors; Photons; Polarization; Quantum communication; Quantum entanglement; Cryptographic systems; Polarization state; Pulse repetition frequencies; Quantum bit error rate; Quantum key-generation; Single-mode optical fiber; Single-photon detectors; Superconducting single-photon detectors; Quantum cryptography","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923113801

Both bonuses and penalties boost efficiency, strongly increasing effort in the contractible task while only mildly crowding it out in the non-contractible one. However, sellers grab a higher fraction of surplus with bonuses, as buyers' offers become more generous. Consequently, buyers prefer penalties, which may explain why they are so widespread in procurement.

Muthén and Asparouhov recently proposed a new approach to test for approximate rather than exact measurement invariance using Bayesian MGCFA. Approximate measurement invariance permits small differences between parameters otherwise constrained to be equal in the classical exact approach. However, extant knowledge about how results of approximate measurement invariance tests compare to the results of the exact measurement invariance test is missing. We address this gap by comparing the results of exact and approximate cross-country measurement invariance tests of a revised scale to measure human values. Several studies that measured basic human values with the Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) reported problems of measurement noninvariance (especially scalar noninvariance) across countries. Recently Schwartz et al. proposed a refined value theory and an instrument (PVQ-5X) to measure 19 more narrowly defined values. Cieciuch et al. tested its measurement invariance properties across eight countries and established exact scalar measurement invariance for 10 of the 19 values. The current study applied the approximate measurement invariance procedure on the same data and established approximate scalar measurement invariance even for all 19 values. Thus, the first conclusion is that the approximate approach provides more encouraging results for the usefulness of the scale for cross-cultural research, although this finding needs to be generalized and validated in future research using population data. The second conclusion is that the approximate measurement invariance is more likely than the exact approach to establish measurement invariance, although further simulation studies are needed to determine more precise recommendations about how large the permissible variance of the priors may be. © 2014.","Approximate measurement invariance; Bayesian analysis; Configural metric scalar measurement invariance; Exact measurement invariance; Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis; Revised Portrait Values Questionnaire",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906333717

Previous data on the effects of these factors are equivocal, possibly due to language- and task-specific factors.Aims: The present study aimed to investigate the nature of the instrumentality and verb-noun name relation effects by retesting them in a large sample of Russian-speaking individuals with fluent and non-fluent aphasia.Methods & Procedures: Forty Russian-speaking individuals with aphasia (twenty with fluent and twenty with non-fluent aphasia) and twenty controls performed an action naming task. Overall accuracy scores and qualitative error types were analysed.Outcomes & Results: A positive effect of instrumentality was found in both groups of individuals with aphasia. A negative effect of verb-noun name relation was found in non-fluent aphasia and was larger for verbs with a smaller overlap with the instrument noun. In both aphasia groups, semantically related errors were more numerous for non-instrumental than instrumental verbs, whereas phonological errors were more numerous for name-related than non-name-related instrumental verbs.Conclusions: The positive effect of instrumentality on verb retrieval may be attributed to a facilitatory effect of richer conceptual representations of instrumental verbs. The negative effect of name relation on verb retrieval may be explained by interference of the phonological form of the instrument noun. These factors influence verb retrieval in aphasia and should be taken into account when developing testing/treatment materials and stimuli for experimental studies. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Aphasia; Instrumentality; Russian; Verb-finding difficulties; Verb-noun name relation",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905734278

The search structure is based on a navigable small world graph with vertices corresponding to the stored elements, edges to links between them, and a variation of greedy algorithm for searching. The navigable small world is created simply by keeping old Delaunay graph approximation links produced at the start of construction. The approach is very universal, defined in terms of arbitrary metric spaces and at the same time it is very simple. The algorithm handles insertions in the same way as queries: by finding approximate neighbors for the inserted element and connecting it to them. Both search and insertion can be done in parallel requiring only local information from the structure. The structure can be made distributed. The accuracy of the probabilistic k-nearest neighbor queries can be adjusted without rebuilding the structure. The performed simulation for data in the Euclidean spaces shows that the structure built using the proposed algorithm has small world navigation properties with log2(n) insertion and search complexity at fixed accuracy, and performs well at high dimensionality. Simulation on a CoPHiR dataset revealed its high efficiency in case of large datasets (more than an order of magnitude less metric computations at fixed recall) compared to permutation indexes. Only 0.03% of the 10 million 208-dimensional vector dataset is needed to be evaluated to achieve 0.999 recall (virtually exact search).

It provides an alternative (to the nested Bethe ansatz) method for computation of spectra of the spin chains. Namely, the spectrum of the quantum transfer matrix for the inhomogeneous gl n -invariant XXX spin chain on N sites with twisted boundary conditions can be found in terms of velocities of particles in the rational N -body Ruijsenaars-Schneider model. The possible values of the velocities are to be found from intersection points of two Lagrangian submanifolds in the phase space of the classical model. One of them is the Lagrangian hyperplane corresponding to fixed coordinates of all N particles and the other one is an N -dimensional Lagrangian submanifold obtained by fixing levels of N classical Hamiltonians in involution. The latter are determined by eigenvalues of the twist matrix. To support this picture, we give a direct proof that the eigenvalues of the Lax matrix for the classical Ruijsenaars-Schneider model, where velocities of particles are substituted by eigenvalues of the spin chain Hamiltonians, calculated through the Bethe equations, coincide with eigenvalues of the twist matrix, with certain multiplicities.

The Dolev-Yao adversaries can compose, decompose, eavesdrop, and intercept messages, and create fresh values (nonces), but within their bounded memory. We prove that the secrecy problem is PSPACE-complete in the bounded memory model where all actions are balanced and a potentially infinite number of the nonce updates is allowed. We also show that the well-known security protocol anomalies (starting from the Lowe attack to the Needham-Schroeder protocol) can be rephrased within the bounded memory paradigm with the explicit memory bounds. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We showed that this Bounded Memory Dolev-Yao adversary, when given enough memory, can carry out many existing protocol anomalies.

Actual noise affecting seismic sensors during hydraulic fracturing is non-stationary. It is correlated in time and space, and varies greatly in power and spectral content for different sensors of the array. We use Monte Carlo simulation to show that the location accuracy of statistically optimal algorithms can be 20 to 40 times better than for the Seismic Emission Tomography algorithm in the presence of man-made surface noise during hydraulic fracturing. © 2014 European Association of Geoscientists & Engineers.","Accuracy; Correlated noise; Microseismic; Passive surface; Statistical","Algorithms; Gaussian noise (electronic); Hydraulic fracturing; Monte Carlo methods; Sensors; Surface properties; Tomography; White noise; Accuracy; Correlated noise; Microseismic; Passive surfaces; Statistical; Seismology; accuracy assessment; algorithm; Gaussian method; hydraulic fracture; maximum likelihood analysis; microearthquake; monitoring system; Monte Carlo analysis; seismic source; seismic tomography; signal-to-noise ratio","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902344048

The agents' conjectures concern the price variations depending upon their production output increase or decrease. We establish the existence and uniqueness results for the CVE (called exterior equilibrium) for any set of feasible conjectures. To introduce the notion of interior equilibrium, we develop a consistency criterion for the conjectures (referred to as influence coefficients) and prove the existence theorem for the interior equilibrium (understood as CVE with consistent conjectures, or CCVE). In addition, we also examine the behavior of the consistent conjectures as functions of a parameter representing the demand's derivative with respect to the market price. The latter results allow one to predict the behavior of groups of consumers with different consumption abilities. The proposed techniques permit one to develop a qualitative description of the dependence of the market price on the active demand component, too. It should be noticed that due to the non-smoothness of the demand function, there is possibly a path dependency and indeterminacy of equilibria in certain cases. This is, on the one hand, a theoretically inconvenient result (multiple equilibria), but on the other hand, it may happen to be extremely useful for applications. Indeed, the latter multiplicity of equilibria might serve as a rationale for the regulatory intervention to induce a change of equilibrium whenever the total welfare could be improved (cf., for example, the Keynesian stimulus). © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Active demand; Conjectural variations equilibrium; Consistent conjectures; Game theory; Non-continuous demand function",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902009295

The heroic, expedition-based style of Arctic science, dominant in the first decades of the twentieth century, gave way to a systematic, long-term, strategic and largely statefunded model of research which increased both Arctic presence and the volume of research output. Factors that made this change possible were distinct for each of the five circumpolar nation-states considered here. For Soviet leaders, the Arctic was an untamed land containing vast economic resources, all within reach if its long-sought Northern Sea Route became reality; Soviet officials sought environmental knowledge of this region with a range of motivations from economic and strategic concerns to enhancing the prestige of socialism. In contrast, United States officials largely ignored the Arctic until the outbreak of World War II, when military commanders quickly grasped the strategic importance of this region. Anxious that the Arctic might become a literal battleground between East and West by 1947, as the Cold War began, Pentagon leaders funded vast northern research programs, including in strategically located Greenland. Canadian leaders-while appreciating the national security concerns of its powerful southern neighbor-were even more concerned with maintaining sovereignty over its northern territories and gaining knowledge to assist its northern economic ambitions. Norway and Sweden, as smaller states, faced distinct challenges. With strong claims to Arctic heritage but limited resources, leaders of these states sought to create independent research strategies while, especially in the case of Norway, protecting their geopolitical interests in relation to the Soviet Union and the U.S. This article provides the first internationally comparative study of the multiple economic, military, political, and strategic factors that motivated scientific activities and programs in the far north, from the interwar period through World War II and the Cold War, when carefully coordinated, station-based research programs were introduced. The production of knowledge about Arctic's physical environment-including its changing climate-had little resemblance either to ideas of science-based 'progress,' or responses to perceived environmental concerns. Instead, it demonstrates that strategic military, economic, geopolitical, and national security concerns influenced and shaped most science undertakings, including those of the International Polar Year of 1932-1933 and the following polar year, the International Geophysical Year of 1957-1958. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Arctic; Canada; Cold War; Environment; IGY; IPY; Norway; Polar; Science; Soviet Union; Sweden; United States",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901414063

However, there are few data on such possible interactions. Methods: We analyzed day-to-day variations in the number of deaths in Moscow, Russia, in relation to air pollution levels and temperature during the disastrous heat wave and wildfire of 2010. Corresponding data for the period 2006-2009 were used for comparison. Daily average levels of PM10 and ozone were obtained from several continuous measurement stations. The daily number of nonaccidental deaths from specific causes was extracted from official records. Analyses of interactions considered the main effect of temperature as well as the added effect of prolonged high temperatures and the interaction with PM10. Results: The major heat wave lasted for 44 days, with 24-hour average temperatures ranging from 24°C to 31°C and PM10 levels exceeding 300 μg/m on several days. There were close to 11,000 excess deaths from nonaccidental causes during this period, mainly among those older than 65 years. Increased risks also occurred in younger age groups. The most pronounced effects were for deaths from cardiovascular, respiratory, genitourinary, and nervous system diseases. Continuously increasing risks following prolonged high temperatures were apparent during the first 2 weeks of the heat wave. Interactions between high temperatures and air pollution from wildfires in excess of an additive effect contributed to more than 2000 deaths. ConclusionS: Interactions between high temperatures and wildfire air pollution should be considered in risk assessments regarding health consequences of climate change.

This family models the Josephson effect in superconductivity. We study its rotation number as a function of the parameters and the Arnold tongues (also known as the phase locking domains) defined as the level sets of the rotation number that have nonempty interior. The Arnold tongues of this family of equations have a number of nontypical properties: they exist only for integer values of the rotation number, and the boundaries of the tongues are given by analytic curves. (These results were obtained by Buchstaber-Karpov-Tertychnyi and Ilyashenko-Ryzhov-Filimonov.) The tongue width is zero at the points of intersection of the boundary curves, which results in adjacency points. Numerical experiments and theoretical studies carried out by Buchstaber-Karpov-Tertychnyi and Klimenko-Romaskevich show that each Arnold tongue forms an infinite chain of adjacent domains separated by adjacency points and going to infinity in an asymptotically vertical direction. Recent numerical experiments have also shown that for each Arnold tongue all of its adjacency points lie on one and the same vertical line with integer abscissa equal to the corresponding rotation number. In the present paper, we prove this fact for an open set of two-parameter families of equations in question. In the general case, we prove a weaker claim: the abscissa of each adjacency point is an integer, has the same sign as the rotation number, and does not exceed the latter in absolute value. The proof is based on the representation of the differential equations in question as projectivizations of linear differential equations on the Riemann sphere and the classical theory of linear equations with complex time. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Arnold tongue; irregular singularity; Josephson effect in superconductivity; linear ordinary differential equation with complex time; monodromy; ordinary differential equation on the torus; rotation number; Stokes operator",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919424365

A similar result, Theorem 1.1, is also established for unitarily invariant measures on the space of all infinite complex matrices. These results imply that the infinite Hua-Pickrell measures of Borodin and Olshanski have finite ergodic components. The proof is based on the approach of Olshanski and Vershik. First, it is shown that if the sequence of orbital measures assigned to almost every point is weakly precompact, then our ergodic measure must indeed be finite. The second step, which completes the proof, shows that if a unitarily-invariant measure admits well-defined projections onto the quotient space of finite corners, then for almost every point the corresponding sequence of orbital measures is indeed weakly precompact.","Classification of ergodic measures; Hua-Pickrell measures; Infinite-dimensional Lie groups; Orbital measures; Weak compactness",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918832726

However, not all syntactic processes are equally problematic: present time reference, who questions, and reflexives can be processed by narrow syntax alone and are relatively spared compared to past time reference, which questions, and personal pronouns, respectively. The latter need additional access to discourse and information structures to link to their referent outside the clause (Avrutin, 2006). Linguistic processing that requires discourse-linking is difficult for agrammatic individuals: verb morphology with reference to the past is more difficult than with reference to the present (Bastiaanse et al., 2011). The same holds for which questions compared to who questions and for pronouns compared to reflexives (Avrutin, 2006). These results have been reported independently for different populations in different languages. The current study, for the first time, tested all conditions within the same population. Aims: We had two aims with the current study. First, we wanted to investigate whether discourse-linking is the common denominator of the deficits in time reference, wh questions, and object pronouns. Second, we aimed to compare the comprehension of discourse-linked elements in people with agrammatic and fluent aphasia. Methods and procedures: Three sentence-picture-matching tasks were administered to 10 agrammatic, 10 fluent aphasic, and 10 non-brain-damaged Russian speakers (NBDs): (1) the Test for Assessing Reference of Time (TART) for present imperfective (reference to present) and past perfective (reference to past), (2) the Wh Extraction Assessment Tool (WHEAT) for which and who subject questions, and (3) the Reflexive-Pronoun Test (RePro) for reflexive and pronominal reference. Outcomes and results: NBDs scored at ceiling and significantly higher than the aphasic participants. We found an overall effect of discourse-linking in the TART and WHEAT for the agrammatic speakers, and in all three tests for the fluent speakers. Scores on the RePro were at ceiling. Conclusions: The results are in line with the prediction that problems that individuals with agrammatic and fluent aphasia experience when comprehending sentences that contain verbs with past time reference, which question words and pronouns are caused by the fact that these elements involve discourse linking. The effect is not specific to agrammatism, although it may result from different underlying disorders in agrammatic and fluent aphasia. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Aphasia; Discourse-linking; Pronouns; Sentence comprehension; Tense; Time reference; Wh Questions","adult; aged; agrammatic aphasia; aphasia; article; clinical article; comprehension; controlled study; discourse analysis; female; fluent aphasia; human; language processing; male; middle aged; Russian Federation; aphasia; neuropsychological test; pathophysiology; physiology; psychology; reference value; semantics; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aphasia; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Reference Values; Russia; Semantics; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896656870

They rely on the electromagnetic field associated with photons to carry information from one point to another in space. A complete physical model of these channels must necessarily take quantum effects into account to determine their ultimate performances. Single-mode, phase-insensitive bosonic Gaussian channels have been extensively studied over past decades, given their importance for practical applications. In spite of this, a long-standing unsolved conjecture on the optimality of Gaussian encodings has prevented finding their classical communication capacity. Here, this conjecture is solved by proving that the vacuum state achieves the minimum output entropy of these channels. This establishes the ultimate achievable bit rate under an energy constraint, as well as the long awaited proof that the single-letter classical capacity of these channels is additive. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Building multi-label classifiers for the automated annotation of articles into topics can support the work of human annotators by suggesting a list of all topics by order of relevance, or even automate the annotation process for media and/or categories that are easier to predict.

The Affective Attachment and Deference subscales demonstrated full metric invariance whereas the Personal-Life Inclusion subscale was found to have partial metric invariance across all eight samples. Structural equation modeling revealed that the affective attachment dimension had a cross-nationally invariant positive relationship to affective organizational commitment and a negative relationship to turnover intention. The deference to the supervisor dimension had invariant positive relationships with both affective and normative organizational commitment. The personal-life inclusion dimension was unrelated to all outcomes. These results indicate the relevance of aspects of guanxi to superior-subordinate relations in non-Chinese cultures.

Although researchers have compared cohabitation cross-nationally using quantitative data, few have compared union formation using qualitative data. Objective: We use focus group research to compare social norms of cohabitation and marriage in Australia and nine countries in Europe. We explore questions such as: what is the meaning of cohabitation? To what extent is cohabitation indistinguishable from marriage, a prelude to marriage, or an alternative to being single? Are the meanings of cohabitation similar across countries? Methods: Collaborators conducted seven to eight focus groups in each country using a standardized guideline. They analyzed the discussions with bottom-up coding in each thematic area. They then collated the data in a standardized report. The first and second authors systematically analyzed the reports, with direct input from collaborators. Results: The results describe a specific picture of union formation in each country. However, three themes emerge in all focus groups: commitment, testing, and freedom. The pervasiveness of these concepts suggests that marriage and cohabitation have distinct meanings, with marriage representing a stronger level of commitment. Cohabitation is a way to test the relationship, and represents freedom. Nonetheless, other discourses emerged, suggesting that cohabitation has multiple meanings. Conclusions: This study illuminates how context shapes partnership formation, but also presents underlying reasons for the development of cohabitation. We find that the increase in cohabitation has not devalued the concept of marriage, but has become a way to preserve marriage as an ideal for long-term commitment.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84920273196

What might be the source of coherence? We view political values as expressions, in the political domain, of more basic personal values. Basic personal values (e.g., security, achievement, benevolence, hedonism) are organized on a circular continuum that reflects their conflicting and compatible motivations. We theorize that this circular motivational structure also gives coherence to political values. We assess this theorizing with data from 15 countries, using eight core political values (e.g., free enterprise, law and order) and ten basic personal values. We specify the underlying basic values expected to promote or oppose each political value. We offer different hypotheses for the 12 non-communist and three post-communist countries studied, where the political context suggests different meanings of a basic or political value. Correlation and regression analyses support almost all hypotheses. Moreover, basic values account for substantially more variance in political values than age, gender, education, and income. Multidimensional scaling analyses demonstrate graphically how the circular motivational continuum of basic personal values structures relations among core political values.

The short version of ZTPI will further promote integration of research in the time perspective domain in relation to many different psycho-social processes. © The Author(s) 2014.","Cross-cultural research; Equivalence; Time perspective; Zimbardo time perspective inventory; ZTPI",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84901350509

The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. Comparable, up-to-date information about levels and trends is essential to quantify population health effects and to prompt decision makers to prioritise action. We estimate the global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980-2013. Methods We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n=1769) that included data for height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. We used mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. We obtained data for prevalence of obesity and overweight by age, sex, country, and year (n=19 244) with a spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Findings Worldwide, the proportion of adults with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m 2 or greater increased between 1980 and 2013 from 28·8% (95% UI 28·4-29·3) to 36·9% (36·3-37·4) in men, and from 29·8% (29·3- 30·2) to 38·0% (37·5-38·5) in women. Prevalence has increased substantially in children and adolescents in developed countries; 23·8% (22·9-24·7) of boys and 22·6% (21·7-23·6) of girls were overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and obesity has also increased in children and adolescents in developing countries, from 8·1% (7·7-8·6) to 12·9% (12·3-13·5) in 2013 for boys and from 8·4% (8·1-8·8) to 13·4% (13·0-13·9) in girls. In adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeded 50% in men in Tonga and in women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has slowed down. Interpretation Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, obesity has become a major global health challenge. Not only is obesity increasing, but no national success stories have been reported in the past 33 years. Urgent global action and leadership is needed to help countries to more effectively intervene.

regional, and national levels of neonatal, infant, and under-5 mortality during 1990-2013: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013",2014,"The

financial and political efforts have been focused on the reduction of child mortality during the past few decades. Timely measurements of levels and trends in under-5 mortality are important to assess progress towards the Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG 4) target of reduction of child mortality by two thirds from 1990 to 2015, and to identify models of success. Methods: We generated updated estimates of child mortality in early neonatal (age 0-6 days), late neonatal (7-28 days), postneonatal (29-364 days), childhood (1-4 years), and under-5 (0-4 years) age groups for 188 countries from 1970 to 2013, with more than 29 000 survey, census, vital registration, and sample registration datapoints. We used Gaussian process regression with adjustments for bias and non-sampling error to synthesise the data for under-5 mortality for each country, and a separate model to estimate mortality for more detailed age groups. We used explanatory mixed effects regression models to assess the association between under-5 mortality and income per person, maternal education, HIV child death rates, secular shifts, and other factors. To quantify the contribution of these different factors and birth numbers to the change in numbers of deaths in under-5 age groups from 1990 to 2013, we used Shapley decomposition. We used estimated rates of change between 2000 and 2013 to construct under-5 mortality rate scenarios out to 2030. Findings: We estimated that 6·3 million (95% UI 6·0-6·6) children under-5 died in 2013, a 64% reduction from 17·6 million (17·1-18·1) in 1970. In 2013, child mortality rates ranged from 152·5 per 1000 livebirths (130·6-177·4) in Guinea-Bissau to 2·3 (1·8-2·9) per 1000 in Singapore. The annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2013 ranged from -6·8% to 0·1%. 99 of 188 countries, including 43 of 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, had faster decreases in child mortality during 2000-13 than during 1990-2000. In 2013, neonatal deaths accounted for 41·6% of under-5 deaths compared with 37·4% in 1990. Compared with 1990, in 2013, rising numbers of births, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, led to 1·4 million more child deaths, and rising income per person and maternal education led to 0·9 million and 2·2 million fewer deaths, respectively. Changes in secular trends led to 4·2 million fewer deaths. Unexplained factors accounted for only -1% of the change in child deaths. In 30 developing countries, decreases since 2000 have been faster than predicted attributable to income, education, and secular shift alone. Interpretation: Only 27 developing countries are expected to achieve MDG 4. Decreases since 2000 in under-5 mortality rates are accelerating in many developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The Millennium Declaration and increased development assistance for health might have been a factor in faster decreases in some developing countries. Without further accelerated progress, many countries in west and central Africa will still have high levels of under-5 mortality in 2030.",,"Africa south of the Sahara; age distribution; Article; child; childhood mortality; developing country; educational status; Guinea-Bissau; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; income; infant; infant mortality; live birth; major clinical study; mother; newborn; newborn mortality; priority journal; secularism; Singapore; trend study; article; health; multicenter study; organization; preschool child; risk factor; socioeconomics; statistics; Child Mortality; Child, Preschool; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Organizational Objectives; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; World Health","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904972811

Declaration in 2000 brought special global attention to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria through the formulation of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6. The Global Burden of Disease 2013 study provides a consistent and comprehensive approach to disease estimation for between 1990 and 2013, and an opportunity to assess whether accelerated progress has occured since the Millennium Declaration. Methods To estimate incidence and mortality for HIV, we used the UNAIDS Spectrum model appropriately modifi ed based on a systematic review of available studies of mortality with and without antiretroviral therapy (ART). For concentrated epidemics, we calibrated Spectrum models to fi t vital registration data corrected for misclassifi cation of HIV deaths. In generalised epidemics, we minimised a loss function to select epidemic curves most consistent with prevalence data and demographic data for all-cause mortality. We analysed counterfactual scenarios for HIV to assess years of life saved through prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and ART. For tuberculosis, we analysed vital registration and verbal autopsy data to estimate mortality using cause of death ensemble modelling. We analysed data for corrected case-notifi cations, expert opinions on the case-detection rate, prevalence surveys, and estimated cause-specifi c mortality using Bayesian meta-regression to generate consistent trends in all parameters. We analysed malaria mortality and incidence using an updated cause of death database, a systematic analysis of verbal autopsy validation studies for malaria, and recent studies (2010-13) of incidence, drug resistance, and coverage of insecticide-treated bednets. Findings Globally in 2013, there were 1·8 million new HIV infections (95% uncertainty interval 1·7 million to 2·1 million), 29·2 million prevalent HIV cases (28·1 to 31·7), and 1·3 million HIV deaths (1·3 to 1·5). At the peak of the epidemic in 2005, HIV caused 1·7 million deaths (1·6 million to 1·9 million). Concentrated epidemics in Latin America and eastern Europe are substantially smaller than previously estimated. Through interventions including PMTCT and ART, 19·1 million life-years (16·6 million to 21·5 million) have been saved, 70·3% (65·4 to 76·1) in developing countries. From 2000 to 2011, the ratio of development assistance for health for HIV to years of life saved through intervention was US$4498 in developing countries. Including in HIV-positive individuals, all-form tuberculosis incidence was 7·5 million (7·4 million to 7·7 million), prevalence was 11·9 million (11·6 million to 12·2 million), and number of deaths was 1·4 million (1·3 million to 1·5 million) in 2013. In the same year and in only individuals who were HIV-negative, all-form tuberculosis incidence was 7·1 million (6·9 million to 7·3 million), prevalence was 11·2 million (10·8 million to 11·6 million), and number of deaths was 1·3 million (1·2 million to 1·4 million). Annualised rates of change (ARC) for incidence, prevalence, and death became negative after 2000. Tuberculosis in HIV-negative individuals disproportionately occurs in men and boys (versus women and girls); 64·0% of cases (63·6 to 64·3) and 64·7% of deaths (60·8 to 70·3). Globally, malaria cases and deaths grew rapidly from 1990 reaching a peak of 232 million cases (143 million to 387 million) in 2003 and 1·2 million deaths (1·1 million to 1·4 million) in 2004. Since 2004, child deaths from malaria in sub-Saharan Africa have decreased by 31·5% (15·7 to 44·1). Outside of Africa, malaria mortality has been steadily decreasing since 1990. Interpretation Our estimates of the number of people living with HIV are 18·7% smaller than UNAIDS's estimates in 2012. The number of people living with malaria is larger than estimated by WHO. Incidence rates for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria have all decreased since 2000. At the global level, upward trends for malaria and HIV deaths have been reversed and declines in tuberculosis deaths have accelerated. 101 countries (74 of which are developing) still have increasing HIV incidence. Substantial progress since the Millennium Declaration is an encouraging sign of the effect of global action.
