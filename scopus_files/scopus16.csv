How does the socratic daimon (daimonion) become a metaphor in Arendt's philosophy? What functions does his image play in Arendt's concepts of action and thinking?

The drive gives rise to a convective (but not absolute) instability in the system. The resulting NLSE includes a pseudo-stimulated-Raman-scattering (pseudo-SRS) term, which is a spatial-domain counterpart of the SRS term, a well-known ingredient of the temporal-domain NLSE in optics. Analysis of the field-momentum balance and direct simulations demonstrates that wave-number downshift by the pseudo-SRS may be compensated by the upshift induced by the wind traction, thus maintaining robust bright solitons in both stationary and oscillatory forms; in particular, they are not destroyed by the underlying convective instability. Analytical soliton solutions are found in an approximate form and are verified by numerical simulations.

It has been shown that almost t-IPP codes of nonvanishing rate exist for the case t = 2. Surprisingly enough, collusion secure digital fingerprinting codes do not automatically possess this almost IPP property. In practice, this means that for a given forged fingerprint, say z, a user identified as guilty by the tracing algorithm can deny this claim since he will be able to present a coalition of users that can create the same z, but he does not belong to that coalition.

It is essential to find out (1) which rules and mechanisms exist in this type of economy; (2) what motivates people who are not acquainted with another to exchange gifts; and (3) understand the way this community exists. The conclusion is drawn that social capital is the basic engine of investigated communities. The social capital accumulated by users increases the community commitment and cohesion by interpreting gifts as a set of resources to distribute fairly. The giving, the receiving and the exchanging are forms of communication that cause further communication and interworking outside of giftgiving situations.

Here, we studied these adjustments by analyzing post-error modulations of alpha and theta band activity in the auditory version of the two-choice condensation task, which is highly demanding for sustained attention while involves no inhibition of prepotent responses. Errors were followed by increased frontal midline theta (FMT) activity, as well as by enhanced alpha band suppression in the parietal and the left central regions; parietal alpha suppression correlated with the task performance, left central alpha suppression correlated with the post-error slowing, and FMT increase correlated with both behavioral measures. On post-error correct trials, left-central alpha band suppression started earlier before the response, and the response was followed by weaker FMT activity, as well as by enhanced alpha band suppression distributed over the entire scalp. These findings indicate that several separate neuronal networks are involved in post-error adjustments, including the midfrontal performance monitoring network, the parietal attentional network, and the sensorimotor network. Supposedly, activity within these networks is rapidly modulated after errors, resulting in optimization of their functional state on the subsequent trials, with corresponding changes in behavioral measures. © 2015 Novikov, Bryzgalov and Chernyshev.","Alpha oscillations; Cognitive control; Errors; Post-error trials; Posterror adaptations; Theta oscillations; Time-frequency decomposition","attention; error; modulation; monitoring; nerve cell network; scalp; task performance; theta rhythm","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954058429

of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factor study 2013 (GBD 2013) is the first of a series of annual updates of the GBD. Risk factor quantification, particularly of modifiable risk factors, can help to identify emerging threats to population health and opportunities for prevention. The GBD 2013 provides a timely opportunity to update the comparative risk assessment with new data for exposure, relative risks, and evidence on the appropriate counterfactual risk distribution. Methods: Attributable deaths, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) have been estimated for 79 risks or clusters of risks using the GBD 2010 methods. Risk-outcome pairs meeting explicit evidence criteria were assessed for 188 countries for the period 1990-2013 by age and sex using three inputs: risk exposure, relative risks, and the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). Risks are organised into a hierarchy with blocks of behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks at the first level of the hierarchy. The next level in the hierarchy includes nine clusters of related risks and two individual risks, with more detail provided at levels 3 and 4 of the hierarchy. Compared with GBD 2010, six new risk factors have been added: handwashing practices, occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, childhood wasting, childhood stunting, unsafe sex, and low glomerular filtration rate. For most risks, data for exposure were synthesised with a Bayesian metaregression method, DisMod-MR 2.0, or spatial-temporal Gaussian process regression. Relative risks were based on meta-regressions of published cohort and intervention studies. Attributable burden for clusters of risks and all risks combined took into account evidence on the mediation of some risks such as high body-mass index (BMI) through other risks such as high systolic blood pressure and high cholesterol. Findings: All risks combined account for 57·2% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 55·8-58·5) of deaths and 41·6% (40·1-43·0) of DALYs. Risks quantified account for 87·9% (86·5-89·3) of cardiovascular disease DALYs, ranging to a low of 0% for neonatal disorders and neglected tropical diseases and malaria. In terms of global DALYs in 2013, six risks or clusters of risks each caused more than 5% of DALYs: dietary risks accounting for 11·3 million deaths and 241·4 million DALYs, high systolic blood pressure for 10·4 million deaths and 208·1 million DALYs, child and maternal malnutrition for 1·7 million deaths and 176·9 million DALYs, tobacco smoke for 6·1 million deaths and 143·5 million DALYs, air pollution for 5·5 million deaths and 141·5 million DALYs, and high BMI for 4·4 million deaths and 134·0 million DALYs. Risk factor patterns vary across regions and countries and with time. In sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risk factors are child and maternal malnutrition, unsafe sex, and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing. In women, in nearly all countries in the Americas, north Africa, and the Middle East, and in many other high-income countries, high BMI is the leading risk factor, with high systolic blood pressure as the leading risk in most of Central and Eastern Europe and south and east Asia. For men, high systolic blood pressure or tobacco use are the leading risks in nearly all high-income countries, in north Africa and the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. For men and women, unsafe sex is the leading risk in a corridor from Kenya to South Africa. Interpretation: Behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks can explain half of global mortality and more than one-third of global DALYs providing many opportunities for prevention. Of the larger risks, the attributable burden of high BMI has increased in the past 23 years. In view of the prominence of behavioural risk factors, behavioural and social science research on interventions for these risks should be strengthened. Many prevention and primary care policy options are available now to act on key risks.",,"tobacco smoke; trichloroethylene; Africa south of the Sahara; Bayes theorem; body mass; cardiovascular disease; Central European; comparative study; disability; disability adjusted life years; East Asian; Eastern Europe; environmental exposure; female; glomerulus filtration rate; hand washing; human; hypercholesterolemia; Kenya; male; malnutrition; Middle East; newborn disease; North America; occupational exposure; occupational hazard; priority journal; quality of life assessment; Review; risk assessment; sanitation; South Africa; stunting; systolic blood pressure; unsafe sex; water supply; years of life lost","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049491557

In practice original high-dimensional data are transformed into lower-dimensional representations (features) preserving certain subject-driven data properties such as distances or geodesic distances, angles, etc. Preserving as much as possible available information contained in the original high-dimensional data is also an important and desirable property of the representation. The real-world high-dimensional data typically lie on or near a certain unknown low-dimensional manifold (Data manifold) embedded in an ambient high-dimensional 'observation' space, so in this article we assume this Manifold assumption to be fulfilled. An exact isometric manifold embedding in a low-dimensional space is possible in certain special cases only, so we consider the problem of constructing a 'locally isometric and conformal' embedding, which preserves distances and angles between close points. We propose a new geometrically motivated locally isometric and conformal representation method, which employs Tangent Manifold Learning technique consisting in sample-based estimation of tangent spaces to the unknown Data manifold. In numerical experiments, the proposed method compares favourably with popular Manifold Learning methods in terms of isometric and conformal embedding properties as well as of accuracy of Data manifold reconstruction from the sample. © 2015 IEEE.","Conformal embedding; Dimensionality Reduction; High Dimensional Data; Isometric embedding; Low Dimensional Features; Manifold Learning; Tangent Manifold Learning","Clustering algorithms; Learning systems; Numerical methods; Conformal embedding; Dimensionality reduction; High dimensional data; Isometric embeddings; Low dimensional; Manifold learning; Data mining","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962909326

The authors choose Russia as an illustrative case of an economy in the changing geopolitical context to review major trends of global value chains’ development, specific features of Russia’s participation in them, and the necessary steps to increase the quality and efficiency of this participation. Special attention was paid to theoretical, methodological, and empirical tools of GVC research and of making relevant political decisions—which presently are far from being adequate: they need to be supplemented with the new ones to improve the forecasting potential and practical and strategic orientation of the GVC approach. To this end, approaches which would make it possible to research interconnection between global processes and trends with regional and national innovation-based development tendencies become of crucial importance. Application of foresight methodology may significantly contribute to researching the GVC phenomenon, being a major logical step towards creating advanced policy tools to mobilise available resources and coordinate stakeholders’ actions to increase Russia’s global competitiveness. The paper presents a number of case studies which describe practical application of various foresight methodology components to analyse Russian participation in various GVCs, by the examples of specific product and service groups (fresh fruit and vegetables, car parts, mobile phones, air transport, electronic payment systems). The authors conclude that both full-scale foresight studies and specific components thereof could be applied for the purposes of GVC analysis, strategic planning, and making political decisions. © 2016, Meshkova and Moiseichev.","Competition; Foresight; Global value-added chains (GVCs); Globalisation; Innovation; Trade",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065147670

The second type is the conceptual approach which analyses the evolution of innovation models themselves as well as the models’ theoretical backgrounds and requirements. The focus in this second approach is the advantages and disadvantages of different innovation models in how far they can describe the reality of innovation processes. The paper focuses on the advantages and disadvantages as well as the potential and limitations of the approaches. It also proposes potential future developments of innovation models as well as the analysis of the driving forces that underlie the evolution of innovation models.

This state of affairs is described by Chinese economic researchers as a ""new normal"". Furthermore, such a definition has also been put forward by the officials as an ideological concept, and in that sense the ""new normal"" means not just the current situation, but also a prospective path of development. New structural trends do appear in China's economy. But, by and large, macrotrends kept worsening in 2014 - 2015. Industrial production grew by a diminishing margin, and its expansion pace was roughly the same as in the period of the global crisis in late 2008 - 2009. Sales at the real estate market plummeted, and the prospects of recovery are still unclear. The CPI has been touching a deflationary threshold, reflecting a relative sluggishness of the aggregate demand. Monetary policy turned toward a relaxation with a sequential cause of interest rates and reserve ratios going down. But the possibilities of a further monetary softening are limited because of a high leverage both at the corporate and parastatal sectors, and of a huge overcapacity at the various branches of manufacturing. Nevertheless, hard landing is unlikely to happen in the nearest future. Growth may sustain due not only to the monetary stimuli, but also to new institutional reforms. China's economy is really rebalancing in favor of services, and that process leads to a fast creation of jobs, which, in its turn, assists a consumer demand's expansion. Such a shift is promoted with the newly carried out tax reforms carried out newly at the service sector. The investment demand has been weakening, not least because of the government's efforts to curb the shadow banking activities and to deleverage at the regional and municipal levels. But, at the same time, a huge amount of new businesses has been established as a result of the minimum capital requirements liberalization. The concept of a ""mixed ownership"" pioneered by the top State leaders actually implies a new phase of privatization. Public-private partnership is being installed at the number of infrastructural industries. A wave of new reforms is also prevailing at the banking and equity markets. The government assists the Chinese companies' entry into foreign markets with additional export promotion policies and the ""Go Out"" investment drive.","""New normality""; China; Economic growth; Financial markets; Inflation; Investment platforms; Real estate; Shadow banking",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032900946

There is no major work of fiction which does not raise the question of the ideal and the truth, of good and beauty. Contemporary aesthetics reflects the state of loss of the ideals and value priorities, while blending progress and regress, humanism and anti-humane, good and evil, love and lust. All this leads to the necessity of reframing the sense of the human existence, its aesthetic and spiritual ideals. The moral responsibility of man for his deeds, actions, and thoughts has been one of the major issues of J. M. Coetzee's creative pursuit. His novels express a powerful protest against the violence, examine human cruelty and insensitivity to the suffering the other. Compassion, being one of the dominant motifs, manifests itself as a crucial value.

On the one hand, officials of many countries have announced intentions to participate in its development. On the other hand, numerous studies aimed at measuring the economic viability of the NSR navigation indicate that the route has limited potential and is suitable only for a relatively small segment of shipping. This study is dedicated to solve this contradiction focusing on two different rationales of the NSR use: 1) current economic feasibility which is defined by the level of transportation costs in comparison to alternative transport routes; 2) long-term prospects of the NSR development determined by long-term trends and strategic interests of various countries. It is revealed that the NSR is commercially viable only for bulk cargo transportation in warmer months from and to ports located not far from the NSR. In the long term the effectiveness of the NSR can increase under conditions of further ice melting, development of Russian Arctic zone, in particular, the infrastructure along the NSR, and increasing political and other risks along the traditional trade routes between Europe and Asia. On the contrary, the slowdown in Asia-European trade and the suspension of some oil Sc gas projects in Russian Arctic worsen to some extent the NSR prospects.","Arctic; International shipping; International trade routes; Northern Sea Route; Russia's arctic zone","cargo handling; cost; international trade; port operation; port trade; shipping; transportation economics; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Russian Federation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960848674

Participants of communication consider opponents not as sovereign personality with a certain political and axiological paradigm, but as an object of political opposition. They deny the possibility of finding common basic positions and dialogue. In order to justify the refusal of constructive communication an ""enemy image"" is created, which is impossible and unworthy to engage in dialogue and try to find a consensus. Thus, social tension increases, degree of social aggression is going up, while the distrust and hatred is heated.

The author also tests whether the effects of the Protestant work ethic extend beyond the religious population of Protestant countries. The multilevel models built on 25,437 respondents in 55 countries show no significant difference in work ethic between Muslims and Protestants. Living in a historically Protestant society does not increase work ethic, but being religious in a Protestant society does. As countries develop, work ethic is likely to decrease.

Korea’s rapid development over the past half-century has led to the diversification of groups from whom the government must seek legitimacy, and it is argued that the committee-based system continues to be adopted due to its ability to incorporate these diverse voices into the policy making process, while at the same time allowing the government to further its developmental agenda.

To consider possible risk factors that might influence formation of coronary artery (CA) aneurisms in children with Kawasaki disease (KD). Patients and methods. We retrospectively analyzed data of medical case records of 168 patients aged 1 month 13 days to 13 years 6 months, who visited the University children's clinical hospital of I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University from 2003 to 2014. All patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1 included 24 (14.2%) infants aged not more than 6 months, group 2 - 31 (18.34%) infants aged 6-12 months. Patients aged 12 months to 5 years comprised group 3 - 94 (55.63%); and 19 (11.83%) children older than 5 years - group 4. Results. In no one of patients younger than 6 months fever lasted less than 1 week; the percentage of children, who had fever for 8-14 days was 51.37%. In other groups, this parameter was significantly less. The chance for development of CA aneurisms? increased with each day of persistence of fever for the youngest children by 1.32 times, and for the oldest - by 1.02 times. Patients of group 1 were characterized (differences are reliable; p &lt; 0.05) by the least levels of haemoglobin, significantly more marked thrombocytosis and maximal leukocytosis. Children of group 1 received modern adequate treatment more rarely; after the 10th day of disease diagnosis was most often made in groups 1 and 4, and in the first of them IVIG were more often administered after the 10th day. Among other factors essential for development of coronary artery aneurisms was the influence of a patient's age and the time of the beginning of immunoglobulin therapy. In fact, the frequency of development of CA aneurisms corresponded to the expected one- in the group of children younger than 6 months, coronary artery aneurisms developed in 62.5% of cases. The older a child, the less the chance for development of CA aneurism, provided that treatment was early and adequate. If immunoglobulin was introduced after the 10th day of disease, the age had practically no influence on the chance for development of aneurism. Conclusion. The age of children with KD does not only influence the development of CA aneurisms but also modifies the effect of other risk factors. We noted their greatest number and the highest frequency of development of CA aneurisms in the group of patients younger than 6 months, which might reflect the specificities of the course of KD in the youngest patients, and necessitates intensive initial therapy of disease.","Age; Children; Coronary artery aneurisms; Kawasaki disease; Regression analysis; Risk factors",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974731022

Students who apply for a programme with the same score are tied. Ties are broken by lottery in Ireland, by objective factors in Turkey (such as date of birth) and by other precisely defined rules in Spain. In Hungary, however, an equal treatment policy is used, students applying for a programme with the same score are all accepted or rejected together. In such a situation there is only one decision to make, whether or not to admit the last group of applicants with the same score who are at the boundary of the quota. Both concepts can be described in terms of stable score-limits. The strict rejection of the last group with whom a quota would be violated corresponds to the concept of H-stable (i.e. higher-stable) score-limits that is currently used in Hungary. We call the other solutions based on the less strict admission policy as L-stable (i.e. lower-stable) score-limits. We show that the natural extensions of the Gale–Shapley algorithms produce stable score-limits, moreover, the applicant-oriented versions result in the lowest score-limits (thus optimal for students) and the college-oriented versions result in the highest score-limits with regard to each concept. When comparing the applicant-optimal H-stable and L-stable score-limits we prove that the former limits are always higher for every college. Furthermore, these two solutions provide upper and lower boundaries for any solution arising from a tie-breaking strategy. Finally we show that both the H-stable and the L-stable applicant-proposing score-limit algorithms are manipulable. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","College admissions; Mechanism design; Stable matching",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957951422

It involves a boundary-oriented pixel labeling so that the cluster growing is performed by expanding its boundary iteratively. The starting point is a cluster consisting of just one seed, the pixel with the coldest temperature. The baseline version of the SEC algorithm uses Otsu's thresholding method to fine-tune the homogeneity threshold. Unfortunately, this method does not always lead to a satisfactory solution. Therefore, we introduce a self-tuning version of the algorithm in which the homogeneity threshold is locally derived from the approximation criterion over a window around the pixel under consideration. The window serves as a boundary regularizer.These two unsupervised versions of the algorithm have been applied to a set of 28 SST images of the western coast of mainland Portugal, and compared against a supervised version fine-tuned by maximizing the F-measure with respect to manually labeled ground-truth maps. The areas built by the unsupervised versions of the SEC algorithm are significantly coincident over the ground-truth regions in the cases at which the upwelling areas consist of a single continuous fragment of the SST map. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Approximate clustering; Homogeneity criterion; Seeded region growing; SST images; Upwelling","Algorithms; Approximation algorithms; Atmospheric temperature; Image segmentation; Iterative methods; Oceanography; Pixels; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Approximate clustering; Homogeneity criterion; Seeded region growing; SST images; Upwelling; Clustering algorithms; algorithm; homogeneity; nearshore dynamics; pixel; sea surface temperature; upwelling; Portugal","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945477715

We estimate the resource movement and spending effects as determined by the theoretical model and find the presence of several signs of Dutch disease: the negative impact of the real effective exchange rate on the growth in the manufacturing sector, the growth of the total income of workers, and the positive link between the real effective exchange rate and returns on capital in all three sectors. However, the shift of labor from manufacturing to services cannot be explained by the appreciation of the ruble alone. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cointegration model; Dutch disease; Economic policy; Real effective exchange rate; Resource curse; Russia","Finance; Manufacture; Co-integration model; Dutch disease; Economic policies; Exchange rates; Resource curse; Russia; Economics; capital; cointegration analysis; economic development; economic growth; economic policy; exchange rate; income; manufacturing; Russian Federation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942329107

Drawing on a unique dataset collected through the administration of a questionnaire to a representative sample of the population of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, we have found that institutional trust is the strongest predictor of prosociality. This result suggests that, in collectivist societies with low levels of generalized trust, the lack of citizens' confidence in the fairness and efficiency of public institutions may compromise social order. The strengthening of institutional trust may also reinforce prosocial behaviour in individualist societies, where a decline in generalized trust has been documented by empirical studies. © 2014 Millennium Economics Ltd.",,,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84918550798

As such, policymakers have constructed a number of different credentials to identify high quality teachers. Unfortunately, few of the credentials used in developing countries have been validated (in terms of whether teachers holding such credentials actually improve student achievement). In this study, we employ a student-fixed effects model to estimate the impact of teacher credentials on student achievement in the context of the biggest education system in the world: China. We find that having a teacher with the highest rank (a credential based on annual assessments by local administrators) has positive impacts on student achievement relative to having a teacher who has not achieved the highest rank. We further find that teacher rank has heterogeneous impacts, benefiting economically poor students more than non-poor students. However, whether a teacher attends college or holds teaching awards does not appear to provide additional information on teacher quality (in terms of improving student achievement). © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","China; Student achievement; Teacher credentials; Teacher quality",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940511309

However, apart from clinical descriptions, to date the pathophysiology of SPD is not fully understood due to the rareness of the syndrome and a lack of experimental studies. In a case study of one patient with schizotypal disorder, we applied a multimodal approach to understanding the SPD phenomena. The patient's clinical profile was identified as disruption of implicit bodily function, accompanied by depressive symptoms. On a neuropsychological level, the patient exhibited impairment in executive functioning, intact tactile perception and kinesthetic praxis. Behavioral tests revealed an altered sense of time but unimpaired self-agency. Furthermore, the patient exhibited a lack of empathy and he had autistic traits, although with a sufficient ability to verbalize his feelings. On the neurobiological level using an active and passive touch paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found a hyperconnectivity of the default-mode network and salience network and a hypoconnectivity of the central executive brain networks in the performance of the touch task as well as intact perceptual touch processing emerging from the direct comparisons of the touch conditions. Our data provide evidence for the important role of altered large-brain network functioning in SPD that corresponds to the specific behavioral and neurocognitive phenomena. © 2015 Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.","Disembodiment; fMRI; Neurocognition; Schizotypal disorder; Self; Somatopsychic depersonalization; Time perception; Touch","adult; brain; case report; complication; depersonalization; human; male; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; psychomotor performance; schizotypal personality disorder; somatoform disorder; Adult; Brain; Depersonalization; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Schizotypal Personality Disorder; Somatoform Disorders","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984804798

The analysis of the specific amalgamation of monism and the ontological and epistemological dualism of the early Pythagoreans and Eleatics shows that European thought inherited from these schools a philosophical foundation of interrelationship between cosmology and ethics together with a tangle of unresolved problems. These problems are visible in the first appearances of philosophical reactions to four key existentialistepistemological phenomena: The twoness, the angst, the dirtiness, and the error. We follow the traces of this heritage, systematised by Plato and Aristotle, through examples from the teachings of Galileo, Kepler, Agrippa, Descartes and Bacon, Kant's schematism and categorical imperative, Vernadsky's noosphere, and Naess' deep ecology and his quest for a""non-Galilean"" ontology.","Cosmology; Dualism.; Eleatics; Error; Ethics; Evil; Monism; Pythagoreans; The One",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029905914

We consider the influence of electric field on the polymer coil as well as on the polymer globule. We show that when the polymer chain conformation is a coil, application of external electric field leads to its additional swelling. However, when the polymer conformation is a globule, a sufficiently strong field can induce a globule-coil transition. We show that such ""field-induced"" globule-coil transition at the sufficiently small monomer polarizabilities goes quite smoothly. On the contrary, when the monomer polarizability exceeds a certain threshold value, the globule-coil transition occurs as a dramatic expansion in the regime of first-order phase transition.

Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) aims to bring together all available epidemiological data using a coherent measurement framework, standardised estimation methods, and transparent data sources to enable comparisons of health loss over time and across causes, age-sex groups, and countries. The GBD can be used to generate summary measures such as disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE) that make possible comparative assessments of broad epidemiological patterns across countries and time. These summary measures can also be used to quantify the component of variation in epidemiology that is related to sociodemographic development. Methods We used the published GBD 2013 data for age-specific mortality, years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) to calculate DALYs and HALE for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2013 for 188 countries. We calculated HALE using the Sullivan method; 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) represent uncertainty in age-specific death rates and YLDs per person for each country, age, sex, and year. We estimated DALYs for 306 causes for each country as the sum of YLLs and YLDs; 95% UIs represent uncertainty in YLL and YLD rates. We quantified patterns of the epidemiological transition with a composite indicator of sociodemographic status, which we constructed from income per person, average years of schooling after age 15 years, and the total fertility rate and mean age of the population. We applied hierarchical regression to DALY rates by cause across countries to decompose variance related to the sociodemographic status variable, country, and time. Findings Worldwide, from 1990 to 2013, life expectancy at birth rose by 6·2 years (95% UI 5·6-6·6), from 65·3 years (65·0-65·6) in 1990 to 71·5 years (71·0-71·9) in 2013, HALE at birth rose by 5·4 years (4·9-5·8), from 56·9 years (54·5-59·1) to 62·3 years (59·7-64·8), total DALYs fell by 3·6% (0·3-7·4), and age-standardised DALY rates per 100 000 people fell by 26·7% (24·6-29·1). For communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, global DALY numbers, crude rates, and age-standardised rates have all declined between 1990 and 2013, whereas for non-communicable diseases, global DALYs have been increasing, DALY rates have remained nearly constant, and age-standardised DALY rates declined during the same period. From 2005 to 2013, the number of DALYs increased for most specific non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms, in addition to dengue, food-borne trematodes, and leishmaniasis; DALYs decreased for nearly all other causes. By 2013, the five leading causes of DALYs were ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, cerebrovascular disease, low back and neck pain, and road injuries. Sociodemographic status explained more than 50% of the variance between countries and over time for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; maternal disorders; neonatal disorders; nutritional deficiencies; other communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases; musculoskeletal disorders; and other non-communicable diseases. However, sociodemographic status explained less than 10% of the variance in DALY rates for cardiovascular diseases; chronic respiratory diseases; cirrhosis; diabetes, urogenital, blood, and endocrine diseases; unintentional injuries; and self-harm and interpersonal violence. Predictably, increased sociodemographic status was associated with a shift in burden from YLLs to YLDs, driven by declines in YLLs and increases in YLDs from musculoskeletal disorders, neurological disorders, and mental and substance use disorders. In most country-specific estimates, the increase in life expectancy was greater than that in HALE. Leading causes of DALYs are highly variable across countries. Interpretation Global health is improving. Population growth and ageing have driven up numbers of DALYs, but crude rates have remained relatively constant, showing that progress in health does not mean fewer demands on health systems. The notion of an epidemiological transition - in which increasing sociodemographic status brings structured change in disease burden - is useful, but there is tremendous variation in burden of disease that is not associated with sociodemographic status. This further underscores the need for country-specific assessments of DALYs and HALE to appropriately inform health policy decisions and attendant actions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; automutilation; brain disease; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; cerebrovascular disease; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; chronic respiratory tract disease; congenital malformation; dengue; depression; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; disability; disability adjusted life year; drowning; educational status; endocrine disease; female; fertility; health status; hematologic disease; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; income; iron deficiency anemia; ischemic heart disease; leishmaniasis; life expectancy; liver cirrhosis; low back pain; major clinical study; malaria; male; malignant neoplastic disease; maternal disease; measles; meningitis; mental disease; mortality; musculoskeletal disease; neck pain; neurologic disease; newborn disease; non communicable disease; nutritional deficiency; nutritional disorder; premature mortality; priority journal; protein calorie malnutrition; respiratory tract infection; substance abuse; tetanus; traffic accident; tuberculosis; urogenital tract disease; violence; chronic disease; Communicable Diseases; health; middle aged; population dynamics; quality adjusted life year; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; Wounds and Injuries; Aged; Chronic Disease; Communicable Diseases; Female; Global Health; Health Transition; Humans; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality, Premature; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Socioeconomic Factors; Wounds and Injuries","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949086655

Rowe. The study aimed to assess the reformist potential of Russian school principals. We believe that this potential is determined in the present context by a leadership style that involves teachers in decision-making processes and the delegation of responsibilities to them in uncertain situations that require them to solve extremely complex tasks. Using the two-factor leadership model proposed by B. Bass, we suggest that either the transformational or transactional leadership style may prove to be effective depending on a given school's individual circumstances. Consequently, two types of leaders may be the most effective in terms of their ability to enact reforms: (1) principals who mainly exhibit a conceptual decision-making style and secondarily make recourse to an analytical style; (2) principals who mainly exhibit an analytical decision-making style and secondarily make resource to a conceptual style. The article establishes that only 12% of school principals apply the conceptual decision-making style while relying on an analytical style to a secondary degree. These are the principals who we classify as transformational leaders. Only 11% are effectively prepared to implement changes given a specific environment. These are the transactional leaders who are likely to change their leadership style for a transformational one. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978039262

Integration of different types of connectivity data (such as co-expression and genetic interactions) in one network has proven to benefit 'guilt by association' analysis. However predictive values of connectives of different types, that had their specific functional meaning and topological characteristics were not obvious, and have been addressed in this analysis. Methods: eQTL data for 3 experimental C.elegans age groups were retrieved from WormQTL. WormNet has been used to obtain pair-wise gene interactions. The Shortest Path Function (SPF) has been adopted for statistical validation of the co-expressed gene clusters and for computational prediction of their potential gene expression regulators from a network context. A new SPF-based algorithm has been applied to genetic interactions sub-networks adjacent to the clusters of co-expressed genes for ranking the most likely gene expression regulators causal to eQTLs. Results: We have demonstrated that known co-expression and genetic interactions between C. Elegans genes can be complementary in predicting gene expression regulators. Several algorithms were compared in respect to their predictive potential in different network connectivity contexts. We found that genes associated with eQTLs are highly clustered in a C. Elegans co-expression sub-network, and their adjacent genetic interactions provide the optimal functional connectivity environment for application of the new SPF-based algorithm. It was successfully tested in the reverse-prediction analysis on groups of genes with known regulators and applied to co-expressed genes and experimentally observed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates differences in topology and connectivity of co-expression and genetic interactions sub-networks in WormNet. The modularity of less continuous genetic interaction network does not correspond to modularity of the dense network comprised by gene co-expression interactions. However the genetic interaction network can be used much more efficiently with the SPF method in prediction of potential regulators of gene expression. The developed method can be used for validation of functional significance of suggested eQTLs and a discovery of new regulatory modules. © 2015 Valba et al.","eQTL; Longevity; Networks; Regulatory genes; The shortest paths","Article; Caenorhabditis elegans; controlled study; gene cluster; gene expression; gene interaction; gene regulatory network; predictive value; priority journal; quantitative trait locus; regulator gene","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959234689

Neuropsychological testing showed that men took significantly more time to perform tasks requiring task switching, searching for stimuli, and arranging them.

The wonderful fact is that for a given n all zeroes are not chaotically scattered around the moduli space, but lie on smooth curves, with just a few cusps, located at zeroes of discriminant x (Fn). We call this phenomenon the Mandelbrot property. If approached by the cabling method, symmetrically-colored HOMFLY polynomials HnK(A|q) can be considered as linear forms on the n-th “power” of the knot K, and one can wonder if zeroes of resultant q2 (Hn, Hm) can also possess the Mandelbrot property. We present and discuss such resultant-zeroes patterns in the complex-A plane. Though A is hardly an adequate parameter to describe the moduli space of knots, the Mandelbrot-like structure is clearly seen — in full accord with the vision of hep-th/0501235, that concrete slicing of the Universal Mandelbrot set is not essential for revealing its structure. © 2015, The Author(s).","Chern-Simons Theories; Stochastic Processes; Topological Strings",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948766093

Averaging of the independent components demonstrating strongest links with finger movements was performed relative to the moment at which the movement started.

The downward extending part included the tortuous positive leader channel (similar to its upward extending counterpart observed when the cloud polarity was negative) that was often accompanied by much less tortuous but often equally bright downward extending plasma formations of unknown nature. Very faint positive streamer zone was also observed. Either the positive leader channel or the unusual plasma formation (UPF) can come in contact with the grounded plane.

Instead of building a purely probabilistic generative model of text we regularize an ill-posed problem of stochastic matrix factorization by maximizing a weighted sum of the log-likelihood and additional criteria. This approach enables us to combine probabilistic assumptions with linguistic and problem-specific requirements in a single multi-objective topic model. In the theoretical part of the work we derive the regularized EM-algorithm and provide a pool of regularizers, which can be applied together in any combination. We show that many models previously developed within Bayesian framework can be inferred easier within ARTM and in some cases generalized.

Such probability measures form an infinite-dimensional simplex, and the description of its extreme points (in other words, ergodic measures (Formula pressented.) was conjectured by Kerov in connection with nonnegative specializations of Hall–Littlewood symmetric functions. Vershik and Kerov also conjectured the following Law of Large Numbers. Consider an infinite random matrix drawn from an ergodic measure coming from the Kerov’s conjectural classification and its (Formula pressented.) submatrix formed by the first rows and columns. The sizes of Jordan blocks of the submatrix can be interpreted as a (random) partition of (Formula pressented.), or, equivalently, as a (random) Young diagram (Formula pressented.) with (Formula pressented.) boxes. Then, as (Formula pressented.), the rows and columns of (Formula pressented.) have almost sure limiting frequencies corresponding to parameters of this ergodic measure.

Design/methodology/approach – The methodology included two stages: first, classifiers of place product uses and technologies were constructed on the basis of the product concept abstraction (Study 1) and then they were used as tools to systematize data about the attributes of city districts and the everyday activities of their residents to further identify product concepts (Study 2). Findings – Product concepts of five Moscow districts were formulated as sets of benefits or district uses (needs satisfied and activities encouraged) offered to residents. The concepts are expressed in terms of typical constructions but reflect the distinctive features and specificities of the districts. Research limitations/implications – Defining places as product concepts pushes the place product analysis, benefit and lifestyle segmentation forward. Additional place product dimensions and investigated places are advised to improve the reliability of the used classifiers as a tool for documentary research. Practical implications – The developed analytical procedure is a much-needed supplement to existing techniques used to shape the product strategies of places. Identifying contradictory uses helps make product decisions that are appropriate in concurrently supporting all these uses, including providing spatial differentiation of the place product. The study results are thus useful for the development of city master plans characterized by long planning horizons and a high degree of conceptualization. Originality/value – The paper proposes a new method for place product analysis that combines the advantages of both standardized and narrative approaches, introducing a convenient way to address the issue of clarity when transforming a variety of place attributes into core place values and eventual place brands. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Place benefit; Place product; Product concept; Product technology; Resident lifestyle; Typology",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949227695

Particular attention is paid to the research analyzing differences in dynamics of labor and job reallocations in developed and transitional economies. The cross-country comparative analysis provide a basis for several important conclusions. Firstly, despite signifi cant cross-country differences the dynamics of job reallocation in economies under transition exceeds on the whole those in developed countries. Secondly, the structure of the economy (manufacturing sector versus services) is one of the main factors determining both job and worker fl ows. Thirdly, there is an opposite relationship between the dynamics of job turnover and the size of enterprise. Small fi rms play a very important role in job creation, while large fi rms dominate in absolute numbers of jobs created. Fourthly, among the factors determining the differences in job and labor force dynamics institutional characteristics occupy an important place. This suggests that country-specifi c policies and institutions are likely to play an important role in determining the level of job and worker reallocation. Stringent employment protection for regular contracts is believed to have a statistically signifi cant negative effect on the workers' reallocation. Unemployment benefi ts' generosity appears to have a positive impact on average gross worker fl ows.

The local population perceives agroholdings as aggressive intruders reconstructing traditional way of rural life by transforming local enterprises and enhancing unemployment and social inequality. Agroholdings are also seen as major obstacles for successful development of private farming in the region.",,"economic growth; farming system; industrial enterprise; rural development; rural economy; rural population; Belgorod; Russian Federation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958239902

Like many other languages of the family, Archi shows a formal connection between logophoric and reflexive pronouns. The latter differs from the former in that it carries an obligatory intensifier particle. This connection questions the suggestion in Culy (1997); cf. also Dimmendaal (2001) to separate African-style 'pure' logophoric systems from systems where a long-distance reflexive is used in the same context. Culy (1997), in a typological analysis of logophoricity, argues that long-distance reflexives in logophoric contexts are a secondary extension of the reflexive function. Toldova (1999), in an overview of East Caucasian systems, suggests on the contrary that, in these languages, logophoricity is the primary function and the reflexive function is its extension. In their approaches, neither Culy nor Toldova rely on notions such as focus of empathy (Kuno, 1987), and Culy even explicitly disproves its relevance for the typology of logophoric systems. The solution suggested in the present study is discourse-based and is not unlike the focus of empathy. Both logophoric and reflexive uses of the Archi pronoun, corresponding to two clearly different and well established comparative concepts, constitute one descriptive category (Haspelmath, 2010). They both are extensions of the core function of the pronoun which is to mark the special pragmatic/discourse role of its referent - extensions that involve grammaticization of the pronoun in specific contexts as reflexives and logophoric. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Archi; East Caucasian languages; Logophoric pronouns; Reported speech",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949533125

The basis of the study is uniquely empirical, obtained through a series of large-scale surveys among Russian producers and consumers of KIBS. The collected data provide quantitative evidence for the spatial dimension of the sector. Comparative analysis of the production and consumption of KIBS in Russia's federal districts makes it possible to classify the latter in terms of the exchange of related services and mapping of the intensity of their interregional supply and demand across federal districts. It is established that companies offering KIBS in Russia are largely concentrated in big cities. The demand for KIBS is more distributed, but not spatially neutral.

FTA practitioners have used frequently one or a suitable mixture of these methods for their activities. Changing policy and strategy making contexts as well as enabling technologies increased the need and possibility for performing adaptive Foresight studies in order to improve decision making about the future and using making better use of limited resources. This study performs a scientometric analysis of the publications in the major FTA journals with the aim of understanding the dynamics of using Foresight methods across time. Among the other branches of FTA, including forecasting, futures, and technology assessment, a special emphasis is given on Foresight as a systematic and inclusive way of exploring long term futures, developing visions and formulating policies for action. The study aims at detecting the key Trends and Weak Signals regarding the use of existing methods and emerging ones with potential uses for Foresight activities. Further implications will be achieved with the generation of networks for quantitative and qualitative methods. This will demonstrate the most frequently combined Foresight methods by researchers and practitioners. Where possible the methods will also be cross-fertilised with the key thematic areas to illustrate the relationships between policy domains and industrial sectors covered by the scope of study with methodological choice. This output is considered to be taken as a methodological guide for any researchers, practitioners or policy makers, who might embark upon or involved in a Foresight activity. Further outputs of the study will include the identification of centres of excellence in the use of Foresight methods and collaboration networks between countries, institutions and policy domains. Overall, the paper demonstrates how scientometric tools can be used to understand the dynamics of evolution in a research field. Thus, it provides an overview of the use of methods in Foresight, and how it is distinguished from the other FTA activities; the evolutionary characteristics of methodological design and factors influencing the choice of methods; and finally a discussion on the future potentials for new cutting-edge approaches. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.","Foresight; Foresight methods; FTA; Scientometrics",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942980466

The samples were studied by a complex of methods (synchrotron radiation X-ray powder diffraction, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, absorption spectroscopy). The sequence of the added reagents effects the phase composition (anatase or mixtures of anatase and “η-TiO2”), size of crystallites, nanoparticles and agglomerates, manganese content, and oxidation state (Mn3+, Mn2+/Mn3+, or Mn3+/Mn4+). The Mn-doped TiO2 samples have been proven to have high photocatalytic activity for methyl orange (MO) under visible light. The rate of MO degradation reached 0.0046 min−1 (50 % in 150 min) for the sample containing a mixture of anatase (75 %) and “η-TiO2” (25 %) with a high degree of amorphism; the sample is characterized by the smallest size of crystallites (44.3 Å), the largest size of nanoparticles (33 nm) and agglomerates (10 μm), and the lowest manganese content (0.3 at. %) with the ratio Mn3+:Mn4+ = 1:1. The resultant Mn-doped titania has potential applications in photocatalysis and environmental protection.

For a sample of 83 nonfinancial firms listed on the Santiago Stock Market from 2005 to 2013, we find a discount for both business and ownership diversification, which is consistent with that reported for other economic or institutional settings. Second, we find that the business diversification discount is related to the ownership structure and is due to the excess of the largest shareholders' control rights. Third, we find that the ownership diversification discount becomes a premium when the ownership diversification enables the control of the affiliated firms. This effect can be explained by the improvement of internal capital markets that allows overcoming the limitations of Chilean external capital markets. © 2014 ACEDE.","Business diversification; Chile; Emerging Latin-American markets; Firm value; Ownership structure",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942097227

Two experiments continually measured spatial characteristics of ocular drift at central fixation during and after auditory number presentation. Consistent with the notion of a spatially oriented mental number line, we found spontaneous magnitude-dependent gaze adjustments, both with and without a concurrent saccadic task. This fixation adjustment (1) had a small-number/left-lateralized bias and (2) it was biphasic as it emerged for a short time around the point of lexical access and it received later robust representation around following number onset. This pattern suggests a two-step mechanism of sensorimotor mapping between numbers and space - a first-pass bottom-up activation followed by a top-down and more robust horizontal SNARC.

This is often viewed as a competitive process wherein a lexical representation is retrieved among semantically-related alternatives. The left prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is thought to help overcome competition for word selection through top-down control. However, whether the LPFC is always necessary for word selection remains unclear. We tested 6 LPFC-injured patients and controls in two picture naming paradigms varying in terms of item repetition. Both paradigms elicited the expected semantic interference effects (SIE), reflecting interference caused by semantically-related representations in word selection. However, LPFC patients as a group showed a larger SIE than controls only in the paradigm involving item repetition. We argue that item repetition increases interference caused by semantically-related alternatives, resulting in increased LPFC-dependent cognitive control demands. The remaining network of brain regions associated with word selection appears to be sufficient when items are not repeated. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..","Chronic stroke patients; Language production; Left prefrontal cortex; Proactive control; Semantic interference; Word selection","adult; Article; brain function; brain region; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; executive function; female; human; left prefrontal cortex; male; mental task; prefrontal cortex; response time; semantics; task performance; word selection; aged; cerebrovascular accident; middle aged; pathology; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; prefrontal cortex; psychology; reaction time; repetition priming; semantics; verbal behavior; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Photic Stimulation; Prefrontal Cortex; Reaction Time; Repetition Priming; Semantics; Stroke; Verbal Behavior","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942303687

Previously, limited research suggested that the absolute number of deaths from stroke in women was greater than in men, but the incidence and mortality rates were greater in men. However, sex differences in various metrics of stroke burden on a global scale have not been a subject of comprehensive and comparable assessment for most regions of the world, nor have sex differences in stroke burden been examined for trends over time. Methods: Stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and healthy years lost due to disability were estimated as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 Study. Data inputs included all available information on stroke incidence, prevalence and death and case fatality rates. Analysis was performed separately by sex and 5-year age categories for 188 countries. Statistical models were employed to produce globally comprehensive results over time. All rates were age-standardized to a global population and 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were computed. Findings: In 2013, global ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS) incidence (per 100,000) in men (IS 132.77 (95% UI 125.34-142.77); HS 64.89 (95% UI 59.82-68.85)) exceeded those of women (IS 98.85 (95% UI 92.11-106.62); HS 45.48 (95% UI 42.43-48.53)).

Although age-standardized rates of stroke mortality have decreased worldwide in the past 2 decades, the absolute numbers of people who have a stroke every year, and live with the consequences of stroke or die from their stroke, are increasing. Regular updates on the current level of stroke burden are important for advancing our knowledge on stroke epidemiology and facilitate organization and planning of evidence-based stroke care. Objectives: This study aims to estimate incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) and their trends for ischemic stroke (IS) and hemorrhagic stroke (HS) for 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. Methodology: Stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, DALYs and YLDs were estimated using all available data on mortality and stroke incidence, prevalence and excess mortality. Statistical models and country-level covariate data were employed, and all rates were age-standardized to a global population. All estimates were produced with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Results: In 2013, there were globally almost 25.7 million stroke survivors (71% with IS), 6.5 million deaths from stroke (51% died from IS), 113 million DALYs due to stroke (58% due to IS) and 10.3 million new strokes (67% IS). Over the 1990-2013 period, there was a significant increase in the absolute number of DALYs due to IS, and of deaths from IS and HS, survivors and incident events for both IS and HS. The preponderance of the burden of stroke continued to reside in developing countries, comprising 75.2% of deaths from stroke and 81.0% of stroke-related DALYs. Globally, the proportional contribution of stroke-related DALYs and deaths due to stroke compared to all diseases increased from 1990 (3.54% (95% UI 3.11-4.00) and 9.66% (95% UI 8.47-10.70), respectively) to 2013 (4.62% (95% UI 4.01-5.30) and 11.75% (95% UI 10.45-13.31), respectively), but there was a diverging trend in developed and developing countries with a significant increase in DALYs and deaths in developing countries, and no measurable change in the proportional contribution of DALYs and deaths from stroke in developed countries. Conclusion: Global stroke burden continues to increase globally. More efficient stroke prevention and management strategies are urgently needed to halt and eventually reverse the stroke pandemic, while universal access to organized stroke services should be a priority. © 2015 S.

Thomas Brutus finds himself at the intersection of real world and fantastic reality, which makes him horrified. But we can describe this situation in terms of political philosophy, like Hannah Arendt's concept of totalitarian society. It is not the reality of horror that deprives Thomas Brutus of the speaking ability and breaks his connection with the rest of society. Instead the society itself chooses not to confront obvious evil but to exclude the hero from its own ranks and to ignore his attempts to tell what is happening.","Exclusion.; Gogol; Horror; Responsibility",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029866421

In accommodating a broad diversity of nonprofit organizations with different religious and social backgrounds, the Netherlands created an elaborate mechanism for government–nonprofit collaboration in which nonprofit organizations fulfill functions in service delivery and policy formation. However, the sector is now fundamentally fragmented and has little shared identity left today. Paradoxically, its past success also makes it less likely that the Dutch nonprofit sector will be regarded as a solution to current social problems. © 2015, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Civil society; Corporatism; Human services; Partnership; Third sector","civil society; corporate strategy; government relations; nonprofit organization; partnership approach; public sector; Netherlands","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946494221

These are adaptive process frameworks adjustable to software product size and scope. They usually include a set of methods, principles and techniques, and software development tools. Each of the methodologies can implement any of the lifecycle models. We discuss the difference between formal and agile methodologies. The formal methodologies include more artifacts; they have a rich set of complex processes, which include larger workflows and smaller activities. For each activity, every role assigned to it produces a deliverable. In crisis conditions, such as hardly formalizable problems, rapidly changing requirements and other uncertainties, agile methodologies, which are more adaptive and flexible in terms of artifacts, are applicable. The agile methodologies rely on self-disciplined and self-manageable teams, and consequently they are more constrained in terms of human-related factors. Similar to lifecycle models, there is no “silver bullet” in software development methodologies.

In particular, we show that the secular growth of the loop corrections to the two-point correlation functions is gauge independent: we observe the same growth in the case of the static gauge for the constant background electric field. Furthermore we solve the kinetic equation describing photon production from the background fields, which was derived in our previous paper and allows one to sum up leading secularly growing corrections from all loops. Finally, we show that in the constant electric field background the one-loop correction to the current of the produced pairs is not zero: it also grows with time and violates time translational and reversal invariance of QED on the constant electric field background. © 2015, The Author(s).","Anomalies in Field and String Theories; Nonperturbative Effects; Renormalization Group",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942101844

In the current literature the image of “Russian sociology” remains fragmentary and incomplete. Different stages in the history of Russian sociology are usually considered as mutually antagonistic. We challenge this view by arguing that the Russian sociological tradition can be seen as a continuing trajectory of social thought development, lasting from the XIXth century until present days and unified by a set of underlying historically determined common features: publicism (an orientation to non-academic audiences and a desire to promote changes in the real world); moral and ethical concern (a clear expression of value orientations; the particular importance of ethical and moral issues); problem orientation (a focus on urgent social concerns with “problem” dominating over “method” in sociological research). We demonstrate the importance of these features for a better understanding of the perspectives and contributions of Russian sociologists to current international debates. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Methodology; Public sociology; Russian history; Russian sociology",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939262581

To do so, the discussion proceeds in three steps. First, the article documents the considerable scale of the Russian NPO scene as it is visible through the lens of available empirical research. Next, it outlines the key policy measures affecting nonprofit organizations (NPOs) put in place by the Russian government beginning in the latter part of the first decade of the 21st century. Unlike some accounts, however, this one brings into focus both the interesting “tool box” of support programs for NPOs enacted during this period as well as the more restrictive regulatory measures, such as the “foreign agents law,” that also came into force.

For a number of membrane receptors, a modulation of TM domains' oligomerization has been shown to contribute to the development of severe pathological states, thus calling for detailed studies of the atomistic aspects of the process. Despite considerable progress achieved so far, several crucial questions still remain: How do the helices recognize each other in the membrane? What is the driving force of their association? Here, we assess the dimerization free energy of TM helices along with a careful consideration of the interplay between the structure and dynamics of protein and lipids using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in the hydrated lipid bilayer for three different model systems - TM fragments of glycophorin A, polyalanine and polyleucine peptides. We observe that the membrane driven association of TM helices exhibits a prominent entropic character, which depends on the peptide sequence. Thus, a single TM peptide of a given composition induces strong and characteristic perturbations in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer, which may facilitate the initial ""communication"" between TM helices even at the distances of 20-30 Å. Upon tight helix-helix association, the immobilized lipids accommodate near the peripheral surfaces of the dimer, thus disturbing the packing of the surrounding. The dimerization free energy of the modeled peptides corresponds to the strength of their interactions with lipids inside the membrane being the lowest for glycophorin A and similarly higher for both homopolymers. We propose that the ability to accommodate lipid tails determines the dimerization strength of TM peptides and that the lipid matrix directly governs their association. © 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"glycophorin; lipid; lipid bilayer; peptide; polyalanine; polyleucine; protein binding; chemistry; lipid bilayer; molecular dynamics; thermodynamics; Glycophorin; Lipid Bilayers; Lipids; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Peptides; Protein Binding; Thermodynamics","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941088938

Currently developed innovative decision support systems (DSS) aim to achieve optimum results while minimizing the risks of serious losses. The purpose of the DSS is to help the decision-maker facing the problem of huge amounts of data and ambiguous reactions of complicated systems depending on external factors. By means of accurate and profound analysis, DSSs are expected to provide the user with precisely forecasted indicators and optimal decisions. In this paper we suggest a new DSS structure which could be used in a wide range of difficult to formalize tasks and achieve a high speed of calculation and decision-making. We examine different approaches to determining the dependence of a target variable on input data and review the most common statistical forecasting methods. The advantages of using neural networks for this purpose are described. We suggest applying interval neural networks for calculations with underdetermined (interval) data, which makes it possible to use our DSS in a wide range of complicated tasks. We developed a corresponding learning algorithm for the interval neural networks. The advantages of using a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the most significant inputs are shown. We justify the use of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) to achieve high-speed calculations with the decision support system in question.

On the one hand, it is a never-ceasing upgrading of the SC electronics to lower energy consumption and increase its functionality, which in turn makes it more susceptible to electrostatic discharges (ESDs). On the other hand, designers constantly seek to improve electronics protection against ESDs. Spectr-R SC features on-board equipment, which is highly sensitive to possible ESDs. To exclude ESD-related failures, the following protection measures have been taken. Based on the Satellite-MIEM computer code, we developed the lumped-element model of the Spectr-R body currents and cable-affected electronic response. This model made it possible to compute SC body currents initiated by ESDs originating at various structural sites. For various cable harnesses, we measured transformation coefficients converting body currents into the amplitude of the noise voltages appearing in a cable (a patented methodology was used for this purpose). Afterward, these transformation coefficients together with the ESD-induced currents have been fed into the Satellite-MIEM software to compute noise voltages appearing in electronic input circuits, connected via these cables to the satellite exterior surface. Comparing protection efficiency of cables and electronic equipment allowed us to select suitable cable harnesses and the appropriate equipment protection to insure reliable in-flight performance of the space vehicle. From the launch in July 2011 and up to the present time, there were no failures of the Spectr-R electronics, which could be traced to ESDs. © 2015 IEEE.","Electrostatic discharges (ESDs); lumped-element model (LEM); protection; spacecraft (SC) Spektr-R","Automobile bodies; Automobile electronic equipment; Cables; Electronic equipment; Electrostatic devices; Electrostatic discharge; Energy utilization; Equipment; Oscillators (electronic); Satellites; Equipment protection; Exterior surfaces; In-flight performance; Lumped element model; On board equipments; Protection efficiency; Protection measures; Transformation coefficients; Spacecraft","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957844396

We found a robust index of neurolexical memory-trace formation: a rapid enhancement of the brain's activation elicited by novel words during a short (~ 30 min) perceptual exposure, underpinned by fronto-temporal cortical networks, and, importantly, correlated with behavioural learning outcomes. Crucially, this neural memory trace build-up took place regardless of focused attention on the input or any pre-existing or learnt semantics.

However, there is much uncertainty about the processes that connect diversity variables with personal outcomes. In this paper, we are particularly interested in different levels of coalitional affiliation, which refers to people's social allegiances that guide their expectations of social support, in-group strength and cohesion. We operationalize coalitional affiliation as the extent to which people rely on a homogeneous social network, and we measure it with indicators of friendships across ethnic boundaries and frequency of contact with friends. Using multi-level models and data from the European Social Survey (Round 1, 2002-2003) for 19 countries, we demonstrate that coalitional affiliation provides an empirically reliable, as well as theoretically coherent, explanation for various effects of ethnic/racial diversity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Coalitional psychology; Ethnic diversity; Health; Well-being","ancestry group; cultural diversity; demography; ethnic group; Europe; female; friend; health; human; human relation; male; minority group; questionnaire; social network; social support; trust; Continental Population Groups; Cultural Diversity; Ethnic Groups; Europe; Female; Friends; Health; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Minority Groups; Residence Characteristics; Social Networking; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; Trust","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931273539

Due to the convenience of image processing software (e.g., FreeSurfer), standard practice is to rely on automated results without performing visual inspection of intermediate processing. In this work, structural MRIs of 40 healthy controls who were scanned twice were used to determine the test-retest reliability of FreeSurfer-derived cortical measures in four groups of subjects-those 25 that passed visual inspection (approved), those 15 that failed visual inspection (disapproved), a combined group, and a subset of 10 subjects (Travel) whose test and retest scans occurred at different sites. Test-retest correlation (TRC), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and percent difference (PD) were used to measure the reliability in the Destrieux and Desikan-Killiany (DK) atlases. In the approved subjects, reliability of cortical thickness/surface area/volume (DK atlas only) were: TRC (0.82/0.88/0.88), ICC (0.81/0.87/0.88), PD (0.86/1.19/1.39), which represent a significant improvement over these measures when disapproved subjects are included. Travel subjects' results show that cortical thickness reliability is more sensitive to site differences than the cortical surface area and volume. To determine the effect of visual inspection on sample size required for studies of MRI-derived cortical thickness, the number of subjects required to show group differences was calculated. Significant differences observed across imaging sites, between visually approved/disapproved subjects, and across regions with different sizes suggest that these measures should be used with caution. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Cerebral cortical surface area; Cerebral cortical thickness; Cerebral cortical volume; FreeSurfer; Multisite MRI; Test-retest reliability","adult; aged; Article; brain cortex; brain size; computer program; cortical thickness (brain); human; human experiment; imaging software; measurement; neuroimaging; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; test retest reliability; adolescent; anatomy and histology; automated pattern recognition; evaluation study; image processing; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; procedures; reproducibility; software; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cerebral Cortex; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939473755

about levels and trends in disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) is an essential input into global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013), we estimated these quantities for acute and chronic diseases and injuries for 188 countries between 1990 and 2013. Methods Estimates were calculated for disease and injury incidence, prevalence, and YLDs using GBD 2010 methods with some important refinements. Results for incidence of acute disorders and prevalence of chronic disorders are new additions to the analysis. Key improvements include expansion to the cause and sequelae list, updated systematic reviews, use of detailed injury codes, improvements to the Bayesian meta-regression method (DisMod-MR), and use of severity splits for various causes. An index of data representativeness, showing data availability, was calculated for each cause and impairment during three periods globally and at the country level for 2013. In total, 35 620 distinct sources of data were used and documented to calculated estimates for 301 diseases and injuries and 2337 sequelae. The comorbidity simulation provides estimates for the number of sequelae, concurrently, by individuals by country, year, age, and sex. Disability weights were updated with the addition of new population-based survey data from four countries. Findings Disease and injury were highly prevalent; only a small fraction of individuals had no sequelae. Comorbidity rose substantially with age and in absolute terms from 1990 to 2013. Incidence of acute sequelae were predominantly infectious diseases and short-term injuries, with over 2 billion cases of upper respiratory infections and diarrhoeal disease episodes in 2013, with the notable exception of tooth pain due to permanent caries with more than 200 million incident cases in 2013. Conversely, leading chronic sequelae were largely attributable to non-communicable diseases, with prevalence estimates for asymptomatic permanent caries and tension-type headache of 2·4 billion and 1·6 billion, respectively. The distribution of the number of sequelae in populations varied widely across regions, with an expected relation between age and disease prevalence. YLDs for both sexes increased from 537·6 million in 1990 to 764·8 million in 2013 due to population growth and ageing, whereas the age-standardised rate decreased little from 114·87 per 1000 people to 110·31 per 1000 people between 1990 and 2013. Leading causes of YLDs included low back pain and major depressive disorder among the top ten causes of YLDs in every country. YLD rates per person, by major cause groups, indicated the main drivers of increases were due to musculoskeletal, mental, and substance use disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases; however HIV/AIDS was a notable driver of increasing YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the proportion of disability-adjusted life years due to YLDs increased globally from 21·1% in 1990 to 31·2% in 2013. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is leading to a substantial increase in the numbers of individuals with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Rates of YLDs are declining much more slowly than mortality rates. The non-fatal dimensions of disease and injury will require more and more attention from health systems. The transition to non-fatal outcomes as the dominant source of burden of disease is occurring rapidly outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Our results can guide future health initiatives through examination of epidemiological trends and a better understanding of variation across countries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"acute disease; acute hepatitis A; acute hepatitis B; acute otitis media; Africa south of the Sahara; anemia; Article; bacterial skin disease; biliary tract disease; burn; cataract; Chagas disease; chickenpox; chlamydiasis; chronic disease; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; chronic respiratory tract disease; communicable disease; comorbidity; congenital disorder; dengue; dental caries; developed country; developing country; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; digestive system disease; disability; genital herpes; glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; gonorrhea; heart disease; hemolytic anemia; hepatitis C; hepatitis E; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypertension; incidence; injury; intellectual impairment; interstitial nephritis; iron deficiency anemia; ischemic heart disease; low back pain; lower respiratory tract infection; major depression; malaria; malignant neoplastic disease; maternal hypertension; mortality; musculoskeletal disease; neurologic disease; newborn disease; non communicable disease; osteoarthritis; otitis media; ovary polycystic disease; pelvic organ prolapse; periodontal disease; population growth; premenstrual syndrome; prevalence; priority journal; puerperal infection; refraction error; rheumatoid arthritis; schistosomiasis; sickle cell trait; simulation; substance abuse; systematic review (topic); tension headache; thalassemia; tooth pain; traffic accident; trichomoniasis; tropical disease; typhoid fever; upper respiratory tract infection; urinary tract infection; uterus myoma; visual impairment; acute disease; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; child; chronic disease; cost of illness; demography; disabled person; female; health; infant; male; middle aged; Neglected Diseases; newborn; preschool child; sex ratio; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Wounds and Injuries; young adult; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Chronic Disease; Cost of Illness; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Disabled Persons; Female; Global Health; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Neglected Diseases; Prevalence; Residence Characteristics; Sex Distribution; Wounds and Injuries; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940447040

Many of them are linear, i.e., lack disulfide bonds. When isolated from the venom, or obtained by other means, these peptides exhibit common properties. They are cationic; being mostly disordered in aqueous solution, assume amphiphilic α-helical structure in contact with lipid membranes; and exhibit general cytotoxicity, including antifungal, antimicrobial, hemolytic, and anticancer activities. To suit the pharmacological needs, the activity spectrum of these peptides should be modified by rational engineering. As an example, we provide a detailed review on latarcins (Ltc), linear cytolytic peptides from Lachesana tarabaevi spider venom. Diverse experimental and computational techniques were used to investigate the spatial structure of Ltc in membrane-mimicking environments and their effects on model lipid bilayers. The antibacterial activity of Ltc was studied against a panel of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, the action of Ltc on erythrocytes and cancer cells was investigated in detail with confocal laser scanning microscopy. In the present review, we give a critical account of the progress in the research of Ltc. We explore the relationship between Ltc structure and their biological activity and derive molecular characteristics, which can be used for optimization of other linear peptides. Current applications of Ltc and prospective use of similar membrane-active peptides are outlined. © 2015 Springer Basel.","Antimicrobial peptide; Biologically active compounds; Correlation analysis; Cytolytic toxin; Mechanism of action; Structure-function relationship","antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; hemolytic agent; latarcin; spider venom; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; antimicrobial cationic peptide; antineoplastic agent; hemolytic agent; latarcin 2a, Lachesana tarabaevi; peptide; spider venom; antibacterial activity; antineoplastic activity; confocal laser microscopy; drug determination; drug effect; drug mechanism; drug response; drug structure; drug synthesis; growth inhibition; hemolysis; human; Lachesana tarabaevi; membrane structure; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; Review; spider; amino acid sequence; animal; cell membrane; chemistry; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbial sensitivity test; molecular genetics; protein secondary structure; structure activity relation; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Membrane; Hemolytic Agents; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptides; Protein Structure, Secondary; Spider Venoms; Structure-Activity Relationship","English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946482087

Because of the high investment costs of additional vehicles, organizations allow the vehicles to perform multiple trips as in multi-trip vehicle routing problems (MTVRP), which reflects the real requirements better than the classical VRP. This study contributes to the literature by using a mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation and a simulated annealing (SA) based solution methodology for CumMTVRP-LD, which considers the minimization of fuel consumption as the objective function.

The article focuses on Russia-ASEAN trade. The author applies innovative methods of measuring trade in value added terms in order to capture the unobserved bilateral linkages behind the offi cially recorded trade fl ows. First, customs and balance of payments sources of bilateral trade data are briefl y reviewed. For user, there are at least two inherent problems in those data: the inconsistencies in ""mirror trade fl ows and the attribution of the origin of a traded product wholly to the exporting country. This results in large discrepancies between Russian and ASEAN ""mirror trade data and, arguably, their low importance as each other's trade partners. Next, the author explores new data from inter-country input-output tables that necessarily reconcile bilateral differences and offer greater detail about the national and sectoral origin or destination of traded goods and services. Relevant data are derived from the OECD-WTO TiVA database and are rearranged to obtain various estimates of Russia-ASEAN trade in value added in 2009. The main fi nding is that sizable amount of the value added of Russian origin is embodied in third countries' exports to ASEAN members and ASEAN members' exports to third countries. As a result, the cumulative fl ow of Russia's value added to ASEAN members is estimated to be 62% larger than the direct gross exports, whereas for China and South Korea it is, respectively, 21% and 23% smaller. The indirect, unobserved value added fl ows can be largely explained by the use of Russian energy resources, chemicals and metals as imported inputs in third countries (China, South Korea) and ASEAN members' own production. The contribution of these inputs is then accumulated along the value chain. Finally, the most important sectoral value chains are visualized for readers' convenience. So far, it's apparent that Russia is linked to ASEAN countries through intricate production networks and indirectly contributes to their trade with third countries.","ASEAN; Global value chains; Input-output tables; International trade; Russia; Statistics; Trade; Value added",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033713856

Building on the Fiscal Theory of Price Level (FTPL) and the Fiscal Theory of Sovereign Risk (FTSR), this paper differs in its baseline assumption about the monetary policy objective, which is neither to rule out defaults regardless of inflation costs (as in FTPL), nor to follow inflation targeting regardless of associated sovereign risk (as in FTSR). Instead, we study the case in which the central bank controls the risky interest rate to minimize the probability of default while ruling out large inflation hikes. We show that this policy regime can mitigate default risks only when the central bank is expected to allow sufficient increases in inflation. When agents believe that the central bank's tolerance toward inflation hikes has increased, equilibrium risk premium goes down, suggesting that information concerning changes in the central bank's preferences over inflation directly impacts default risks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Default; FTPL; Inflation; Monetary policy; Sovereign debt",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930082514

FindingsIn addition to a discount for unrelated business diversification, the authors find an ownership diversification discount when non-financial firms are shareholders of other firms. However, this discount turns into a premium when the firm gains the control of the owned firm, especially in related sectors.

DA neurons display a range of activity modes that vary in frequency and degree of burst firing. Importantly, DA neuronal bursting is associated with a significantly greater degree of DA release than an equivalent tonic activity pattern. Here, we introduce a single compartmental, conductance-based computational model for DA cell activity that captures the behavior of DA neuronal dynamics and examine the multiple factors that underlie DA firing modes: the strength of the SK conductance, the amount of drive, and GABA inhibition. Our results suggest that neurons with low SK conductance fire in a fast firing mode, are correlated with burst firing, and require higher levels of applied current before undergoing depolarization block. We go on to consider the role of GABAergic inhibition on an ensemble of dynamical classes of DA neurons and find that strong GABA inhibition suppresses burst firing. Our studies suggest differences in the distribution of the SK conductance and GABA inhibition levels may indicate subclasses of DA neurons within the VTA. We further identify, that by considering alternate potassium dynamics, the dynamics display burst patterns that terminate via depolarization block, akin to those observed in vivo in VTA DA neurons and in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) DA cell preparations under apamin application. In addition, we consider the generation of transient burst firing events that are NMDA-initiated or elicited by a sudden decrease of GABA inhibition, that is, disinhibition. © 2015 Oster, Faure and Gutkin.","Bursting; Dopamine; GABA; Modeling; NMDA; Regular firing; SK channel; VTA","Amines; Depolarization; Dynamics; Models; Neural networks; Neurophysiology; Bursting; Dopamine; GABA; NMDA; Regular firing; SK channel; VTA; Neurons; 4 aminobutyric acid receptor; AMPA receptor; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; Article; cell activity; cell function; compartment model; controlled study; dopamine release; dopaminergic nerve cell; dopaminergic transmission; glutamatergic synapse; mathematical computing; mesencephalon; midbrain ventral segmental area; molecular dynamics; nerve cell membrane conductance; nerve cell membrane steady potential; nerve cell stimulation; spike; substantia nigra pars compacta","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940180508

The corresponding transaction costs can be rewritten as a nonlinear function G of the volume of traded assets, with G′(0)>0. For a stock with Black–Scholes midprice dynamics, we exhibit an asymptotically convergent replicating portfolio, defined on a regular time grid with n trading dates. Up to a well-chosen regularization hn of the payoff function, we first introduce the frictionless replicating portfolio of $h^{n}(S^{n}_{1})$, where Sn is a fictitious stock with enlarged local volatility dynamics. In the market with frictions, a suitable modification of this portfolio strategy provides a terminal wealth that converges in $\mathbb{L}^{2}$ to the claim h(S<inf>1</inf>) as n goes to infinity. In terms of order book shapes, the exhibited replicating strategy only depends on the size 2G′(0) of the bid–ask spread.

Despite the fact that Russia's contemporary corruption has recently become a subject of analysis, there is, however, no study that has addressed the role of the Communist legacy in the development of various aspects of corruption. This paper contributes to the debates through, first, disentangling the complex phenomenon that is corruption, and focusing on its three aspects: supply, demand, and the attitude of the population. Second, the paper also contributes to the literature on modern corruption by explicitly focusing on the role of the historical legacy in these different aspects of corruption. The study is based on several rich data-sets on corruption and on an original data-set compiled to measure the percentage share of Communists in various regions of Russia in the last decades of the USSR (1970s-1980s). The analysis presented in the paper uncovers different roles of the Communist legacies across the development of various aspects of corruption. By doing so, the paper contributes to the literature on historical legacies in general, on Communist legacies in particular, as well as to the broader literature on the causes of corruption in transitional societies. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Communism; Corruption; Historical legacies; Mechanisms of transmission; Regions; Russia",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929654196

The recent experience of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives (ASI) in Russia provides a valuable example of establishing a new government agency to advance economic deregulation in an environment where the political appetite for reform is limited. In our view, ASI has been the most successful institutional innovation to emerge in Russia since the 2008–09 financial crisis. Rather than engage in the traditional tussle over budget funds and benefits, ASI's mandate has been to organise a strategic dialogue with the private sector and build consensus within the government. We consider ASI's institutional set-up in light of the good practice principles adopted under Russia's ‘new industrial policy’. Our findings suggest other middle-income economies may find ASI's experience applicable when designing institutions to support a deregulation reform agenda. While the crisis in Ukraine has triggered a fundamental shift in Russia's development path that is likely to make ASI's deregulation efforts largely irrelevant, the agency's practical experience remains pertinent to the broader discussion of institutional arrangements to promote deregulation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,"deregulation; economic reform; institutional framework; post-communism; reform process; regulatory framework; strategic approach; Russian Federation","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939452376

The differences between the zero copulas and lexical verbs turn out to be of two types: a copula allows some uses, prohibited for lexical verbs, and, in contrast, is impossible in other constructions where lexical verbs can participate. The differences are due to two properties of copulas: (1) lack of morphologically-marked categories and (2) lack of a lexical stem.

We test the hypothesis that teachers' perceptions of their relationship with their classes are good predictors of such inaccuracies. This is important because teachers often focus on their relationship with the class as an end in itself or as a means to engaging students. Good teacher-student relations may indeed result in more students' learning, but perhaps not nearly as much as teachers' believe. We find that both Russian and mathematics teachers make inaccurate predictions of their class' high stakes examination results based on how they perceive their relationship with their class.

All this implies non-trivial relations for the coefficients of the differential expansions, which are believed to provide reasonable coordinates in the space of knots - existence of such universal relations means that these variables are still not unconstrained. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934925275

This legitimizing power is highly relevant in social conflicts of modern societies that are governed by market-oriented value systems. However, prejudice research has yet to be linked to sociological discourses on the marketization of society. We argue that Institutional Anomie Theory (IAT), a theory originally developed to explain crime rates, offers a fruitful macro-sociological framework for a better understanding of micro-social prejudices that emerge along with processes of marketization. Extending IAT to explain prejudices in a German study based on survey data offers a first attempt to underpin our theoretical hypotheses with empirical data. Although the results need to be interpreted with due caution, they suggest that the extended IAT model can be usefully applied to explain how a marketized mentality is related to different forms of institutional integration, and how it is conducive to specific prejudices that emerge in market-dominated societies against purported economically burdening social groups. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Institutional anomie; Marketization; Prejudice; Social institutions","adolescent; adult; aged; anomie; attitude; crime; female; Germany; homeless person; human; male; middle aged; migrant; prejudice; questionnaire; social discrimination; social psychology; socioeconomics; thinking; unemployment; very elderly; vulnerable population; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anomie; Attitude; Crime; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Germany; Homeless Persons; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prejudice; Social Discrimination; Social Values; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thinking; Unemployment; Vulnerable Populations; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925662285

Current estimates of cancer burden in individual countries and regions are necessary to inform local cancer control strategies. OBJECTIVE: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 28 cancers in 188 countries by sex from 1990 to 2013. EVIDENCE REVIEW: The general methodology of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study was used. Cancer registries were the source for cancer incidence data as well as mortality incidence (MI) ratios. Sources for cause of death data include vital registration system data, verbal autopsy studies, and other sources. The MI ratios were used to transform incidence data to mortality estimates and cause of death estimates to incidence estimates. Cancer prevalence was estimated using MI ratios as surrogates for survival data; YLDs were calculated by multiplying prevalence estimates with disability weights, which were derived from population-based surveys; YLLs were computed by multiplying the number of estimated cancer deaths at each age with a reference life expectancy; and DALYs were calculated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. FINDINGS: In 2013 there were 14.9 million incident cancer cases, 8.2 million deaths, and 196.3 million DALYs. Prostate cancer was the leading cause for cancer incidence (1.4 million) for men and breast cancer for women (1.8 million). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer was the leading cause for cancer death in men and women, with 1.6 million deaths. For men, TBL cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (24.9 million). For women, breast cancer was the leading cause of DALYs (13.1 million). Age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) per 100 000 and age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) per 100 000 for both sexes in 2013 were higher in developing vs developed countries for stomach cancer (ASIR, 17 vs 14; ASDR, 15 vs 11), liver cancer (ASIR, 15 vs 7; ASDR, 16 vs 7), esophageal cancer (ASIR, 9 vs 4; ASDR, 9 vs 4), cervical cancer (ASIR, 8 vs 5; ASDR, 4 vs 2), lip and oral cavity cancer (ASIR, 7 vs 6; ASDR, 2 vs 2), and nasopharyngeal cancer (ASIR, 1.5 vs 0.4; ASDR, 1.2 vs 0.3). Between 1990 and 2013, ASIRs for all cancers combined (except nonmelanoma skin cancer and Kaposi sarcoma) increased by more than 10% in 113 countries and decreased by more than 10% in 12 of 188 countries. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cancer poses a major threat to public health worldwide, and incidence rates have increased in most countries since 1990. The trend is a particular threat to developing nations with health systems that are ill-equipped to deal with complex and expensive cancer treatments. The annual update on the Global Burden of Cancer will provide all stakeholders with timely estimates to guide policy efforts in cancer prevention, screening, treatment, and palliation.

This study analyzed Der Spiegel’s articles presenting the crisis and austerity in Europe, focusing on the Greek case, from 2009 until 2014. A thematic analysis was developed in the study a broad corpus of articles, focusing on the main ideas they unfold. Deploying critical political economy literature, critical cultural theory and critical media studies literature, the article criticizes the neoliberal hegemony of the EU’s crisis politics and foregrounds the role of mainstream media, including progressivist or objectivist ones such as Spiegel, in the reproduction of neoliberal ideas that expand far beyond the crisis, to produce the institutions, social relations, beliefs and subjectivities for a post-crisis configuration of capitalism. The article concludes that Spiegel, like other mainstream media, produce a biopolitical policing of the crisis’ exceptionalized subjects (the citizens of indebted countries) and the implementation of crisis-politics by creating a public “structure of feeling” related to the hegemonic crisis’ rationales. These rationales are further connected to the development of the new neoliberal subjectivity, which is an objective of the crisis-reforms, such as austerity regimes. In effect, main- stream media discourses reproduce the hegemonic frames of the crisis and austerity, while negating the possibility of new narratives to emerge in the crisis context. © 2015 Unified Theory of Information Research Group.

The problem is treated as rigorously as possible using boundary conditions appropriate to conventional time of flight experiments. Two types of pulsed carrier generation are considered. In addition to the traditional case of surface excitation, we also consider the case where carrier generation is spatially uniform. In our analysis, the front electrode is treated as a reflecting boundary, while the counter electrode is assumed to act either as a neutral contact (not disturbing the current flow) or as an absorbing boundary at which the carrier concentration vanishes. As expected, at low fields transient currents exhibit unusual behavior, as diffusion currents overwhelm drift currents to such an extent that it becomes impossible to determine transit times (and hence, carrier mobilities). At high fields, computed transients are more like those typically observed, with well-defined plateaus and sharp transit times. Careful analysis, however, reveals that the non-dispersive picture, and predictions of the CDE contradict both experiment and existing disorder-based theories in important ways, and that the CDE should be applied rather cautiously, and even then only for engineering purposes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One of the channels for this process is the dynamical Lamb effect, induced by a nonadiabatic modulation of the atomic-level Lamb shift. However, in experiments with natural atoms it is quite difficult to isolate this effect from other mechanisms of atom excitation. We point out that a transmission line cavity coupled with a superconducting qubit (an artificial macroscopic atom) provides a unique platform for observation of the dynamical Lamb effect. A key idea is to exploit a dynamically tunable qubit-resonator coupling, which was implemented quite recently. By varying the coupling nonadiabatically, it is possible to parametrically excite a qubit through a nonadiabatic modulation of the Lamb shift, even if the cavity was initially empty. The dynamics of such a coupled system is studied within the Rabi model with a time-dependent coupling constant and beyond the rotating-wave approximation.

Among the objects of FXm, in addition to the Tate motives Z/m(j), there are the cohomological relative motives with compact support Mccm (Y/X) of varieties Y quasi-finite over X. Exact functors of inverse image with respect to morphisms of algebraic varieties and direct image with compact supports with respect to quasifinite morphisms of varieties Y → X act on the exact categories FXm. Assuming the existence of triangulated categories of motivic sheaves DM(X, Z/m) over algebraic varieties X over K and a weak version of the 'six operations' in these categories, we identify Fm X with the exact subcategory in DM(X, Z/m) consisting of all the iterated extensions of the Tate twists Mccm (Y/X)(j) of the motives Mccm (Y/X). An isomorphism of the Z/m-modules Ext between the Tate motives Z/m(j) in the exact category FXm with the motivic cohomology modules predicted by the Beilinson- Lichtenbaum étale descent conjecture (recently proved by Voevodsky, Rost et al.) holds for smooth varieties X over K if and only if the similar isomorphism holds for Artin-Tate motives over fields containing K. When K contains a primitive m-root of unity, the latter condition is equivalent to a certain Koszulity hypothesis, as shown in our previous paper [Positselski, 'Mixed Artin-Tate motives with finite coefficients', Mosc.

The present article investigates how various study and work combinations affect the academic performance of students in their final years in Tatarstan higher education institutions. The article examines the first set of results produced by longitudinal studies commenced in 2009 by the Institute of Education, NRU HSE (National Research University, Higher School of Economics). Two factors - work schedule and correspondence between the type of work and the future profession - are used to identify five types of study and work combinations. Various combinations reveal different levels of academic performance, different plans for the future, and somewhat different reasons for having entered an institution of higher education. Regression analysis of the data showed that only one type of study and work combination - non-professional fulltime employment - has a negative effect on academic performance. Other strategies of student employment showed no statistically significant effect on academic performance. All other conditions being equal, professionally employed students perform better than their non-professionally employed counterparts, and sometimes even better than those who do not work at all. The article concludes that the optimal strategy for students is to combine study with professional part-time employment.

Researchers usually establish these correlations using a multiple regression analysis. The results of the analysis, established empirical correlations, may be used to contextualize formal progress (i.e., to adjust expectations for institutions working in more or less favorable conditions).

Considered as a part of global trends, Khrushchev’s initiatives appear rational rather than “harebrained,” as critics have judged them. Contributing to scholarly inquiry into the postwar Soviet system, I also speak to our understanding of global agriculture, suggesting that the scholarship needs to consider the Soviet Union as part of developments shaping the postwar era. © 2016 by University of Hawai‘i Press.",,"agricultural technology; crop yield; economic history; farming system; machinery; management practice; United States; USSR","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973176408

Regions and cities of these countries were the focus of the research (territorial units level NUTS-3). The analysis addresses the question to what degree the remoteness from the regional centre, i.e. the position in the core-periphery system, influences the dynamics of the population size of the territorial units of the given level. For the analytical purposes the distinction has been made between the regional centres including adjacent suburban areas and internal regional periphery comprising districts and cities. The main indicator employed was the distance between the periphery areas and regional centres. The results of the analysis show that in spite of the depopulation of all three countries and severe transformational crisis, there was a steady growth of the population size in the regional centres, while the periphery areas of the regions continued to lose the population. The mentioned differences are primarily determined by migration flows, since the fertility rates are below the replacement level in all the countries' territories. Population tends to concentrate in the regional centres, which means urbanisation has not been completed yet. While similar patterns of population decline are observed in the periphery areas of Ukraine and Belarus, in Russia the depopulation rates are negatively influenced by the factor of remoteness of a periphery area from the regional centre. All three countries experienced rural population decline everywhere but suburban areas of the regional centres. © Bulletin of Geography.

Moreover, while these cities have similar CD rates, there are important inter-city differences in the characteristics that make people more or less likely to take part.

In particular we observe that it plays more and more important role in the support of the world economic growth (as well as high prices of certain very important commodities). In the meantime the perspectives of the Chinese economy (as well as possible fates of the Chinese society) remain unclear, whereas respective forecasts look rather contradictory. That is why the search for new aspects and modes of analysis of possible development of China turns out to be rather important for the forecasting of global futures. This article employs a combination of scientific methods that imply (a) the analysis at the level of Chinese economic model; (b) the analysis at regional level (at this level the Chinese economic model is compared with the regional East Asian model); (c) the analysis at the global level that relies on the modified world-system approach that allows to answer the question whether China will replace the USA as the global leader. It is important that the analysis is conducted simultaneously in economic, social, demographic, and political dimensions. As regards the analysis of specific features of the Chinese model as an especial type of the East Asian model (that is based on the export orientation, capital & technology importation, as well as cheap labor force), we note as organic features of the Chinese model the totalitarian power of the Communist Party and the immenseness of resources. As regards special features of the Chinese model, we note (in addition to ""cheap ecology"" and cheap labor force) and emphasize that China has a multilevel (in a way unique) system of growth driving forces, where, as opposed to developed states, the dominant role belongs not to native private capital, but to state corporations, local authorities and foreign business. This explains the peculiarities of the Chinese investment (or rather overinvestment), which determines high growth rate up to a very significant degree. A unique feature of the Chinese model is the competition of provinces and territories for investments and high growth indicators. As regards perspectives of the global hegemony of China, we intend to demonstrate that, on the one hand, economic and political positions of China will strengthen in the forthcoming decades, but, on the other hand, China, assuming all possible future success, will be unable to take the USA position in the World System. We believe that in a direct connection with the development of globalization processes the hegemony cycle pattern is likely to come to its end, which will lead to the World System reconfiguration and the emergence of its new structure that will allow the World System to continue its further development without a hegemon. Finally, the article describes some possible scenarios of the development of China. We demonstrate that China could hardly avoid serious difficulties and critical situations (including those connected with demographic problems); however, there could be different scenarios of how China will deal with the forthcoming crisis. We also come to the conclusion that it would be better for China to achieve a slowdown to moderate growth rates (that would allow China to go through the forthcoming complex transition period with less losses) than to try to return at any cost to explosive growth rates attested in the 2000s. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","China; Demography; Economy; Forecast; Social change; Technological development",,"English",Note,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939872104

Second, most existing models concentrate heavily on the economic forces, frequently neglecting the demographic factor.

As we account for the crucial role of the demographic component in these processes, we show that the timing of the trend change was not coincidental.

The injected microwave signal (~1 GHz) serves the dual purpose of pumping the HEB element and enabling the read-out of the internal state of the device. A cryogenic amplifier amplifies the reflected microwave signal from the device and a homodyne scheme recovers the effects of the incident THz radiation. Two modes of operation have been identified, depending on the level of incident radiation. For weak signals, we use a chopper to chop the incident radiation against a black body reference and a lock-in amplifier to perform synchronous detection of the homodyne readout. The voltage measured is proportional to the incident power, and we estimate an optical noise equivalent power of ~5pW/√Hz at 0.83 THz. At higher signal levels, the homodyne circuit recovers the stream of steady relaxation oscillation pulses from the HEB device. The frequency of these pulses is in the MHz frequency range and bears a linear relationship with the incident THz radiation over an input power range of ~15 dB.

We use a probe frequency of 1.5 GHz. The microwave probe picks up impedance changes of the HEB, which are examined upon demodulation of the reflected wave outside the cryostat. This study shows that the HEB mixer operates in two different regimes under a terahertz pump. At a low pumping level, strong pulse modulation is observed, as the device switches between the superconducting state and the normal state at a rate of a few megahertz. When pumped much harder, to approximate the low-noise mixer operating point, residual modulation can still be observed, showing that the HEB mixer is intrinsically unstable even in the resistive state. Based on these observations, we introduced a low-frequency termination to the HEB mixer. By terminating the device in a 50- Ω resistor in the megahertz frequency range, we have been able to improve the output-power Allan time of our HEB receiver by a factor of four to about 10 s for a detection bandwidth of 15 MHz, with a corresponding gain fluctuation of about 0.035%. © 2014 IEEE.","Allan variance; hot-electron-bolometer mixer; relaxation oscillation; stability","Convergence of numerical methods; Hot electrons; Infrared detectors; Modulation; Optical pumping; Probes; Allan variance; Gain fluctuations; Hot electron bolometer mixer; Megahertz frequencies; Microwave injection; Output power fluctuations; Relaxation oscillation; Superconducting state; Bolometers","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919819696

To study the antenna effect on the mixer performance, we have experimentally studied a set of devices with different size of the Au stripe and spacing between the neighboring stripes. With use of the well-known isotherm technique we have estimated the absorption efficiency of the mixer, and the maximum efficiency has been observed for devices with the smallest pitch of the alternating NbN and NbN-Au stripes. Also, a proper alignment of the incident E-field with respect to the stripes allows us to improve the coupling further. Studying IV-characteristics of the mixer under differently-aligned E-field of the incident radiation, we have noticed a difference in their shape. This observation suggests that a difference exists in the way the two waves with orthogonal polarizations parallel and perpendicular E-field to the stripes heat the electrons in the HEB mixer.

The effect has been observed in models of individual neurons, and in experiments performed on real neural systems. Despite the ubiquity of biophysical sources of stochastic noise in the nervous system, however, it has not yet been established whether neuronal computation mechanisms involved in performance of specific functions such as perception or learning might exploit such noise as an integral component, such that removal of the noise would diminish performance of these functions. In this paper we revisit the methods used to demonstrate stochastic resonance in models of single neurons. This includes a previously unreported observation in a multicompartmental model of a CA1-pyramidal cell. We also discuss, as a contrast to these classical studies, a form of 'stochastic facilitation', known as inverse stochastic resonance.

Here we used a neural microcircuit model to address whether coupled theta-gamma oscillations, as observed in human auditory cortex, could underpin the multiscale sensory analysis of speech. We show that, in continuous speech, theta oscillations can flexibly track the syllabic rhythm and temporally organize the phoneme-level response of gamma neurons into a code that enables syllable identification. The tracking of slow speech fluctuations by theta oscillations, and its coupling to gamma-spiking activity both appeared as critical features for accurate speech encoding.

Drawing on a discourse-theoretical framework that builds on the work of Laclau and Mouffe, the paper examines how the currently most active and visible extreme-right groups in these two countries understand and respond to the crisis as an opportunity to fuel anti-immigration discourses and prey on sentiments of instability and insecurity in the broader population, using online media to “involve members and supporters in the discursive construction of racism”. The analysis demonstrates how these groups look to Greece, as the “crisis epicentre”, for culturalist explanations for the Eurozone crisis and to the rise there of Golden Dawn as an inspiration for future mobilisations in Nordic and pan-European coalitions. © 2015 EURICOM.","Anti-public spheres; Cultural racism; Denmark; European economic crisis; Extreme-right activism; Online media; Sweden",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949678349

She investigates how they structure their work schedule and academic productivity, and how universities with and without special status differ. The study is based on data from two international studies conducted in Russia and other countries: International Academic Profession (1991-93) and Changing Academic Profession (2007-12). In Russia, most university instructors prefer teaching to research, in contrast to the preferences of academics in many other countries. The distribution of the preferences of instructors at institutions with ""research university"" status is no different from that of instructors at institutions without special status. Although the research workload of instructors who prefer to conduct research is greater and the tasks they perform are less routine, they experience less stress and have greater job satisfaction. The author concludes that the distribution of instructors' preferences reflects the peculiarities of the higher education system in the USSR and the Russian Federation, including the focus of its universities on teaching, the allocation of research functions to institutions that are separate from universities, and the poor funding of universities in general and their research functions in particular. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946742341

It was found that college entrants still use traditional forms of preparation despite the new institutional admission conditions at universities. However, it was expected that after the unification of the examination system prospective students would be less likely to resort to extra classes in order to prepare for university entrance. A survey of first-year students and their parents was conducted. It included a total of 1,600 households in the 16 largest Russian cities. A positive relationship was found between monetary investments and time spent on additional preparation courses, on the one hand, and exam results, on the other. However, the return on these investments was low. These results were based on an assessment of a modified function of the educational achievements of students. On the one hand, this means that the results of the USE are connected to the efforts of prospective students, and on the other it shows that those who pursue additional preparation outside of school may gain an advantage by achieving an overall higher score, thereby creating inequality in access to higher education.

The referential flexibility of temporal expressions is well understood in linguistics but its neurocognitive bases remain unknown. We aimed at obtaining a neural signature of shifting times in narrative language. We recorded and analyzed event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and oscillatory responses to the adverb 'now' and to the second main verb in Punctual ('An hour ago the boy stole a candy and now he peeled the fruit') and Iterative ('The entire afternoon the boy stole candy and now he peeled the fruit') contexts. 'An hour ago' introduces a time frame that lies entirely in the past, 'now' shifts the narrative to the present, and 'peeled' shifts it back to the past. These two referential shifts in Punctual contexts are expected to leave very similar traces on neural responses. In contrast, 'The entire afternoon' specifies a time frame that may encompass past, present and future, such that both 'now' and 'peeled' are consistent with it. Here, no time shift is required. We found no difference in ERPs between Punctual and Iterative contexts either at ' now' or at the second verb. However, reference shifts modulated oscillatory signals. 'Now' and the second verb in Punctual contexts resulted in similar responses: an increase in gamma power with a left-anterior distribution. Gamma bursts were absent in Iterative contexts. We propose that gamma oscillations here reflect the binding of temporal variables to the values allowed by constraints introduced by temporal expressions in discourse. © 2015 Brederoo et al.",,"adult; Article; controlled study; event related potential; female; gamma rhythm; grammar; human; human experiment; language; language processing; linguistics; male; narrative; nerve potential; normal human; oscillatory potential; prediction; semantics; stimulus response; brain; evoked response; linguistics; physiology; procedures; time; young adult; Adult; Brain; Evoked Potentials; Female; Humans; Language; Linguistics; Male; Time; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928807112

It is important because, according to the authors, the current structure of the Russian system of higher education is largely determined by how it developed during the Soviet period. It is shown that the Soviet project was built on the idea of administrative regulation of the labor market, and it is argued that it generally implemented a quasi-corporate system model of higher vocational education.

It was changed to a much lesser degree by deliberate government policy. The typology of higher education institutions that results from these changes is described based on an analysis of quantitative data.

It appears that structured extracurricular activities, unlike unstructured ones, correlate with higher self-esteem (both overall and academic), and a stronger sense of belonging in and better satisfaction with school. © 2015 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941614354

Most studies focus on how supralinear summation of excitatory synaptic responses arising from clustered inputs within single dendrites result in the enhancement of neuronal firing, enabling simple computations such as feature detection. Recent reports have shown that sublinear summation is also a prominent dendritic operation, extending the range of subthreshold input-output (sI/O) transformations conferred by dendrites. Like supralinear operations, sublinear dendritic operations also increase the repertoire of neuronal computations, but feature extraction requires different synaptic connectivity strategies for each of these operations. In this article we will review the experimental and theoretical findings describing the biophysical determinants of the three primary classes of dendritic operations: linear, sublinear, and supralinear. We then review a Boolean algebra-based analysis of simplified neuron models, which provides insight into how dendritic operations influence neuronal computations. We highlight how neuronal computations are critically dependent on the interplay of dendritic properties (morphology and voltage-gated channel expression), spiking threshold and distribution of synaptic inputs carrying particular sensory features. Finally, we describe how global (scattered) and local (clustered) integration strategies permit the implementation of similar classes of computations, one example being the object feature binding problem. © 2015 Tran-Van-Minh, Cazé, Abrahamsson, Cathala, Gutkin and DiGregorio.","Binary neruons; Boolean analysis; Dendrites; Input-output transformation; Neural computation; Nonlinear transformations; Uncaging; Votlage activated channels","action potential; Article; connectome; genetic transformation; human; information science; mathematical parameters; membrane conductance; membrane depolarization; membrane potential; protein expression; sensitivity analysis; sensorimotor integration; signal processing; spike wave","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939633639

However, people often act upon self-interest in irrational ways that threaten the long-term survival of the whole group. A lack of sustainable or environmentally responsible behavior is often observed. In this study, we examine how the maximization of benefits principle works in a wider social interactive context of personality preferences in order to gain a more realistic insight into the evolution of cooperation.We used time perspective (TP), a concept reflecting individual differences in orientation towards past, present, or future, and relevant for making sustainable choices.We developed a personalitydriven agent-based model that explores the role of personality in the outcomes of social dilemmas and includes multiple facets of diversity: (1) The agents have different behavior strategies: individual differences derived by applying cluster analysis to survey data from 22 countries (N = 10,940) and resulting in 7 cross-cultural profiles of TP; (2) The non-uniform distribution of the types of agents across countries; (3) The diverse interactions between the agents; and (4) diverse responses to those interactions in a well-mixed population. As one of the results, we introduced an index of overall cooperation for each of the 22 countries, which was validated against cultural, economic, and sustainability indicators (HDI, dimensions of national culture, and Environment Performance Index). It was associated with higher human development, higher individualism, lower power distance, and better environmental performance. The findings illustrate how individual differences in TP can be simulated to predict the ways people in different countries solve the personal vs. common gain dilemma in the global limited-resource situation. This interdisciplinary approach to social simulation can be adopted to explain the possible causes of global environmental issues and to predict their possible outcomes. © 2015 Sircova et al.",,"Article; cluster analysis; controlled study; cooperation; cultural anthropology; data analysis; geographic distribution; health care planning; health care utilization; health survey; human; interdisciplinary communication; interdisciplinary research; personality; population research; resource management; social behavior; social interaction; socioeconomics; statistical model; sustainable development; health care planning; human relation; social environment; theoretical model; Cluster Analysis; Health Resources; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Models, Theoretical; Social Environment","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924401916

However, Moralität involves an individualized form of moral reasoning, whereas Hegelian modern Sittlichkeit involves a social form of moral reasoning based on relations of reciprocal recognition.

We propose a hypothesis that similar mechanisms may be responsible for spontaneous attentional lapses. To address this issue, the auditory condensation task was used. Four target auditory stimuli that differed in 2 independent features were presented randomly with equal probability. Participants were instructed to respond to each stimulus by pressing 1 of 2 buttons according to a rule based on stimulus feature conjunction. Participants made errors in 10.2% ±.7% of the trials and response omissions in 5.4% ±.5% of the trials. The P2 amplitude was greater in trials with errors compared with correct responses, possibly reflecting a reduction of stimulus processing. Spontaneous attentional performance lapses may be tentatively explained by the inadequate distribution of attentional resources caused by competition with other mental processes, such as mind-wandering. This competition is likely to occasionally subdue early preattentional stages of stimulus processing and thus cause behavioral errors. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Attention; Attentional lapses; ERP; P2; Performance","adult; amplitude modulation; Article; attention; attention disturbance; auditory condensation task; auditory evoked potential; auditory stimulation; electroencephalography; electrophysiology; experimental behavioral test; female; hearing test; human; human experiment; male; pure tone audiometry; questionnaire; spontaneous attentional performance lapse; task performance; visual feedback; young adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84968562131

The process interpolates between two extremal cases: the TASEP with parallel update and the process with all particles irreversibly merging into a single cluster moving as an isolated particle. We are interested in the large time behavior of this process on a ring in the whole range of the parameter λ controlling the interaction. We study the stationary state correlations, the cluster size distribution, and the large-time fluctuations of integrated particle current. When λ is finite, we find the usual TASEP-like behavior: The correlation length is finite; there are only clusters of finite size in the stationary state and current fluctuations belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. When λ grows with the system size, so does the correlation length. We find a nontrivial transition regime with clusters of all sizes on the lattice.

Contributing to the debate about neural mechanisms underlying regular and irregular inflectional morphology processing in the mental lexicon, we conducted an fMRI experiment in which participants generated forms from different types of Russian verbs and nouns as well as from nonce stimuli. The data were subjected to a whole brain voxel-wise analysis of context dependent changes in functional connectivity [the so-called psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis]. Unlike previously reported subtractive results that reveal functional segregation between brain areas, PPI provides complementary information showing how these areas are functionally integrated in a particular task. To date, PPI evidence on inflectional morphology has been scarce and only available for inflectionally impoverished English verbs in a same-different judgment task. Using PPI here in conjunction with a production task in an inflectionally rich language, we found that functional connectivity between the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG) was significantly greater for regular real verbs than for irregular ones. Furthermore, we observed a significant positive covariance between the number of mistakes in irregular real verb trials and the increase in functional connectivity between the LIFG and the right anterior cingulate cortex in these trails, as compared to regular ones. Our results therefore allow for dissociation between regularity and processing difficulty effects. These results, on the one hand, shed new light on the functional interplay within the LIFG-bilateral STG language-related network and, on the other hand, call for partial reconsideration of some of the previous findings while stressing the role of functional temporo-frontal connectivity in complex morphological processes. © 2015 Li, Huang, Han, Zhang, Lai, Yuan, Luand Zeng.","Dual-route theories; FMRI; Fronto-temporal brain network; Functional connectivity; Inflectional morphology; Psycho–physiological interactions; Russian; Single-route theories","adult; anterior cingulate; Article; brain region; connectome; decision making; female; frontotemporal brain network; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; inferior frontal gyrus; language ability; language processing; male; normal human; psychophysiologic assessment; psychophysiological interaction analysis; speech intelligibility; superior temporal gyrus","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923259837

To model the appearance of the regions, color, a relatively high dimensional feature, should be handled effectively. A full color histogram is usually too sparse to be reliable. One approach is to explicitly reduce dimensionality by clustering or quantizing the color space. Another popular approach is to fit GMMs for soft implicit clustering of the color space. These approaches work well when the foreground/background are sufficiently distinct. In cases of more subtle difference in appearance, both approaches may reduce or even eliminate foreground/background distinction. This happens because either color clustering is performed completely independently from the segmentation process, as a preprocessing step (in clustering), or independently for the foreground and independently for the background (in GMM). We propose to make clustering an integral part of segmentation, by including a new clustering term in the energy function. Our energy function with a clustering term favours clusterings that make foreground/background appearance more distinct. Thus our energy function jointly optimizes over color clustering, foreground/background models, and segmentation. Exact optimization is not feasible, therefore we develop an approximate algorithm. We show the advantage of including the color clustering term into the energy function on camouflage images, as well as standard segmentation datasets. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Color; Computer vision; Image segmentation; Approximate algorithms; Energy functions; Energy optimization; Foreground/background; High dimensional feature; Joint optimization; Pre-processing step; Segmentation process; Color image processing","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84973902115

(1992) and can be defined as follows. A representation of an n-vertex graph G is said to be implicit if it assigns to each vertex of G a binary code of length O(logn) so that the adjacency of two vertices is a function of their codes. Since an implicit representation of an n-vertex graph uses O(nlogn) bits, any class of graphs admitting such a representation contains 2O(nlogn) labelled graphs with n vertices. In the terminology of Balogh et al. (2000) such classes have at most factorial speed of growth. In this terminology, the implicit graph conjecture can be stated as follows: every class with at most factorial speed of growth which is hereditary admits an implicit representation. The question of deciding whether a given hereditary class has at most factorial speed of growth is far from being trivial. In the present paper, we introduce a number of tools simplifying this question. Some of them can be used to obtain a stronger conclusion on the existence of an implicit representation. We apply our tools to reveal new hereditary classes with the factorial speed of growth. For many of them we show the existence of an implicit representation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The paper also examines the so called evaluation waves, stages of development and methods that have been used at each stage. At present, the government effectiveness evaluation is associated directly with strategic planning and finances. The main question is: to what extent the results obtained impact on further decisions, do the evaluations affect future budgets and policy implementation plans? Special attention is paid to American experience, since the USA is the leader in development and implementation of effective governmental practices. During a long history of such practices in the United States they have undergone numerous significant changes. However, this issue is very complicated and is not fully resolved even at present. The US experience is highly relevant and useful for Russia, where the public administration reform is still important. In Russia there are both projects and measures corresponding with the world tendencies in the government effectiveness evaluation field. At the same time, the adoption of foreign institutions may lead to negative results. The future of evaluation practices in Russia, on federal and regional level, pivots on development of relevant homegrown institutions and mechanisms in compliance with positive and negative international experience.","Effectiveness; Evaluation; Governance; Public administration; USA",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033704526

Despite many theoretical studies, the effects of topological constraints on the equilibrium state of a single compact polymer have not been systematically studied. Here we use simulations to address this longstanding problem. We find that sufficiently long unknotted polymers differ from knotted ones in the spatial and topological states of their subchains. The unknotted globule has subchains that are mostly unknotted and form asymptotically compact RG(s) ∼ s1/3 crumples. However, crumples display a high fractal dimension of the surface db = 2.8, forming excessive contacts and interpenetrating each other.

This λ is a modification of the standard maximal Lyapunov exponent. It is computed here as a function of embedding dimension m, within four-year time windows centered at the maxima of Schwabe cycles. The λ(m) curves form separate clusters (pre-1923 and post-1933). This supports a regime transition and narrows its occurrence to cycle 16, preceding the growth of activity leading to the Modern Maximum. The two regimes are reproduced by a simple autoregressive process AR(1), with the mean of Poisson noise undergoing 11 yr modulation. The autocorrelation a of the process (linked to sunspot lifetime) is a 0.8 for 1850-1923 and 0.95 for 1933-2013. The AR(1) model suggests that groups of spots appear with a Poisson rate and disappear at a constant rate. We further applied the irregularity index to the daily sunspot group number series for the northern and southern hemispheres, provided by the Greenwich Royal Observatory (RGO), in order to study a possible desynchronization. Correlations between the north and south λ(m) curves vary quite strongly with time and indeed show desynchronization. This may reflect a slow change in the dimension of an underlying dynamical system. The ISSN and RGO series of group numbers do not imply an identical mechanism, but both uncover a regime change at a similar time.

This suppression is caused by the effect of Cooper pair dephasing which occurs in the normal metal and defines a new fundamental length scale Lφ in the problem. This length is fully consistent with that derived earlier from the analysis of dissipative electron transport across NS interfaces at subgap energies. Provided the temperature length exceeds Lφ this dephasing length can be conveniently extracted from equilibrium measurements of the Josephson current. © 2015 American Physical Society.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921047265

Electron oscillations in such plasma are of interest in view of resonance absorption or probing of cluster dynamics in experiments. We study the electronic oscillations via molecular dynamics simulations for interacting classical electrons and ions. In particular, surface and volume plasmons are analyzed depending on the cluster size, plasma density, the ion ordering parameter and the short range part of the interaction potential. The volume plasmons are observed only for clusters greater than a threshold cluster size. By means of GPU computing, the long-range Coulomb interactions between particles are treated without typical approximations such as PPPM or TreeMD.","GPGPU; laser plasma; metal cluster; molecular dynamics; strongly coupled plasmas; surface plasmon; volume plasmon","Circuit oscillations; Cluster analysis; Laser produced plasmas; Laser pulses; Plasma density; Plasma interactions; Plasmons; Program processors; Ultrafast lasers; Ultrashort pulses; GPGPU; Laser plasma; Metal cluster; Strongly coupled plasma; Surface plasmons; Volume plasmon; Molecular dynamics","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919627303

on levels and trends for age-sex-specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality is essential for the formation of global, regional, and national health policies. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 (GBD 2013) we estimated yearly deaths for 188 countries between 1990, and 2013. We used the results to assess whether there is epidemiological convergence across countries. Methods We estimated age-sex-specific all-cause mortality using the GBD 2010 methods with some refinements to improve accuracy applied to an updated database of vital registration, survey, and census data. We generally estimated cause of death as in the GBD 2010. Key improvements included the addition of more recent vital registration data for 72 countries, an updated verbal autopsy literature review, two new and detailed data systems for China, and more detail for Mexico, UK, Turkey, and Russia. We improved statistical models for garbage code redistribution. We used six different modelling strategies across the 240 causes; cause of death ensemble modelling (CODEm) was the dominant strategy for causes with sufficient information. Trends for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were informed by meta-regression of prevalence studies. For pathogen-specific causes of diarrhoea and lower respiratory infections we used a counterfactual approach. We computed two measures of convergence (inequality) across countries: the average relative difference across all pairs of countries (Gini coefficient) and the average absolute difference across countries. To summarise broad findings, we used multiple decrement life-tables to decompose probabilities of death from birth to exact age 15 years, from exact age 15 years to exact age 50 years, and from exact age 50 years to exact age 75 years, and life expectancy at birth into major causes. For all quantities reported, we computed 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). We constrained cause-specific fractions within each age-sex-country-year group to sum to all-cause mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions. Findings Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65·3 years (UI 65·0-65·6) in 1990, to 71·5 years (UI 71·0-71·9) in 2013, while the number of deaths increased from 47·5 million (UI 46·8-48·2) to 54·9 million (UI 53·6-56·3) over the same interval. Global progress masked variation by age and sex: for children, average absolute differences between countries decreased but relative differences increased. For women aged 25-39 years and older than 75 years and for men aged 20-49 years and 65 years and older, both absolute and relative differences increased. Decomposition of global and regional life expectancy showed the prominent role of reductions in age-standardised death rates for cardiovascular diseases and cancers in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and neonatal causes in low-income regions. HIV/AIDS reduced life expectancy in southern sub-Saharan Africa. For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell whereas for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts have increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates. Global deaths from injury increased by 10·7%, from 4·3 million deaths in 1990 to 4·8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%. For some causes of more than 100 000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, pancreatic cancer, atrial fibrillation and flutter, drug use disorders, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and sickle-cell anaemias. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes, and malaria are still in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important pathogens are rotavirus for diarrhoea and pneumococcus for lower respiratory infections. Country-specific probabilities of death over three phases of life were substantially varied between and within regions. Interpretation For most countries, the general pattern of reductions in age-sex specific mortality has been associated with a progressive shift towards a larger share of the remaining deaths caused by non-communicable disease and injuries. Assessing epidemiological convergence across countries depends on whether an absolute or relative measure of inequality is used. Nevertheless, age-standardised death rates for seven substantial causes are increasing, suggesting the potential for reversals in some countries. Important gaps exist in the empirical data for cause of death estimates for some countries; for example, no national data for India are available for the past decade.

The paper points to the discrepancy between the engineering concept of energy efficiency and the energy intensity as it is understood in macroeconomic statistics. This double discrepancy concerns definitions (while engineering concept of energy efficiency is based on the thermodynamic definition, energy intensity includes economic measures) and use. With regard to the latter, the authors conclude that energy intensity can only provide indirect and delayed evidence of technological and engineering energy efficiency of energy conversion processes, which entails shortcomings for management and policymaking. Therefore, we suggest to stop considering subsectoral, sectoral and other levels of energy intensities as aggregates of lower-level energy efficiency. It is suggested that the insufficiency of energy intensity indicators can be compensated with the introduction of thermodynamic indicators describing energy efficiency at the physical, technological, enterprise, sub-sector, sectoral and national levels without references to any economic or financial parameters. Structured statistical data on thermodynamic efficiency is offered as a better option for identifying break-through technologies and technological bottle-necks that constrain efficiency advancements. It is also suggested that macro-level thermodynamic indicators should be based on the thermodynamic first law efficiency and the energy quality problem may be left to enterprise-level thermoeconomic optimization. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy efficiency; Energy intensity; Energy management; Thermodynamics","Bottles; Economics; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Thermodynamics; Energy intensity; Engineering concepts; Equivalent measure; Financial parameters; First law efficiency; Thermodynamic efficiency; Thermodynamic indicators; Thermoeconomic optimization; Energy efficiency; data set; econometrics; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy policy; macroeconomics; thermodynamics","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910012860

Fowles' literary works. Concepts of CREATIVITY and FREEDOM occupy the central place in Fowles' picture of the world and, consequently, they are represented in all his works. Three novels (The Collector, The Magus, Daniel Martin) and a story The Ebony Tower were chosen for the analysis because together they form an author's text. They possess similarity both on the thematic level (all of them foregrounding the topic of creativity) and on the composition and stylistic levels (all of them using postmodernist principles of text construction). Study of the author's text in contrast to separately taken texts makes it possible to outline changes within the author's picture of the world, especially, changes of particular elements, such as the image of artist. Stable components of the author's picture of the world are formed by the opposition of a young and a mature artist as well as by the correlation of the concepts of CREATIVITY and FREEDOM. Dynamics is reflected in the changing heroes' attitude to freedom (constantly viewed as an indispensable condition for creativity) and ways of its acquisition. The concept of FREEDOM is represented through the opposition of limited and unlimited space. In each of the analysed works this opposition acquires different spatial characteristics, in accordance with Fowles' intention. The evolution of the author's picture of the world is reflected in the variability of spatial characteristics of the opposition ""freedom vs. non-freedom"". Moreover, it is observed in the modified meaning of a limited space, which initially represents non-freedom but gradually starts to be associated with freedom. Young artists need to see the world and gain experience to be able to create, thus, they look for freedom in open spaces. Being in a limited space (such as a cave or a cellar) is uncomfortable for them, although it may provide them with an opportunity for self-reflection that enables artists to develop spiritually and artistically. Mature artists tend to hide from the outer world and search for freedom in closed limited spaces (such as a house or a farm), where they can think and create.","Artist; Author's text; Creativity; Freedom; J.

Relating to this, academic discourse research and discourse strategies of scientific knowledge transferring are in the focus of special attention. As far as English written academic discourse in Economics is underestimated in the process of studying, this research is of great timeliness. Discourse markers (DMs) play an important role in the process of text generation, in providing discourse grammar and sense integrity and optimization in transferring information from addresser to addressee. But beyond modern research are the aspects of DMs functioning depending on the level of students' professional and communicative competences. This article focuses on special features of discourse markers in academic discourse in Economics. It is based on English written texts produced by Russian students majoring in Economics with different competence. The main objective is to reveal the difference of discourse markers functioning in terms of the level of students' foreign language professional competence. The authors succeeded in extending the DMs classification. Qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed the peculiarities of DMs functioning in academic discourse in Economics. The prevailing DMs are those which introduce new or additional information, taking the leading position in professional discourse in comparison with nonprofessional one. The second and the third position in both discourses belong to the contrastive DMs and DMs of author's assessment. However, the qualitative analysis revealed that written texts of professional discourse highlighted the tendency of using DMs of different groups. It can be explained by students' high level of professional skills and, thus, by their ability to transfer scientific knowledge (by their high communicative competence). The peculiarity of DMs functioning in nonprofessional discourse is the occurrence of the same maker or monotony in using markers in one written text. It can be explained by the lack of ability to use the cognitivecommunicative strategy in transferring economic knowledge effectively. The research allows to substantially specify the understanding of creating and transferring the special knowledge process in English by non-natives. Moreover, it enables us to expand the understanding of academic discourse in a special sphere. The developed data can be the basis for differentiating academic discourse, heterogeneous in its learning. DMs functioning regularities in terms of the level of foreign language professional competence are identified. Also, the prospects for further research in the sphere of DMs in academic discourse functioning are determined.","Academic discourse; Academic discourse in economics; Discourse markers; Foreign language professional competence",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055975760

The study is informed by socio-cognitive approach in critical discourse analysis (CDA). It is contended that the key form of social cognition that can be drawn upon in both aforementioned functions is the concept of values, which can be understood in three basic ways: as normative beliefs, value concepts and personal values. The focus of linguistic analysis is the language of appraisal in two text instances recontextualizing two social practices, those of 'grooming' and 'dating'. The first text evaluates the elements of the practice primarily in terms of 'appreciation'-one of the three semantic areas of appraisal; the other two being 'affect' and 'judgement'. The second text evaluates specific ways of acting within the social practice of dating through deployment of language resources of judgement and affect. Following the analysis of text instances, it is argued that the discursive function of values can be seen as twofold. On the one hand, specific instances of appraisal in discourse invoke values (that have been interpreted and conceptualized elsewhere) to legitimize a certain social practice. Rhetorically, this move can be interpreted as geared towards promoting and advertising specific goods and services which are being naturalized as an integral part of the legitimized practice. This is exemplified by the way the first text naturalizes the use of specific grooming products. Alternatively, this move can be interpreted as a way of promoting the magazine (and the whole genre) itself through building strong solidarity with the putative addressee-a strategy which is arguably instantiated by the second text. On the other hand, discursive recontextualization of such practices can be seen as a 'system of interpretation' aimed at ad hoc (re)conceptualizing and (re)negotiating specific values-a process that may contribute to formation of new values on the part of the addressee through abstraction and decontextualization. All the above mentioned effects can be also interpreted in a broader CDA perspective as instances of reproducing social power. Specifically, they can be seen as reproducing the ideology of consumerism characterized by the so called commodification of all aspects of life and naturalization of consumer identity. In this respect, the analyzed texts with their specific language usage effectively accommodate a consumer position for the putative addressee-a consumer of specific goods and services and a consumer of the magazine and the 'lifestyle' that it sells in general.","Axiology; Critical discourse analysis; Discourse of consumerism; Evaluation; Identity; Legitimation; Men's magazines; Social practice; Value",,"Russian",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055972925

The judgement by Deleuze concerning Kant's critical philosophy and Husserl's transcendental philosophy seems to be an example of the failed philosophical dialogue, this time between post-structuralism and (classical as well as modern) transcendentalism. Deleuze sees in transcendental philosophy the dominance of the twofold instance of the common sense; the two forms are the sensus communis (which dominated already in Kant) and the bona mens (which crystallized in the Husserlian Urdoxa). Even if one could agree that the poststructuralist reading of transcendental philosophy is likely sometimes too rash, it is still helpful. One can then see that at the center of the research-field of transcendental phenomenology a real nodal point of paradoxes remains: first of all, the so-called «paradox of human subjectivity» - the relation between the empirical and the transcendental, which seems to be paradoxical for sound human understanding. One could contrast here the goal of transcendental research, which consists in sense-building and sense-enrichment, with the poststructuralist art of the forming, inventing and production of concepts. The passion for paradoxes, the provocation of the sound human understanding as a motor of thinking (characteristic of poststructuralism) is still bound to doxa and to the common sense, although it tries to «turn it inside out». Transcendental philosophy tries rather to take a «step back» from the solidification of common sense in order to observe the sense-building in statu nascendi. © Georgy Chernavin, 2015.","Common sense; Deleuze; Doxa; Husserl; Paradox; Poststructuralism; Transcendental philosophy",,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049903273

What is problematic about any problem whatsoever, philosophical or otherwise? As the origin of assertion and apodeiction, the problematic suspends the categories of necessity and contingency, possibility and impossibility. And it is this suspension that is the essence of the problem, which is why it is so suspenseful. But then, how is the problem problematic? Only if what is suspended neither comes to presence, nor simply goes out into absence, that is, if the suspension continues, which continues the problem. But what is problematic about suspension? As a consideration of language shows, the problem of suspension is the problem of implication. If being, for example, is merely implied, neither present nor absent, then it is the suspension of both, at least insofar as it is problematic. And this not only says something about language; rather, it has ontological implications as well - it speaks of being, and the being of anything whatsoever. For if being is implied, if that is the problem of being, it is because being is an implication. Then the being of things like problems is implied as well; or being is in things by implication. But what does it mean for being to be neither presence nor absence, but an implication? It means that being is implied in a way that is problematic - before it is necessary, or even possible. For being's way of being is characterized by suspension - which has implications for thinking and speaking about being, and about things like problems, even about anything whatsoever. And this has implications for what being implies, namely, unity and time and aspect. © ANDREW HAAS, 2015.","Apodeictic; Aspect; Assertoric; Being; Implication; Problematic; Suspension; Time; Unity",,"English",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049893541

Most of migrant applications were proposed by construction and manufacturing industries. Employers prefer to hire low-skilled migrants with secondary education and with work experience of 1 year.

Internationally, its weakness was associated with the capital outflow from all emerging markets as a result of QE's tapering in the US. Domestically, rand plummeted because of the deterioration of the macroeconomic stance of South Africa itself: economic growth stalled and current account deficit widened again. Consumer spending was restrained with the high household indebtedness, investment climate worsened with the wave of bloody strikes, and net export was still prone to J-curve effect despite the degree of the devaluation happened. But, in its turn, those problems are a mere reflection of the deep institutional disbalances inherent to the very model of the national economy. Saving rate is too low in South Africa. This leads not only to an insufficient investment, but also to trade deficits and overdependence on speculative capital inflows. Extremely high unemployment means that the country's economic potential is substantially underutilized. Joblessness is generated, first and foremost, by the dualistic structure of the national entrepreneurship. Basic wages are being formed by way of a bargaining between big public and parastatal companies, on the one hand, and trade unions associated with the ruling party, on the other. Such a system is biased towards protection of vested interests of those who earn money in capital-intensive industries. At the same time, these rates of wages are prohibitively high for a small business; so far private companies tend to avoid job creation. A new impulse to economic development is likely to emerge only through the government's efforts to mitigate disproportions and to pursue an active industrial policy. National Development Plan adopted in 2012 is a practical step in that direction. But the growth of public investment is constrained by a necessity of fiscal austerity, since the budget deficit remained too large in recent years. South African Reserve Bank will have to choose between a stimulation of economic growth with low interest rates, on the one hand, and a support of rand by tightening of monetary policy, on the other. This dilemma will greatly influence prices of securities and yields at South African financial markets.","Current account deficit; Devaluation; Emerging markets; Gini coefficient; Industrial policy; Investment.; Saving; Social policy; South Africa; Unemployment",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033684773

The situation with informational openness in Russian education can be described as an extensive development of information resources being performed mostly under the influence of governmental regulatory control.

Dynamic network analysis answers the question, how specific forms of student behavior, like bad habits, develop and propagate. It is also helpful in following how school or university students enter into friendship or antagonism with each other, as well as in assessing the impact social relations have on academic performance. The paper gives a review of the two key methods used for empirical analysis of social network dynamics. Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOM) represent one of the most elaborated techniques of social network dynamics investigation. This approach regards the present state of a network as dependable on its preceding state uniquely. Network evolution appears to be continuous, not discrete, so that a structural macro change is, in fact, a multitude of micro changes. Instead of dealing with structure of the network and prerequisites for its development, the SAOM model studies the processes underlying any changes recorded. Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (STERGM) are an alternative approach towards research on social network dynamics. In this case, the social network observed is a materialization of one of possible networks with predetermined characteristics. Any network develops in the result of a stochastic process, and the research should be aimed at discovering what forces this process is driven by. Comparison of an empirically discovered network with networks of similar size reveals structural features of the network and characteristics of actors who influenced the process of its establishment. In this paper, we also give an example of how both models can be used with the same set of data.","Academic performance; Deviant behavior; Separable Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models; Social networks; Statistical-dynamical models; Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027465920

That was the key to success of the Soviet illiteracy eradication campaign. None of the countries that used the Soviet scheme in their enlightenment projects cold replicate this success, as people were taught literacy with the traditional social relationships being preserved.

We believe that this potential is determined in the present context by the leadership style which suggests cooperation with teachers in decision-making processes and delegating them responsibilities under conditions of uncertainty and high cognitively complex tasks. Using the two-factor leadership model proposed by Bernard M. Bass, we suggest that either transformational or transactional leadership style may be efficient depending on school situation. Consequently, two types of leaders may be the most efficient in terms of school reformation: (1) principals with the conceptual decision-making style as dominant and the analy tical one as backup- they are ready to make changes and are likely already implementing them; (2) principals with the analytical leadership style as dominant and the conceptual one as backup-they are potentially prepared to adapt under changing conditions or if required to change by external influences. Assessment of the reformist potential among the existing school principal staff in Russia shows only 12% of school principals in eight regions apply the conceptual decision-making style having a backup analytical style- it's them who can be classified as transformational leaders.

The principal limitations of the Arctic Council lie outside of the institution's agenda and scope. Geopolitical differences and conflicts that do not directly relate to the Arctic region, such as the conflict in Ukraine, can potentially disrupt the council's activities.

The study is based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of references to international institutions in the BRICS documents, identifying and examining the models, intensity and distribution of interactions. The findings of the study suggest that the dynamics of BRICS engagement with other international institutions is positive. However, despite the increase in the absolute number of references, a decrease in their intensity is observed. This trend persists in spite of the expansion of BRICS agenda and the establishment of cooperation mechanisms involving BRICS and other international institutions in new areas. BRICS engagement with international institutions is characterized by two basic models: the ""catalyst"" approach and ""parallel treatment"". In addition, BRICS countries use mechanisms for coordinating their positions in international institutions on issues relevant to their agenda and broader policy areas. The establishment of the BRICS own institutions has not led to a noticeable decrease in the number and intensity of references to other international organizations. Thus, the BRICS and its New Development Bank and Contingent Reserve Arrangement should not be considered as one more tool for the development of multilateralism and coordination rather than alternatives or competitors to the existing international institutions. The analysis leads to the conclusion that to further enhance the effectiveness of global governance mechanisms it is necessary for BRICS to intensify its cooperation with other institutions, giving the priority to leadership in setting their priorities and identifying new areas of work, concrete decisions to support them, delegation of mandates and development of mechanisms for coordinating the positions of the five countries rather than just discussing the institutions' activities.","""catalyst"" approach; ""parallel treatment""; BRICS; International institutions; Models of engagement with international institutions",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021349361

International relations is currently in a process of transformation, related to the dramatic increase in opportunities for transborder interaction among different communities and social groups. The result could be the creation of the new identity that exists beyond the states' borders. The wide practice of the transborder contacts increases the significance of values and ideology in international interaction. At the same time, the background for the transformation of international relations is the globalization that exacerbates the socioeconomic divide, the political divide and the value divide. As the result, there is an exponential increase in global political uncertainty and the international weakness of states. One effective remedy to systematize interactions and eliminate uncertainty is the establishment of complex institutional structures, which reflect the convictions and values of societies and communities in the course of history. Therefore, building appropriate institutes can significantly ease many existing international problems, including ones connected with the changing international environment. Another important thing is to provide mutual benefits for all involved actors. Otherwise, the established systems would not be significantly efficient. The decrease in the international capacities of the states also appears in the decrease of the hard power source to promote national interests. The significance of soft power is constantly rising. However, soft power does not involve direct action regarding the politics of other states. Smart power, which combines hard power for compulsion and vengeance and soft power for persuasion and attraction, is more effective and adequate. An actor's capacity to promote smart power is closely linked with contextual intellect and existing path dependence rooted in culture and historical experience, which shapes the collective cognition and perception of events and occurrences. Such factors directly influence the process of international institutionalization. In analyzing smart power aspects, this article draws attention to the concept of the ""three faces of power."" In addition, it points out the determinant meaning of security in international processes, which accounts for most important decisions of elites in the process of definization, the process of decision making regarding the national interests. Improving security can be treated as decreasing uncertainty, including by means of institutionalization and collective smart power implementation.","ASEAN; Asia-Pacific region; China; Culture; Definization; Hard power; Institutional changes; Securitization; Security; Smart power; Soft power; South-East Asia; Strategy; Uncertainty; United States",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021338253

Using stochastic actor- based models, we demarcated the boundaries between social selection and social influence evaluated through academic performance. Having analyzed the dynamics of friendship ties and academic achievements throughout the first year at university, we discovered that students were not guided by the level of academic performance when choosing friends among peers but academic achievements of the latter affected their own performance over time. This could be explained by social segregation of students based on their academic outcomes.","Academic achievement; Academic outcomes; Academic performance; Dynamic statistical models; Effects of co-learning; Friendship ties; Higher education; Social networks; Stochastic actor-based models",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020522487

All narratives can be integrated and described under the metaphor of a trial. In the most blatant form, the discourse is constructed in a prosecutor style, but attorney- and judge-like speeches also blame students for the high attrition rates. All the three types of discourse build figurative barriers between the university and professors on the one hand and students on the other. These barriers encourage professors to feel uninvolved in student attrition. None of the discourse types phrased the university mission or problematized the principles and goals of university activities. We suggest that the ""bad student"" discourse reflects some real problems associated with massification of education and with inevitable changes to the student body. Professor discourse analysis makes it possible to assume that response to these changes is restricted to stating the problems and disassociating oneself from them. Construction of figurative barriers may result in professors' self-distancing not only from students but also from the changes affecting the education system. Such self-distancing complicates the process of adaptation to changes, making it poorly controllable.","Discourse analysis; Education reformation; Higher education; Student attrition; University mission",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017189418

At the second part of the article we briefly describe an educational program for parents which we have developed and results of our empirical study of factors affecting parental self-efficacy which we used as a basis.

The crucial point of most of the chapters included in the volume is a thorough analysis of Orientalism and its implications to current Islamic Studies. Beginning with a critique of the sociology of Max Weber, which Turner believes to have created the modern false paradigm in Islamic studies, he then methodically identifies obvious and hidden forms of Orientalism, demonstrating how to try avoiding it in research.

In his linguistic thought, De Raey criticized philosophers such as Hobbes, who supposedly deprived Aristotelian terminology of any reference and meaningful use. The analysis of De Raey testifies to the emergence of the philosophy of language out of the double traditions of logic and metaphysics.

A distinctive feature of the proposed approach is the use of conceptual exploration techniques, which make it possible to organize the process of ontology construction by automatically identifying and explicitly highlighting issues that remain to be addressed. Given a set of objects (facts, situations, etc.) of a subject domain, which is known to have considerably more such objects, and their unified descriptions in terms of presence or absence of certain attributes, a conceptual exploration system maintains a compact representation of implications behind the currently built ontology and offers them for experts to accept or falsify by entering new objects or extending the description language with new attributes. Upon termination, exploration results in identification of a (relatively small) representative part of the domain from which a conceptual hierarchy of the entire domain can be automatically constructed. We consider theoretic, algorithmic, representational, and pragmatic issues of transforming the exploration methods into a toolset useful for domain experts.

According to this style of legal thinking, such internal rationality impedes law from being chaotically or randomly organized and structured. Therefore, law shall have a reasonably organized structure, even if in reality it does not have such a structure. In this way, the belief in an internal rationality of law transforms itself into the requirement for the rational organization of law. These two elements - belief in an internal rationality and the requirement of the rational organization of law - are the pillars of the dogmatic conception of law which was established in Begriffsjurisprudenz of the 19 th century and which still holds sway over contemporary continental legal thinking. © 2015, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

Despite heavy criticism that came down on the Constitutional Court for what was seen by law enforcement agents as unwarranted judicial activism, the Russian Parliament soon amended the article in line with the interpretation offered by the Court. This, however, did not end the controversy as critics raised a valid point: an automatic transfer of facts from civil proceedings with a priori more lenient requirements of proof is likely to distort outcomes, harming defendants, the prosecution, and, ultimately, societal interests. This article will turn for a potential solution to common law, which has been able to avoid this problem by clearly distinguishing between different standards of proof applicable in civil v. criminal litigations. It will be shown, using the United States as an example, how courts can effectively use issue preclusion to pursue a number of legitimate objectives, such as consistency of judgments and judicial economy, with due account for the interests of parties in proceedings. At the same time, issue preclusion appears an inappropriate and ineffective means to combat arbitrariness of the judiciary - the end which Russia’s Constitutional Court and law makers arguably had in mind when introducing the doctrine into Russian law. © 2015, Supporting Academic Initiatives Foundation.

The basis for this approach is the static swarm model characterised by the absence of a set control centre; it represents the network fixed at some time interval as a set of locally interacting agents. A task of cooperative hunting by distributed mobile robots based on local interaction was considered. Two strategies were used for the hunting task solution: individual hunting and pack-hunting.

It begins by comparing the key multilateral development banks (World Bank, Asian Development Bank, African Development Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) and national development banks of the BRICS countries with the newly established institution. The NDB's purpose is to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in the member countries. This purpose, as author concludes on the base of the analysis, partly duplicates the work of the existing institutions. However, the NDB could add to the functions of the existing institutions and become a significant development bank for its members. The best way to achieve this significance is to implement multilateral projects in the areas mentioned above. The article also examines the current role of the BRICS countries in the global financial architecture and the potential for an increased role, brought by the establishment of the BRICS bank. The founding countries of the NDB will jointly determine the volume and directions of its financial aid. In addition, in contrast to the Bretton Woods institutions, the BRICS countries can change the rules of the development financial aid, particularly the conditions and system for monitoring results. The article concludes that the BRICS countries have created a possible way to change the current system of development finance and therefore to increase the role of the BRICS countries in the global financial architecture.","BRICS; Development finance; Global financial architecture; New development bank; Sustainable development",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957962330

This makes them especially useful for the rapid visual categorization of multiple objects of different types that are intermixed in space. Rapid categorization implies our ability to judge at one brief glance whether all visible objects represent different types or just variants of one type. A framework presented here states that processes resembling statistical tests can underlie that categorization. At an early stage (primary categorization), when independent ensemble properties are distributed along a single sensory dimension, the shape of that distribution is tested in order to establish whether all features can be represented by a single or multiple peaks. When primary categories are separated, the visual system either reiterates the shape test to recognize subcategories (indepth processing) or implements mean comparison tests to match several primary categories along a new dimension. Rapid categorization is not free from processing limitations; the role of selective attention in categorization is discussed in light of these limitations. © 2015 ARVO.","Attention; Categorization; Ensemble summary statistics; Statistical tests","biostatistics; human; physiology; spatial behavior; statistical model; vision; Biostatistics; Humans; Models, Statistical; Spatial Processing; Visual Perception","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955686989

While usually the predicates are classified on the basis whether they can potentially be used with dative subject, I study the trends for explicit use of dative (or prepositional beneficiary arguments) among the ""dative subject predicates"", and show that the frequency rates of real use of dative subjects can be very different with different predicates. Separate analysis of different morphological forms of the same dative subject lexeme (i.e. adjectives in full and short forms, comparative adjectives and predicatives) shows that they may also exhibit different strategies with explicit dative subjects.

Historically, the particle by in conjunctions can be traced back to the marker of subjunctive. Synchronically, however, the group is not homogenous. The aim of the paper is to find out which of the conjunctions with by should be considered as containing the marker of subjunctive, and test whether the particle can or can not be separated from the conjunction. Four criteria are used. The first and the second, namely, (a) the forms available in the subordinate clause with the conjunction and (b) the possibility of repetition of the particle by with the second predicate shows that comparative conjunctions do not synchronically contain the subjunctive marker.

Annotated suffix trees are an extension of the original suffix tree data structure, with nodes labeled by occurrence frequencies for corresponding substrings in the input text collection. They have a range of interesting applications in text analysis, such as language-independent computation of a matching score for a keyphrase against some text collection. In our enhanced implementation, new algorithms and data structures (suffix arrays used instead of the traditional but heavyweight suffix trees) have enabled us to derive an implementation superior to the previous ones in terms of both memory consumption (10 times less memory) and runtime. We describe an open-source statistical text analysis software package, called “EAST”, which implements this enhanced annotated suffix tree method. Besides, the EAST package includes an adaptation of a distributional synonym extraction algorithm that supports the Russian language and allows us to achieve better results in keyphrase matching. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Algorithms on strings; Annotated suffix trees; Suffix arrays; Synonym extraction; Text analysis","Algorithms; Computational linguistics; Data structures; Extraction; Forestry; Image matching; Open source software; Open systems; Semantics; Trees (mathematics); Algorithms and data structures; Extraction algorithms; Language independents; Memory consumption; Suffix arrays; Suffix Tree Data Structures; Suffix-trees; Text analysis; Image analysis","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951871897

Many approaches have been proposed. One is to build a graph over the set of objects from a given database and use a greedy walk as a basis for a search algorithm. If the greedy walk has an ability to find the nearest neighbor in the graph starting from any vertex with a small number of steps, such a graph is called a navigable small world. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for building graphs with navigable small world properties. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it is free from input parameters and has an ability to adapt on the fly to any changes in the distribution of data. The algorithm is based on the idea of removing local minimums by adding new edges. We realize this idea to improve search properties of the structure by using the set of queries in the execution stage.

The conclusion is drawn that social capital is the basic engine of investigated communities. The social capital accumulated by users increases the community commitment and cohesion by interpreting gifts as a set of resources to distribute fairly.

Special attention is devoted to omissions of metrical stress and the development of differences in the rhythmic profile of the English, Dutch, German, and Russian iamb. The study investigates the link between the average number of syllables in the rhythmic words of each language and the degree of strictness in the realization of metrical structure. The results we have obtained give grounds for considering that the length of words is not-as scholars have previously thought-the decisive factor in allowing verse to free itself from its metrical bounds. A comparative analysis of identical types of versification in different languages allows us to view this issue quite differently. It frequently turns out that not the linguistic but the historical conditions of creating of the new versification have the decisive influence on the nature of the interaction between meter and language.

Therefore, a creation of provincial administration, magistracies and military prefecture in the region are considered. An analysis of literary, epigraphic and archaeological sources shows that the process of political change in Germania implied neither uniformity nor synchronism and the ways to transform political life on the barbarian periphery were numerous. They varied from a complete assimilation of Germanic communities to no more than superficial political subjugation of neighboring client states.","Germania; Germania inferior; Municipalisation; Oppidum batavorum; Provincialization; Waldgirmes",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950309827

Features of political communication in Russian-speaking segment of the Facebook network are analyzed in the article. According to researchers unlike their counterparts in the U.S. and elsewhere, Russian bloggers prefer platforms that combine features typical of blogs with features of social network services like Facebook. The data were collected into a complicated political period (violent events in Ukraine), which is considerably stimulated the activity of the Russian opposition and manipulative processes in the Russian social networks. Objectives. The objectives were: classification of actors in the political groups in the Russian-speaking segment of Facebook and analysis of their sociolinguistic behavior. Method. The interdisciplinary analysis based on scope of politically active groups (N 200) and actors (N 291) during January - May, 2014. Results. Actors were classified by politic opinions into mainstream, oppositional and nationalist Clusters and based on network activity into designers of communication space, manipulators, graphomaniacs and local cluster authors. Their communicative and speech behavior was also analyzed and shown shaped specific virtual identities, which demonstrate distinguished sociolinguistic behavior. Discussion and Conclusion. Today the analysis of communication processes in politically active communities in the network environment is of great importance as the virtual sphere becomes more and more significant for achieve of various political aims both in Russia and around the world. The prospect of an actual study is to identify the ratio of online and off-line communication activity of actors in the political sphere in the Russian segment of Facebook. © 2015, University of La Laguna.

This article provides an analysis of theoretical approaches to the construction of bond liquidity integral indices and reviews existing practice in the Russian market. First, it compares methodologies of Russian investment banks (Trust, Gazprombank, Zenith and others) and a new cyclic algorithm introduced by Thomson Reuters Agency (TRLI 2015). In empirical part of our research Thomson Reuters’ integral indices of bond liquidity (weighted and non-weighted) are tested in the context of explaining the difference in yields of 1118 Russian national currency bonds outstanding (including government, municipal and corporate bonds). The multi-factor cross-sectional regression analysis results show that the influence of both Thomson Reuters liquidity indices on Russian bond yields is fairly stable. Duration and S&P rating also exert stable influence on bond yields. The non-weighted liquidity index has better explanatory power than the weighted one. © 2015, Journal of Applied Economic Sciences.

Present in the work of Durkheim and most scholars of the sacred, as well as in actual social practice, the impure sacred is not the profane, the sphere that opposes the sacred. However, in most interpretations of Durkheim, and even in aspects of his own argument, the ambiguity of the sacred is neglected and, in several important cases, treated as if it were profane: this has negative consequences for cultural sociology and the study of culture in contemporary society. In certain cases, the impure sacred and the profane can be hard to tell apart. Yet, if the boundaries between the sacred (pure and impure) and the profane are not clearly distinguished, the overall approach to culture in terms of distinctions and boundaries loses its logical and theoretical coherence. This article elucidates the ambiguity of the sacred and reintegrates that ambiguity into cultural sociology. The model proposed here treats the impure as a transient result of violation of the sacred/profane border with no independent status of its own. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013.","Ambiguity of the sacred; anthropology; cultural sociology; Durkheim; impure sacred; religion; sacred and profane",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948708209

Russian workers receive wage compensations for living in regions with a higher price level and worse nonpecuniary characteristics, such as a relatively low life expectancy, a high level of air pollution, poor medical services, a colder climate, and a higher unemployment level. These compensations are not associated with the existing government system of compensating wage coefficients. After adjusting for regional amenities and disamenities, regionalwages become positively correlated with interregionalmigration flows.

Methodology/approach - The chapter provides a summary of the existing literature on corporate parenting styles and uncovers the missing elements in the theoretical constructs. New theoretical constructs fill the gaps. Findings - The chapter presents a new typology of corporate parenting style by combining corporate parents' processes of adding value to and extracting value from subsidiaries. The five-type typology of corporate styles outlines the different levels of value addition and value extraction and various degrees of reciprocity in both processes. This chapter determines the most important factors that affect the selection of corporate parenting style. It postulates that the multinational corporation should exhibit different parenting styles toward its subsidiaries simultaneously and should be ready to amend its parenting styles to reflect changes in a subsidiary's strategy and its motives for corporate ownership. Research limitations/implications - A new agenda for empirical studies oriented toward variability of parenting styles is proposed. Empirical tests of our propositions are needed. I encourage researchers to extend our research by considering the regional (supra-national), industry, and individual levels of analyses. Originality/value - The chapter provides a more realistic view of corporate parenting styles than that found in the previous literature and outlines promising directions for further theoretical and empirical research.

It is caused by the fact that in such models profits are not used to increase the total annual supply, and the interest rate for the calculation of the TVM should reflect the effectiveness of cash flow of supply chain itself. A new formula considering the TVM for EOQ is found.

Therefore, the issues of credit risk modeling showed the shortcomings of the current credit risk practice. Truncation, or partial observability, and simultaneous equations bias causes sample selection bias. As a result, parameter estimates are biased and inconsistent. Firstly, we provide an overview of current approaches in the mortgage literature to control for the sample selection bias correction, such as the Heckman model and bivariate probit model with selection. Secondly, a review of the most significant mortgage studies discussing this problem is introduced. Specifically, different structural models, specific datasets and empirical results are regarded.

Official governmental reports regarding the implementation of the national project “Health” focus only on the material component of the reform process, namely the quantity of purchased equipment and the amount of funding spent. Until now, there has been little assessment of the sociopolitical processes involved in reforming the health care system and little understanding of whether the socioeconomic status and prestige of the medical profession have improved. This chapter seeks to fill that gap. The empirical data reported in this chapter is based on national statistics on health care reform (1995–2011) and several mass surveys of Russian physicians and the population, namely the Russian longitude monitoring survey (RLMS-HSE, HSE, 2005–2011, N = 12641), and “The prestige of the medical profession in Russian society” (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, HSE, 2011, N = 120).

When solemnly entering a city, the riding prince used to be surrounded by criminals, previously convicted by local courts and sentenced to exile. He brought these convicts with him back into the city from which they had been expelled. This form of amnesty used to be explained by many German scholars mostly in terms of the 'sacred kingship' (Sakralkönigtum) as deriving from the charisma of ancient Germanic chieftains or late Roman emperors. They appealed also to the Sachsenspiegel and Schwabespiegel, as if these law books could reveal the basic juridical norms that made it possible for the princes to grant their pardon to exiled criminals. The article argues that the custom had nothing in common either with Roman emperors, ancient chieftains and 'sacred kingship', or with the 'Mirrors'-both these habitual explanations are in fact nothing more than historiographical myths. The author claims that this highly impressive element of royal and princely representation did not even emerge in Germany but was borrowed there only in the late middle ages from an alien royal tradition, and for its roots one should in fact look not to kings but rather to bishops. © The Author 2015.

The paper starts with a puzzle: if ethnic separation is required for peace, how do some partitions that leave minorities behind maintain peace? The paper compares post-partition Georgia–Abkhazia, which experienced violence renewal within five years of the partition, with post-partition Moldova–Transnistria, which maintained peace. Both countries had ‘staybehind’ ethnic minorities. The paper also disaggregates and compares the territories within post-partition Abkhazia, which contain ethnic Georgians: Lower Gali experienced violence while neighboring Upper Gali did not. The paper argues that state institutions create an incentive for ethnic minorities to collaborate with the state, regardless of minority preferences, and this helps maintain peace. However, preferences become important where institutions are weak and members of the ethnic minority have the opportunity to defect, this increases the likelihood of violence. The results build on the ethnic security dilemma by specifying micro-mechanisms and challenging the theory’s reliance on intransigent ethnic identities in explaining the causes of postpartition violence. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941630869

Further, the intensity of cooperation with sister-subsidiaries strongly coincides with the intensity of support from the parent. However, a high intensity of cooperation with sister-subsidiaries was observed for subsidiaries established before 2009.

To date, reasonable practical experience has been accumulated, but there is a lack of a comprehensive conceptual approach for using strategic foresight and roadmapping to solve management problems. Design/methodology/approach – This approach integrates corporate strategic foresight and roadmapping in several stages. During the foresight phase, the authors create scenarios of long-term development determined by long-term macro trends and challenges to identify “points of growth” and system of priorities for company growth. A strategic roadmap enables the company to form a “corridor” for specific projects and create a long-term action plan to implement the priorities identified in the first phase. Using a project roadmap makes it possible to ensure the implementation of a specific project, defining a system of goals, the necessary measures, their timing and financing, as well as indicators to assess their effectiveness. Findings – The core result of the suggested methodology is a set of possible trajectories of innovation development, reflecting the whole technological chain involving R&D – technology – product – market. Each path involves a sequence of organizational actions and key decision-making points that are necessary to be taken to introduce new technological solutions and develop innovation products with new features to the customer/user. These routes support decision-making in such fields as the choice of the product line, establishment of new partnerships with developers of innovation technologies, decisions regarding “insourcing-outsourcing” and the requirements for relevant scientific and technological breakthroughs. It allows corporations to create strategies for commercializing innovation products. Originality/value – The methodology proposes to integrate the results of foresight studies and in roadmaps and finally in business planning, adopting innovative strategies and management decisions. It contributes to the development of common principles and approaches to the subject, while taking account of company-specific features that can significantly affect the decision-making mechanism. The methodology is applicable to foreign and Russian companies when creating innovative strategies and management decisions based on the results of foresight. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate foresight; Innovation; Integrated roadmapping; Strategic foresight; Technology route",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939805112

Design/methodology/approach – Typology construction was chosen as the main study method. Eight polar place demand patterns were classified on the abstract level, using a set of binary variables of spatial behaviour (migration, natural growth and settling). Based on this typology, eight abstract places were deductively described. In conjunction with this deductive study, the authors conducted focus groups, and the results showed considerable similarity in the interpretation of the achieved types. Findings – This paper arrives at interdependent typologies of place demand, place product and place use patterns that allow the ways of using specific places to be identified and distinctive segments and products to be distinguished as particular, consistent combinations of the achieved types. Practical implications – The typologies obtained expand the scope of competitive analysis and planning in framing place marketing. Distinct uses of specific places unambiguously point to the features of certain segments and could thereby enable a lucid marketing strategy. Originality/value – Empirically driven place market research has not precisely defined the distinct ideas and concepts of investigated places, which might reflect the different segments of the population that have different intentions for the use of these places.

Exploring the preparatory stage of the expedition, the author identifies the European and Russian precedents of literary ethnography from Adelbert Chamisso's Reise um die Welt to Ivan Gončarov's Frigate Pallas, which may have provided a model for Konstantin. Extant unpublished documents of the expedition from Russian and Estonian archives allow us to reconstruct its ideological origins and to show that it was born from the spirit of the Russian Geographical Society's projects and the so-called ""nationalizing"" paradigm of ethnographic knowledge that dominated the discursive field in the 1850s. The author demonstrates that the underlying idea of the expedition had much in common with Slavophile ethnography (the case of Ivan Aksakov) and its project of ""Russian science"".

Building on the opposition between the logic of the gift and that of the market, we elucidate moral tensions that call debt relations into being. However, instead of reducing debt to either of these rival principles, we interpret it as a combination of both that allows for mediating between them in a highly ambiguous moral context. Using evidence from a small Russian town, we analyse how interest-free debt functions within face-to-face interactions in local shops and how it structures the ordinary lives of shopkeepers, salespeople and consumers in the community. We discuss a moral situation that turns the framing of everyday purchases into a problem and demonstrate how a material device – a debt book – enters into a transaction in order to resolve it. A debt book turns out to be a specific graphic technology, a destructive device that subverts both marketization and communitarian aid by suspending the framing of interaction. In the resulting atmosphere of ambiguity, debts become an object of strategic manipulation for the members of community that demands good negotiation skills and use of moral arguments. Although the constitution of debt economy is highly dependent on the dynamics of marketization and economization, it can in fact accommodate very different moral regimes. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","debt; framing; gift; market; moral economy; post-socialism",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930818583

To test a gamification effect, an experiment using a volunteer online access panel in Russia was conducted among 1,050 children. The gamified survey produced completion time more than a third longer than the text-only survey. A higher overall item nonresponse rate was found in both the gamified and visual surveys. However, this was mainly due to the Flash-based questions in these conditions. Fewer respondents straight-lined and used middle responses in the gamified and visual surveys. It was also less burdensome to complete the gamified survey. Children requested help to answer survey questions less often. They found it more enjoyable and easier.

The best examples of such imagined gifts were those values and privileges that the Popes allegedly received from Constantine the Great after his conversion to Christianity. The fictitious generosity of Constantine was invented in 'his' famous detailed charter forged in the 8th or 9th century. But other imagined gifts, also having strong legitimizing effect, used to come into being in the same way, due to equally elaborated narratives. As the principality of Moscow was striving for regional dominance in the 15th and 16th cenfuries, a series of influential texts was composed, describing and explaining the gifts of extraordinary political and symbolic relevance, allegedly made either to ancestors of the ruling dynasty, or to predecessors of the highest church dignitaries. The most known among those writings are the anonymous Tale of the Novgorodian White Cowl and the Tale of the princes of Vladimir, as well as the Epistle on the Monomachos Crown by Spiridon-Sawa. These texts claimed that the secular potentates of Moscow, as well as ecclesiastical heads of Novgorod, had been presented in the past with invaluable insignia, either symbolizing the succession to the Roman emperors, or testifying the special benevolence of God. As the author finally argues, the morphology of these imagined gifts was mainly the same as of those in the Donation of Constantine: no really new regalia were created, but the ones already existing were vested with quite new, and nobler, significance, able to ensure a higher level of legitimacy for their possessors. Therefore the ways, how such imagined gifts used to be invented, seem to be substantially identical throughout Europe. © Franz Steiner Verlag GmbH, Stuttgart/Gertnany.",,,"German",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929862265

Two waves of the study were conducted using a volunteer online access panel in Russia among 737 children. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions in the first wave without changing the treatment in the second wave: (1) a text-only survey, (2) a visual survey and (3) a gamified survey. Though in the first wave of the study respondents found it more enjoyable and easier to complete the gamified survey, no differences in participation rates were found between the conditions in the second wave. Contrary to expectations, a higher breakoff was found in the gamified condition. Moreover, it produced lower test-retest reliability correlations than the text-only and visual conditions in all survey questions.

When thinking about the early modern subject as an actor's category, we must distinguish three different meanings: the subject as a bearer of properties, as a reference point for predication, and as the foundation of a discipline. The paper defends the thesis that crucial elements of subjectivity in the modern sense, namely reflexivity and selfawareness, are at the same time characteristic features of a certain understanding of the subject of philosophy as a discipline in the early modern sense: namely for conceptions of philosophy as a transformation of the soul, most notably as a 'medicine of the soul'. Such conceptions are, however, controversial: other early modern thinkers contend that such proposals do not conform to what we should expect from a definition of philosophy and that they are open to the objection of intellectualism: we need more than knowledge to better our souls, because knowledge in itself is not action-guiding. The paper traces conceptions of the subject of philosophy not only in various Ramist tracts, but also in writings of Melanchthon's son-inlaw Heinrich Paxmann, the Helmstedt professor Duncan Liddell, and Reformed thinkers like Fortunatus Crell and Bartholomaeus Keckermann.","Bartholomaeus keckermann; Duncan liddell; Early modern; Fortunatus crell; Germany; Heinrich paxmann; Meta-philosophy; Ramism",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928997392

I analyze the historical development of verbs which are currently labile in modern Russian. The main group of Russian labile verbs includes verbs of motion. On the basis of corpus and dictionary data, I conclude that the behavior of the lexemes under analysis is far from being uniform. However, interestingly, for most of them, e.g., lit' 'flow/pour', gonjat' 'run, drive/chase, pursue', and kružit' 'go round, turn, roll', the proportion of the intransitive use grows throughout the period under analysis, though for the verb kapat'/kapnut' 'drop, pour in drips', in contrast, the transitive use becomes more and more frequent. In the cases when the intransitive use becomes more frequent, the semantic change matches the statistical one. In the beginning, verbs of this subtype were only used intransitively in a restricted type of contexts (e.g., for gonjat' 'run, drive/chase, pursue', hunting contexts represent this restricted class), where the intransitive use might be a result of object omission. Later on, the semantic range of the intransitive use became wider and the lability was no longer semantically related to object omission. I conclude that the emergence of an intransitive use of a strictly transitive verb or the increase of the number of intransitive uses is often accompanied by semantic changes: first, a verb is used intransitively in a very restricted range of contexts (for the verb gonjat' these include hunting contexts). Then, the range of contexts and the semantics of the intransitive use becomes wider, the number of intransitive uses grows and the verb becomes canonically labile with both uses being equally or almost equally frequent. Importantly, the borderline between A- and P-lability is not as strict as it is put sometimes: P-lability (the causative/non-causative alternation) can in some cases be traced back to A-lability (object omission). © 2015 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.","argument; causation; labile verbs; motion verbs; the Russian language; transitivity",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928942803

Previous findings suggested that in agriculture, the barriers for technology adaption are particularly high due to technological conservatism and the atomic structure of the industry. Although RTOs in agriculture publish more and register more patents, they struggle to translate their success into transfer activities. While technology transfer in mining goes well hand in hand with applied research, RTOs in agriculture either build on new technologies or generate revenues through ready-to-use services. The explanation for this rather short-term oriented demand for services of Russia's RTOs lies in the financial situation of client organisations. The vast majority complain about their dire lack of financial means to pay for new technologies. Consequently, agricultural producers do not generate enough revenues to pursue future opportunities, with far reaching consequences. The situation could get better if the RTOs and the client would agree to longer-lasting relationships. © 2015 Imperial College Press.","agriculture; mining; Russia; Technology transfer",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928501155

When discussing these topics, philosophers often resort to certain thought experiments, engaging an important concept that can be broadly identified as ""the global observer."" It relates to Putnam's God's Eye, Davidson's Omniscient Interpreter, and the ultimate observer in quantum physics, among others. Problem: The article explores the notion of the global observer as the guarantor of the determinability and configuration of events in the world. It analyzes the consistency of the notion ""global observer"" from the standpoint of logic and philosophy, and discusses why application of this notion in some contexts poses challenges and appears to be paradoxical. Method: The paper uses conceptual methods of argumentation, such as logical (deduction) and philosophical (phenomenology) kinds of proof. Its key approach is the engagement of thought experiments. Results: The notion of a global observer is incoherent: ""being global"" and ""being an observer"" appear to be incompatible features. It is claimed that from the standpoint of global observation, there are no events occurring in the world. Furthermore, the indefiniteness of the world as a whole is asserted, which is related to the uninformedness of the global observer regarding the ""true state of affairs."" ""Global observation"" turns out to be incompatible with the concept of the observer, blocking, as a result, the opportunity for a determinable configuration of events. It only makes sense to discuss local observations, which are limited to mutual observation or introspections, and not to assume the existence of some absolute truth, reality, or the state of affairs beyond the local observations. Constructivist content: The article emphasizes the role of the observer and observation. It opens up some problematic consequences of the core philosophical assumptions of globally observing existence. Referring to von Foerster's and Luhmann's idea that we can only speak reasonably about local observations, the paper argues that reality is neither external to nor independent of the observer. Implications: The paper could be productive for epistemic theories, theories of quantum physics, and theories of non-classical logic.","Event; Global observer; Ideal observer; Limited observer; Local observer; Omniscient interpreter; Omniscient observer; Truth; Ultimate observer",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924865376

All units were classified according to topic-relation and language sources of stereotypes. The findings showed that the topic-related stereotypes focus on representation of people in three areas – government, business, and realia. As for the linguistic perspective, figurative means are the basic sources for stereotypes, with the emphasis on similes and metaphors of people. Reference sources for figurative means and morphologic means are business-related. Though negative linguistic stereotypes prevail, there are rare positive stereotypes, expressed through syntax. Thus, linguistic stereotypical means help to create the image of Russian business in simplified categories and underlined contrasts: stereotypical lexical units of well-being are combined with characteristics of a poorly-kept country.

In Russia cohabitation has risen sharply in the last decades, but recently its level has stabilized and even decreased slightly. OBJECTIVE We intend to highlight gender and educational differences in perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of cohabitation vs. marriage. METHODS We conducted 8 focus groups in Moscow in January 2012 (4 with men, 4 with women, half with higher educated participants and half with lower educated participants). RESULTS Participants claimed that trust between men and women underlies preferences for marriage or cohabitation. Participants? religious beliefs form a 'three stages of union' theory: cohabitation in the beginning, civil marriage later when trust has developed, and finally a church wedding when trust is established. In union formation the participants? ideals are the values of responsibility, freedom, fidelity, and trust. The level of trust is highest for proponents of marriage and ideational cohabitors. People without a strong preference for a certain type of union have the lowest level of interpersonal trust. CONCLUSIONS In a society that currently can be considered anomic, interpersonal trust was found to be the most important factor underlying expressed ideals in choice of union type. It takes different forms for adherents of marriage (""trust with closed eyes"") and adherents of cohabitation (""trust with open eyes""). © 2015 Olga Isupova.",,,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922650148

This study deals with an analysis of the M&A strategy utilized by Unilever Group, as well as with issues relating to identifying the factors defining the value of a diversified company. To these ends, there are particular methods that can be applied to Unilever Group. Because the structure of this diversified company is rather complex, it makes sense to determine whether the company has been accurately valued by the market (if it is overvalued/undervalued), as well as to define the way the market responds to M&A transactions effected by this company. This study includes an estimation of the effectiveness of Unilever Group's mergers and acquisitions strategy, aimed at creating the optimum business portfolio within the diversified corporate structure (company) by how it affects value of the company. The general hypothesis assumes that diversification does not have a destructive effect on the value of an international multi-business company that builds its portfolio based on the success of certain brands and business areas. © Medwell Journals, 2015.","Company value; Diversified company; Expected rate of return on invested capital; Merger and acquisition transactions; Strategy effectiveness",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84914141588

The self-determination theory in its expanded version turned out to be more efficient while studying the students' motivation. It suggests a more detailed typology of motivation, provides more differentiated explanations of causes encouraging students for a more active involvement into the study process. Additionally, it suggests a system of internal motivation resources based on three identified needs: autonomy, competency and relatedness. The theory advantage is that it enables the explanation of the dynamics of various types of encouraging motives: situational, contextual and global.

Analysis of syntactic and morphosyntactic properties of these two subclasses shows that items traditionally labeled as inflected postpositions form a homogeneous group and show noun-like behavior in most cases, while non-inflected postpositions are heterogeneous. Based on this analysis, we propose to single out a part-of-speech class of relational nouns and show that the rest of the postpositions could be further divided into subclasses with different behavior.

Inclusion is formed in the professional activity within specific organizations and, in a wider context, in the course of reform of social policy, with the change of values and needs of the population. At the organizational level inclusion is presented in three aspects: official measures, professional practice, and culture manifested in the interactions of the participants of an inclusive process, their relationship, shared values and attitudes. It is shown that an inclusive culture becomes embedded within an organization when all professionals share the values of respect for human rights and diversity, participation, mutual learning and dialogue with clients. Based on materials from interviews with social work specialists, inclusion of migrants is studied in the context of professional organizational culture.

Changing political circumstances, including the Tsars' orders concerning the representation of the Russian Empire's past and nationbuilding projects propagated by Russian elites constituted key variables. Between 1812 and 1914, preachers, artists, journalists, rulers, military officers, authors of memoirs, civil and military historians, writers and journalists participated in a dispute over the 'heroes' and 'villains' of the 1812 war. The present study draws on sources from the 19th and early 20th century such as the history of Aleksandr Michailovskii Danilevskii, the memoirs of Aleksei Er-molov, Nadezhda Durova and Denis Davydov, lyrics by Vasilii Zhukovskii, and Lev Tolstoi's novel War and Peace. It compares and contrasts these author's statements and ideas with the visual, poetic, journalistic and commemorative imagery of their time. Such an approach helps explain how heroic characters were designed and demonstrates the ambivalence of their positions: the frequently cyclical dynamic of appearance and disappearance from mainstream narratives of Russian history. This approach also allows for the attribution of individual narratives to specific discursive genres. Genetic source criticism was applied when analyzing War and Peace. Tolstoi's drafts and notes are examined to reveal the ways in which his concept of the novel changed over time, including gradual revisions in the shaping of characters and the use of the memories of war veterans to create a grand narrative. All this allows for an identification of the techniques Tolstoi applied when working with historical evidence, his recoding of the cultural and psychological profiles of certain characters, his retouching of contradictory elements, and his omission of a vast number of facts. The authors conclude that the heroization techniques applied in these narratives strongly depended upon the philosophy of history of their time. Thus, in the 1820-30's the trend towards romanticizing and nationalizing the Russian past manifested itself in a desacralization of Emperor Alexander I and a substitution of the idea of a ""people's war"" for that of a ""holy war"". By contrast, Lev Tolstoi's national project meant that the writer depersonalized war and heroized the Russian family and the Russian people. Later on, this discourse was reinforced through the sociologization of the writing of history, which meant that historians presented the war of 1812 as a clash of abstract interests, processes, and groups, to which the names of heroes served as accessories. © Franz Steiner Verlag GmbH, Stuttgart/Germany.",,,"German",Review,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962577064

The prevalence of childlessness in Russia is estimated on the basis of the 2002 and 2010 National Census data. The third wave of the Russian Generation and Gender Survey (GGS-Russia, 2011) and the second wave of the Moscow and its Citizens Survey (MaCS, 2013) form the basis for childlessness determinants modeling. The study demonstrates the existence of relatively broad childlessness in Russia and proves its recent growth from low to middle range. The prevalence of eventual childlessness as well as of zero child preferences appears to be significantly higher in Moscow compared to the rest of the country. In the capital city childless intentions are widespread among 40-49-year-old well-educated and well-paid individuals who are the only children in the parental family and who do not consider official marriage or having children to be prerequisites for happiness. With regard to the rest of the country, only higher age, biological infertility and absence of a partner are significant determinants of zero child preferences. Thus, in Moscow, apart from involuntary or circumstantial childlessness we may be capturing the first sprouts of voluntary childlessness, while in the rest of the country we observe only the first two types of behavior. © 2015.

These properties are crucial in many application areas, e.g. workflow modeling, embedded systems design, and bioinformatics. This paper deals with the problem of transforming a given live, but unbounded Petri net into a live and bounded one by adding time constraints.

In particular, the authors note that, at least until the present, the Russian Constitutional Court has chosen to abstain from crafting principles of legal policy regarding religious issues. Furthermore, in religious cases, the Russian judiciary - by and large - does not follow the jurisprudence of the ecthr, and the Russian Supreme Court has no clear-cut policy in handling these cases. In such a situation, ordinary judges choose individual strategies. These are indispensable insomuch as fidelity to the letter of the law is inadequate for adjudicating such cases.

In the literature the idea of a permanent methodological crisis in psychology, lasting since the 1890s, dominates. We contest this view and argue that the contemporary methodological problems in psychology should be considered within the context of the novel and larger crisis challenging all socio-humanitarian knowledge in the face of the transformations in social reality in recent decades. The nature of these transformations and their implications for the theory and methodology of the socio-humanitarian sciences are analyzed by drawing on the sociological literature, which is more sensitive to changes in social life than is psychology. Prominent sociologists argue that the ""old"" theories and interpretations of the ""social"" are no longer relevant in the new, highly complex, and globally unstable reality; this new reality has largely transformed the dimensions of human beings' existence. Meanwhile psychology still tends to comprehend the universal nature of the human. This position undermines the relevance of both psychology's theoretical models and the practical implications derived from these methodological assumptions. We argue for revision of the perennial psychological problem of the biology-culture interaction in human nature. To resolve the contemporary methodological crisis in psychology, a shift is needed from theories of universal and immutable human nature to the idea of the human as an infinitely changing creature. Because culture is, primarily, the ability to change, wherein the speed and extent of changes are unique for humans, distinguishing them from other living beings.","Biosocial problem; Crisis in sociology; General crisis of socio-humanitarian sciences; Human nature; Methodological crisis; Social reality; Social transformations",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954424149

The European Commission often refers in its merger or antitrust decisions to the products (or services) of brand X that enter into competition on a relevant market with the products (or services) of brand Y. The term brand used in this context aims to provide a factual observation on the operation of the specific relevant market. No further inferences are made. Inquiring into the role of brands in this context is a simple exercise and offers little to the research question explored in this volume. However, the issue becomes more complex if one engages with the use of brands as an operational concept in EU competition law. Operational concepts connect theoretical concepts to simple factual observations. For instance, the operational concept of ‘market power’ connects a fact concerning the level of prices in a specific market at a certain point in time, which is partially an observable fact, with the theoretical construction of price theory, for instance the theoretical concept of monopoly or its antithesis, that of perfect competition, from which market power is a departure. These operational concepts help decision-makers to make inferences (they serve as analytical shortcuts) about the relation between the different facts they observe in order to assess causal relations and make predictions. It is now accepted that competition law makes extensive use of operational concepts transplanted from the discipline of economics, in particular neoclassical price theory. Yet its receptivity to operational concepts developed in other disciplines, management studies in particular, has been relatively limited. And here lies the core of the problem with regard to the engagement of EU competition law with the concept of ‘brands’. Although the discipline of economics and in particular neoclassical price theory perceives brands as a fact of economic life, until recently price theory has not made use of the term as an operational concept. Instead, economists prefer to focus on the semi-operational concepts of product differentiation, advertising or that of barriers to entry, which describe the consequences of the existence of brands, but do not engage directly with the concept of brand. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954245173

Despite the collapse of socialist agricultural system, when rural communities existed under patronage of collective farms, substantial part of the privately owned post-Soviet farms still donate to rural municipalities and population. The article is based on the fieldwork conducted in Altai Krai in 2013 when qualitative data (informal interviews, group discussions, observations) were collected by the author and his colleagues. Gift-giving relations between agricultural producers and municipalities could be described as ""natural"" bottom-up pattern. We perceive these Soviet-style gift-giving relations as the way to mitigate the weaknesses both of the Russian state rural policy as well as market self-regulation mechanism.

In computational linguistics, some attempts have been made to obtain verb classes for English, German and other languages using observable morpho-syntactic and lexical properties of context (Dorr and Jones 1996; Lapata 1999; Schulte im Walde 2006; Lenci 2014, among others). Our experiments on semantic classification of Russian verbs are based on two types of tags embedded in the annotation of argument constructions: A) semantic roles and b) morpho-syntactic patterns. The domain of speech verbs is classified automatically on vectors, and the resulting clusters are contrasted against Babenko (2007)'s semantic classes and three other manual classifications. The classes within the domain of possessive verbs are constructed using rule-based solutions and evaluated against Berkeley FrameNet verb clusters.

The paper states that compound disyllabic words under a phrase accent have both syllables stressed, stress being signalized by mid [o] // [e] vowels impossible in unstressed position in Standard Modern Russian. In non-compound native words unstressed [o] vowel in all types of phrase positions after ""hard"" consonants is displaced by [a] (unstressed [a] being about 10 percent longer than stressed [o]). Our data shows that in compound disyllabic words in a position with no tonal accent phonetically unstressed /o/ is realized by reduced [] (not standard [a]) vowel (being somewhat twice shorter than unstressed [a]). Thus, non-trivial [o] vowel reduction in compounds may serve as a phonetic cue of phonological stress which is shown up fully only under the tonal accent.

In the political discourse, there was near dominance of a linear, kind of “vectorial” perception of global political trends: from the breakdown of various forms of autocracy to liberal democracy and market economy. It was as if, with the collapse of Communism, only one universal political goal and one anticipated political end result of global dynamic remained on the agenda – liberal democracy and free market economy. There seemed to be only one dominant political trajectory of democratization that should be pursued by all nations of the world: Karl Marx “upside down,” or Communist Manifesto per contra: all nations sooner or later will become liberal democracies – some earlier, others later. The world was perceived as flexible and “plastic” – you can “craft” (not “breed”!) democracy (Di Palma 1991) as you know “the” proper institutional design and can master appropriate political engineering. Democracy was perceived as a universal value and model with a specific invariant (though maybe not the concrete form) that would fit all nations despite all their differences in history, culture, levels of development, and so on (Sen 1999). However, twenty years since then, the world looks very different. As if after a global political “big bang,” we can see and experience an incredible multiplicity of political trajectories – kinds of “receding political galaxies” rushing in all possible directions and defying traditional regime typologies. Hopes or illusions about one single, uniform vector of global political development – from authoritarianism to democracy – are practically forgotten. There is much talk nowadays about the “democratic rollback” (Diamond 2008a), “authoritarian diffusion” (Ambrosio 2010), “democratic stagnation,” “postdemocracy” (Crouch 2003), threats of degeneration into ochlocracy, and “audience democracy” (Manin 1997).

This paper introduces a novel technique, highly normalized Big Data using Anchor modeling, that provides a very efficient way to store information and utilize resources, thereby providing ad-hoc querying with high performance for the first time in massively parallel processing databases.

Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on a literature review, the study determines management challenges by implementation of organizational learning in the Russian business context. Taking this into account, the authors suggest specific model of organizational learning which contains organizational learning processes, organizational culture oriented towards learning and transformational leadership. Empirical justification of this model is provided using a sample of more than 100 respondents. Partial least squares-analysis is applied to define structural relationships between the elements of proposed model. Findings – The study reveals the positive and significant influence of transformational leadership and an organizational culture on organizational learning processes. Moreover, transformational leadership is shown to have a positive impact on an organizational culture, confirming the hypothesis regarding the pivotal role of leaders in the Russian business context. Research limitations/implications – The findings of this study can assist managers doing business in Russia to improve organizational learning processes.

Design/methodology/approach – The sample includes 85 Russian equity funds for the period of 2013. First, Jensen’s alpha for each fund has been calculated, and then cross-sectional regression analysis has been used. While only a part of fund managers publish biographic sketches, the authors use the Heckman procedure to control for self-selection issues. Findings – The results support the idea that the individual characteristics indicate the possibility to earn abnormal alpha. Managers with economic education and with Moscow education perform better than others. Relationship between both fund performance measures and manager’s experience has inverted U-shape. Jensen’s alpha reaches its highest level at the point of 9 years, whereas beta – at 10 years of manager’s experience. Research limitations/implications – Investigation can be improved by including more variables that influence the disclosure of managers’ personal information, for example, by conducting surveys. Additionally, cross-sectional data restrict the analysis. Practical implications – The discovered characteristics of managers’ intellectual capital can be used as additional screening tool for the investor who is deciding on mutual fund choice in Russia. While individual intellectual capital is observable and more persistent in time in comparison with the past fund performance, such tool allows better decision-making.

Design/methodology/approach – The study is carried out in three steps. The first stage comes to identify the coordinates of intangibles in which strategic profiles are found. The second stage enables a clusterization of more than 1,600 European companies observed during seven years in the coordinates of intangibles. The last step introduces comparative analysis of these clusters in terms of their performance. Findings – As a result of empirical analysis three strategic profiles regarding intangibles are discovered. Two of these profiles are called intangible-intensive as they demonstrate clear predominance of a particular set of intangibles. The innovative profile is associated with intensive investment in innovation and networking capabilities. The conservative profile puts emphasis on managerial capabilities and development of business process. The non-intangible-intensive profile, that has been called moderate, evenly allocates resources among intangibles keeping them on a low level relative to the intangible-intensive profiles. Practical implications – This research is useful for practitioners in strategic and knowledge management. It provides insight into common features of company strategies for intangibles as well their impact on short- and long-term performance. Originality/value – This work contributes to the field of strategic knowledge management by demonstrating a new relevant typology in company behavior regarding intangibles. Moreover, it equips decision makers in companies with a tool to design strategic vision in intangibles. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cluster; Intangible-intensive strategy; Intangibles; Strategic profile",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942913126

Psychology, both as science and practice, has been largely developed in one cultural area of the world: Europe and North America. As a result, the discipline is culture-bound, limited in its origins, concepts, and empirical findings to only this small portion of the world. The discipline is also cultureblind, largely ignoring the influence of the role of culture in shaping the development and display of human behaviour. These limitations have resulted in the dominant position of a Western Academic Scientific Psychology (WASP) in relation to other cultural perspectives on human behaviour. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach? This paper draws on concepts and strategies in psychology (particularly cross-cultural and intercultural psychology) to propose some remedies to problems arising from the dominant WASP position. For example, of what relevance is such a limited perspective to understanding human activity in other cultures; and how can such a limited understanding serve the purpose of effective intercultural interactions? Findings? The eventual goal is to achieve a global psychology that incorporates concepts and findings from societies and cultures from all parts of the world, one that will permit a valid understanding of people within their cultures, and permit effective intercultural across cultures. Originality/value? The paper presents some criticisms of the dominant western psychology (WASP), and proposes that the achievement of a more global psychology may be within reach if some concepts and methods now available in psychology from both the dominant western sources and from those working in the rest of the world are used. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Acculturation; Acculturation strategies; Cross-cultural psychology; Culture-blind; Culture-bound; Dominance; Global psychology; Indigenous psychology; Intercultural psychology; Prevention strategies; Universalism",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937910325

Such general suffix trees have many applications and are for example needed to allow efficient updates when suffix trees are built online. We prove that τ is a suffix tree if and only if it is realized by a string S of length n − 1, and we give a linear-time algorithm for inferring S when the first letter on each edge is known.

Process discovery is the most prominent process-mining task: A process model is derived based on an event log. The process model should be able to capture causalities, choices, concurrency, and loops. Process discovery is very challenging because of trade-offs between fitness, simplicity, precision, and generalization. Note that event logs typically only hold example behavior and cannot be assumed to be complete (to avoid over fitting). Dozens of process discovery techniques have been proposed. These use a wide range of approaches, e.g., language- or state-based regions, genetic mining, heuristics, expectation maximization, iterative log-splitting, etc. When models or logs become too large for analysis, the event log may be automatically decomposed or traces may be clustered before discovery. Clustering and decomposition are done automatically, i.e., no additional information is used. This paper proposes a different approach where a localized event log is assumed. Events are localized by assigning a nonempty set of regions to each event. It is assumed that regions can only interact through shared events. Consider for example the mining of software systems. The events recorded typically explicitly refer to parts of the system (components, services, etc.). Currently, such information is ignored during discovery. However, references to system parts may be used to localize events. Also in other application domains, it is possible to localize events, e.g., communication events in an organization may refer to multiple departments (that may be seen as regions). This paper proposes a generic process discovery approach based on localized event logs. The approach has been implemented in ProM and experimental results show that location information indeed helps to improve the quality of the discovered models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Data mining; Economic and social effects; Iterative methods; Maximum principle; Expectation - maximizations; Generic process; Localized events; Location information; Process Discovery; Process mining; Process Modeling; Software systems; Petri nets","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937468868

Findings - For Russian elite researchers participating in academic mobility, in 2000s it is rather cross-border mobility' brain circulation' rather than ""brain drain"" a dominant form of academic mobility typical. Even in 2000s, western foundations still played a significant while twofold role -promoting emigration of for a small part of Russian elite researchers, on the one hand, while and getting access to top-level labs, etc. and to international academic chains of excellence for the majority of them, on the other.

The analysis finds support for the hypothesis and also explores the relationship between gossip and gender autonomy.

The concept of entangled relational spaces is the main analytical tool of this article. Seeking to overcome identity-based essentialisms, the article deconstructs gender identity and demonstrates how it can be articulated and interpreted in different relational spaces. It extends the argument that oppressions are produced by various social categories (intersectionality) by adding that a single social category may beget various forms of oppression and that heterogeneous gender asymmetries are produced and manifested across different relational spaces. Evidence deriving from predominantly indigenous sources authored by women enabled the discussion of gendered power asymmetries in economic, legal, and political spaces produced by corresponding relations. Economic and demographic crises, which the indigenous peoples of Siberia endured in the 1910s–1920s, reduced gendered power asymmetries in economic spaces making women less dependent on men. On women's initiative the shifts then spread to legal spaces and, with the support of the Bolshevik government, affected political spaces. These shifts were closely connected to the early Soviet attempts at dialog with indigenous people, decolonizing Siberia and liberating indigenous women, and gave way to instrumental policies. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","asymmetry; indigenous peoples; relational spaces; Siberia; USSR",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930573989

This is mainly due to increasing awareness among politicians, academics and the wider population on the importance of environmental aspects in daily life. Consequently demand for environmentally friendly solutions is expected to grow continuously in the next decade. The present study is part of a broader research project which examines the long-term science and technology (S&T) agenda in Russia up to 2030. The project's results were approved by the Prime Minister of Russia in early January 2014. Researchers from the National Research University Higher School of Economics carried out the research project at the request of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science between 2011 and 2013. The research comprised six interrelated spheres: ICT; biotechnology, medicine and public health; new materials and nanotechnologies; environmental management; transport and space systems; and energy efficiency and energy conservation. For each sphere, the project explored in-depth the global emergent challenges and opportunities, the risks, and their degree of influence on Russia. The authors analysed the most important potential market niches, products and services that are capable of radically shaping world markets and highlighted their competitive advantages. Within the framework of these priority science areas authors emphasised several spheres of particular potential value and compared the level of research carried out in Russia and the leading countries. The current paper also covers the analyses of the natural resources sector made within a project aimed at integration of national and sectoral S&T Foresight studies funded by the Russian Ministry of Education and Science. Findings show that the potential applications for environmental products and services are manifold. The study is based on a thorough analysis of expert opinions and their assessment of future applications and the development of demand for these applications. However the authors note that the expert opinions included in the assessment of prospective products, services and markets, despite being based on rigorous assessment, still reflect expectations. Their opinions incorporate a degree of uncertainty especially with regard to how and when (or whether) the markets, technologies, products and services will develop in the expected ways.

Discussions presented focus on recent technological developments and their impacts on society with three plausible future scenarios; the energy agenda with new technological advancements and future energy partnerships; and the dynamics of Russia’s future development agenda amid the Ukraine crisis. Design/methodology/approach - The paper includes a commentary on the SPIEF 2014 Forum. Ideas presented are extended through the review of relevant references and future scenarios. Findings - Technological development will continue to shape societies and may even result with the transformation of social classes. Energy will remain as a top priority area on the global and regional socio-economic agenda, with political implications across the world and in Russia. Research limitations/implications - A number of research questions arose through the discussion on the relationships between science, technology and society; future energy technologies; and geo-politics. Social implications - Technological development will certainly have implications on society. The paper explores those impacts through “visionary”, “negative” and “different” scenarios. Similarly, the transformations in the energy sector will have broader social and environmental impacts.

However, the further development of Russia's position in the European gas market is still unclear. The basic question is whether Russia will go for spot pricing or will it still provide all price reviews within the framework of oil indexation? Analyses of the European gas market supply-demand balance show that pricing policy changes could be expected by the end of this decade, when new suppliers reach the European market and the next wave of gas glut might occur.

Given an unlabeled tree τ on n nodes and suffix links of its internal nodes, we ask the question ""Is τ a suffix tree?"", i.e., is there a string S whose suffix tree has the same topological structure as τ? We place no restrictions on S, in particular we do not require that S ends with a unique symbol. This corresponds to considering the more general definition of implicit or extended suffix trees. Such general suffix trees have many applications and are for example needed to allow efficient updates when suffix trees are built online. Deciding if τ is a suffix tree is not an easy task, because, with no restrictions on the final symbol, we cannot guess the length of a string that realizes τ from the number of leaves. And without an upper bound on the length of such a string, it is not even clear how to solve the problem by an exhaustive search. In this paper, we prove that τ is a suffix tree if and only if it is realized by a string S of length n-1, and we give a linear-time algorithm for inferring S when the first letter on each edge is known.

For example, event logs can be used to automatically learn a process model (e.g., a Petri net or BPMN model). Next to the automated discovery of the real underlying process, there are process mining techniques to analyze bottlenecks, to uncover hidden inefficiencies, to check compliance, to explain deviations, to predict performance, and to guide users towards “better” processes. Dozens (if not hundreds) of process mining techniques are available and their value has been proven in many case studies. However, existing techniques focus on the analysis of a single process rather than the comparison of different processes. In this paper, we propose comparative process mining using process cubes. An event has attributes referring to the dimensions of the process cube. Through slicing, dicing, rolling-up, and drilling-down we can view event data from different angles and produce process mining results that can be compared. To illustrate the process cube concept, we focus on educational data. In particular, we analyze data of students watching video lectures given by the first author. The dimensions of the process cube allow us to compare the process of students that passed the course versus the process of students that failed. We can also analyze differences between male and female students, between different parts of the course, and between Dutch students and international students.

We apply quantile regression to model the association between school characteristics and gender differences in test scores throughout the distribution of test scores. Male advantage in test scores, particularly at the top of the distribution, is concentrated in cities and in the schools with an advanced curriculum. In other high schools, especially in the countryside, gender differences in all parts of the distribution are small. We suggest several mechanisms based on selection and school effects that account for our findings. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","gender gap in mathematics; quantile regression; Russia; school effects",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922255115

The programme aims to address taboos, stigma, discrimination, HIV/AIDS prevention and the promotion of sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and a healthy lifestyle among adolescents. The programme uses an “edutainment” model that involves young people through music, dance and youth icons. Educated volunteers provide schoolchildren with comprehensive information on SRHR and demonstrate the practical application of life and leadership skills. The programme ends with a celebration event.Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Only those who got as far as stage three of the process, 20 per cent of those who begun, were sampled. The qualitative research involved youth aged 13-19 (20 interviews, six focus groups), teachers (eight interviews), volunteer team members (eight interviews) and programme managers in four project regions and in Moscow (five interviews). In the quantitative research 105 respondents took part, of whom 48 per cent were 13-16 years old, 44 per cent were 17-19 years old and 8 per cent were 20-23 years old. Both boys and girls were included in the sample.Findings – Young people’s participation in D4L had a significant positive impact on perceptions of SRHR and knowledge levels, changed some misconceptions about HIV/AIDS and helped develop social and healthy lifestyle skills. The programme contributed to the growth of voluntary activity and the organizational skills of participants. Teachers’ perceptions of SRHR changed positively after their participation in the programme.Research limitations/implications – The fact that the sample is only those who completed all stages of the programme, 20 per cent of the overall population who began it, is clearly a source of bias. The size of the quantitative research sample (n=105) does not allow disaggregation of data by region nor by gender: this limitation was minimized by choosing four regions with relatively comparable socio-economic status, and through quota sampling in equal proportions for boys and girls. This is the first time such a study has been conducted, so it is not possible to draw conclusions about the long-term impact of the programme.Practical implications – The short implementation period allows for the dissemination of information and training to large numbers despite limited funding.Social implications – The D4L approach provides information on SRHR to youth, which arouses their interest, and is perceived as relevant and important. Programme participants use this information themselves and share it with their friends, parents and other adults.Originality/value – The D4L programme is unique in Russia: there is no regular sexual education in Russian schools.

The blow-forming tests were carried out at the temperature of 415 °C using aluminum alloy (AMg-6) sheets of a 0.92 mm thickness. Each test was performed at constant pressure. For each fixed value of pressure, a series of experiments was carried out with different forming times to obtain evolutions of dome height H and thickness s. Two different constitutive equations were used to describe the dependence of flow stress on the effective strain rate: the Backofen power equation and the Smirnov one taking into account an s-shape of stress-strain rate curve in the logarithmic scale. The constants of these equations were obtained by least squares minimization of deviations between the experimental variations of H and s and ones predicted by a simplified engineering model formulated for this purpose. Using the Smirnov constitutive model to describe the dependence of flow stress on strain rate, unlike the classical power law, makes it possible to analyze the variation of strain rate sensitivity index m with strain rate. On the basis of the obtained data, the optimum strain rate for AMg-6 processing was estimated as one corresponding to the maximum of strain rate sensitivity index. The validity of the proposed method was examined by finite element simulation of free bulging process. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

SUNUT' is usually considered as one of ""putting verbs"" (denoting change of location), but it has some peculiarities in its syntax, derivational patterns, semantics and stylistics. Unlike other verbs of this taxonomic class, SUNUT' profiles the way the object is transferred to the final location, but not the location itself. It implies that after the object is rapidly moved by the human hand, the hand is quickly removed from the final location of the object. The idea of incompleteness which arises due to the component of high speed is responsible for lowregister uses of SUNUT'. It is shown that the component of low register disappears in the context of some prefixes, like PRO-, which change the semantic profile of the lexical item. However, ZA-or POD-derivatives inherit the original stylistic register of SUNUT' and enrich it with additional implicatures emerged from their meaning ('putting far away'-> 'without enough control' + low register; 'putting under'-> 'secretly' + low register). Low register is also inherited by two reflexive derivatives of SUNUT': SUNUT'SIA ('to tamper') and SOVAT'SIA ('to horn in'). The results of the corpus study (based on the data of Russian National Corpus, www.ruscorpora.ru) presented in the paper demonstrate that previously the reflexive and nonreflexive forms of SUNUT' were not stylistically marked and occurred in neutral surroundings. No earlier than in the 19th century the reflexive forms SUNUT'SIA and SOVAT'SIA denoted impatient motion of a human being in different directions. In most cases that was motion forward form the initial position. Interestingly, the forms were also used in contexts of polite request, which proves they were not marked stylistically. The gradual effect of lowering of the register took place within the interval of one century; it represents a clear case of a semantic shift affecting these derivatives. The non-reflexive verb SUNUT' displays an unusual semantic development: along with 'putting', in Modern Russian, it can denote 'giving', 'showing' and 'hitting'. The final part of the paper argues that the corresponding shifts (no matter how unusual they look) are motivated by regular syntactic patterns of SUNUT'. The most complicated is the shift from 'putting' to 'hitting'. The verb undergoes radical syntactic reinterpretation and becomes intransitive. However, the mechanism of this shift is fully transparent as it is shown in the article.","Derivational patterns; Lexical semantics; Prefixes; Russian language; Semantic motivation; Stylistics; Verbs of putting",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055982531

A typical example of such a general Boolean domain, for the purpose of our results, is {1,2}n. We are mainly interested in the length (the number of monomials) of PTFs, with their degree and weight being of secondary interest. First we motivate the study of PTFs over the {1,2}n domain by showing their close relation to depth two threshold circuits. In particular we show that PTFs of polynomial length and polynomial degree compute exactly the functions computed by polynomial size THR ○ MAJ circuits. We note that known lower bounds for THR ○ MAJ circuits extend to the likely strictly stronger model of PTFs (with no degree restriction). We also show that a ""max-plus"" version of PTFs is related to AC0 ○ THR circuits. We exploit this connection to gain a better understanding of threshold circuits. In particular, we show that (super-logarithmic) lower bounds for 3-player randomized communication protocols with unbounded error would yield (super-polynomial) size lower bounds for THR ○ THR circuits. Finally, having thus motivated the model, we initiate structural studies of PTFs.

In this respect most interesting proved to be his views on hypothetical logics, especially from the point of view of his slogan ‘Pay attention to things not words’. Galen thinks that there are three ways in which a pair of states of affairs might be related: they might be in conflict, in consequence, or in neither relation. This Galen’s classification of relations between states of affairs might be represented in form of a specific ontological square. Traces of Galen’s conceptions are trailing in modern logic particularly in the systems of non-fregean and relevant logics having situational semantics. Thus, in the framework of non-fregean logic from “Q situationally involves P” follows “if P then Q” (but not vice versa) which meets Galen’s slogan. Rather different, more complicated situational semantics of relevant logic also displays the signs of Galen’s logical attitude. Such semantics allows to take into account the closeness of relevant implication to the natural language conditionals while in Galen’s reasoning we most often deal namely with conditionals which best of all describe the situations occurred during the disease diagnostics by virtue of its hypothetical nature. To some extent semantics of such conditional descriptions would be employed in computer medical diagnostics. In this case the modern physician inevitably should be a logician like he was in Galen’s time. © Vladimir L.

The actors implementing the internal effects minimize costs and receive benefits. If there are side effects (externalities), the other actors who had not participated directly in the internal effects implementation can obtain advantages and profits without bearing any costs. Externalities affect actors' motivations and encourage them to perform (or failure) some functions of the national innovation system (NIS). In order to achieve a rational combination of conflicting functions, it is necessary to reach certain proportions between the effects of actors' activities and the emerging externalities of these activities. The externalities and their impact on NIS processes are considered from the standpoint of a country passing a particular stage of technological development. The effectiveness of NIS actors' operations in the processes of knowledge transfer strongly depends on integration of national markets into global ones. The key mechanism of such integration is international competition. The positive externalities of international competition can create motivation for domestic actors of the NIS to innovate. However, if the competition is too intensive, it may lead to irreversible consequences for the domestic industries. At the same time, classic protectionism and high barriers to entry for foreign companies into domestic markets preserves the backward technological structure and thus serves as the main obstacles to economic development. The models of technology diffusion are considered to determine the possible ways of balancing positive and negative externalities of international competition on the investment stage of country's development. Much of the attention of the study focuses on such an externality as a technological spillover. On the investment stage, excessive suppression of technological spillover restricts entries of new domestic participants into markets and reduces their ability to further development of new products or production methods. The paper take into account the problem of choosing a degree of regulation of technological spillover and finding a balance between strict and lax protection of intellectual property rights. The examples of solving this problem for some countries are given. Finally, externalities of the bias in favour of a particular type of innovations are considered. These are the expansion of busyness research capacity and active business partnership and cooperation with external sources of R&D. So as to remove unfavorable structural changes caused by these externalities, there is a need to achieve some balance between positive and negative their influences.","Business bias and preferences; Externalities; Innovation policy; International competition; Product and process innovations; Technological spillover","Commerce; Competition; Innovation; Intellectual property; International trade; Investments; Knowledge management; Laws and legislation; Motivation; Rational functions; Externalities; Innovation policies; International competitions; Process Innovation; Technological spillovers; Economics","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994127989

On the basis of statistics for 2008-2012 years, 63 indicators of human potential for all directions are selected. In the final result, the correlation analysis has led to the substantiation of the system of indicators consisting of 10 indicators. Three economic and seven social indicators characterizing human potential are included into this system. On the basis of the indicators by means of hierarchical agglomerative methods of cluster analysis, a classification of the Russian regions is carried out in two versions: with economic indicators and without them.

After reviewing the key ideas and schools of urban and urbanization studies, the authors examine the conceptual diversity and many-sided nature of deurbanization as a spatial, societal and cultural-mental transformation. The controversial discourse of the latter, which often implies opposite approaches and phenomena, such as social lifting or downshifting, is stressed, along with the greater role of individual decisions. Stronger social and spatial links between cities and rural areas in the globalizing world manifest themselves in the accelerated formation of the rural-urban continuum and through the growing recurrent spatial mobility of people. Russia's incomplete urbanization and polarization of its socio-economic space have created two massive opposite flows, i.e. the centrifugal seasonal dacha deurbanization and the centripetal labor migration of Russian villagers and small town dwellers towards large cities. The two streams are interrelated, e.g. temporal urban work, and the lodging of Russian otkhodniks instead of resettling, leading to the prolongation of the life of peripheral localities where their families stay. This habitability, in turn, facilitates the dacha development of small settlements. The article considers the reasons for ""guest work"" in Russian cities and the variety of dachas, as well as their impact on both urban and rural lifestyles. Mass movements of vacationers and workers and their two-house lives, sometimes balanced in time, complicates the knowledge of how many people actually live and work in the countryside, in small and big cities. This is a serious obstacle to the adequate maintenance and development of Russia's spaces, since local budgets are designed for permanent population alone - which in many places is partially true. © 2015 r.","Deurbanization; Downshifting; Labor migration; Otkhodniks; Rural-urban continuum; Seasonal dacha deurbanization; Spatial mobility; Urbanization",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962578245

Therefore there is a greater need for improved forecasting methods that take into account the dynamics of market factors, primarily those related to the use of new technologies. We analyse the difficulties of forecasting demand for liquid fuels in conditions of uncertainty related to future technological developments in car transport. We classify the technologies driving demand for motor fuels by the nature of their impact on the demand for petroleum products: technologies aimed at improving the energy efficiency of traditional cars, as well as drivers of inter-fuel competition, both in terms of direct and indirect substitutes for petroleum products. To resolve the problem of limited input information, the methodology incorporates clustering instruments, which enable us to group countries according to certain criteria. The use of economic and mathematical tools with optimizing units enables us to make integrated calculations that model the market for liquid fuels and assess its interactions with the markets of other energy resources. Our proposed system for forecasting demand for liquid fuels, including petroleum products, can be used as an instrument to assess the future impact of technological innovation on the development of the oil industry when carrying out Foresight studies.","Alternative fuel; Automotive transport; Energy efficiency; Forecast of demand; Oil products; Technology",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953310163

Circumfical verbs are analyzed as involving the following steps of derivation. First, the activity event structure projected by a non-derived stem is augmented by the change-of-state component that turns it into an accomplishment even structure. Secondly, prefixation occurs that introduces the maximal degree of change along a relevant scale creating a transitive verb. Such a verb, however, is ill-formed since the changeof-state component has not been licensed via lexical insertion. To rescue the derivation, reflexivization is invoked, and the change-of-state subevent gets licensed through identification of its participant with the clausal subject. A wider theoretical implication of the analysis is that circumfixation, as a primitive type of affixation, is superfluous and is to be abandoned.","Accomplishments; Activities; Circumfixation; Derivational morphology; Event structure",,"Russian",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952778042

The approach is based on the numerical decomposition of the free energy profiles of the transmembrane (TM) helices into components corresponding to protein-protein, protein-lipid, and protein-water interactions. The method was tested for the TM segments of human glycophorin A (GpA) and two mutant forms, Gly83Ala and Thr87Val. It was shown that lipids make a significant negative contribution to the free energy of dimerization, while amino acid residues forming the interface of the helix-helix contact may be unfavorable in terms of free energy. The detailed balance between different energy contributions is highly dependent on the amino acid sequence of the TM protein segment. The results show the dominant role of the environment in the interaction of membrane proteins that is changing our notion of the driving force behind the spontaneous association of TM α-helices.

Construct a complex torus by glueing the two boundary components of the annulus{ z Є ℂ/ℤ | 0 &lt; Im(z) &lt; Im(ω) } via the map f+ω.

We show that the Diophantine and non tangential assumptions are unnecessary: If rot(f+ω0) is irrational, then τ tends to rot (f+ω0) as ω tends to ω0. This, together with results of N. Goncharuk [4], motivates us to introduce a new fractal set (``bubbles'') given by the limit values of \tau as \omega tends to the real axis.

The gains (or their absence), in the Saeb test, for the 1999-2013 period, are also higher in mathematics than in Portuguese. Part of the gains in the Pisa math test and most of those in the reading test result from the gradual increase in the number of years fifteen year-old students spend in school.

This is consistent with the presence of geographical poverty traps: potential migrants want to leave the poor regions but cannot afford to move.

In communities with a high share of votes for the Green and the Leftist party in the federal state elections, the percent of favorable votes for the Olympic bid was significantly lower. Moreover, the negative effect of the number of hotel beds per capita suggests that voters were concerned with crowding-out of regular tourists during the Olympics.

We summarize catch data on 20 species and species groups of fishes and lamprey, as well as available abiotic data (salinity, temperature and water transparency). Water transparency gradually decreased during the 20th century being inseparable from a number of non-quantified anthropogenic factors, thus it can be used as an integral index of anthropogenic loading on the ecosystem. Because fisheries statistics were not published regularly, catch data were extracted from archives and various publications. Fishing locations, gear and target species changed over time in relation to each other, reflecting technological developments in fisheries, commercial demands for fishery products and the abundance of fish populations. Until the 18–19th centuries, fisheries took place mostly in rivers where weirs and set nets targeted sturgeon, salmon and whitefish. By the end of the 19th century, herring and smelt were the main targets of fixed nets in coastal areas. A century later, the main commercial species, herring, was harvested with pelagic trawls operating offshore in the Gulf. This evolution in fisheries, along with other anthropogenic activities, caused severe declines in diadromous species. Spawning migrations that make them easy to catch, and their high market value, make diadromous fish more vulnerable than other groups. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that catches of most diadromous species decreased with increasing transparency, which may reflect their response to anthropogenic pressure. Marine and freshwater fish suffered from anthropogenic pressure, but to a lesser extent probably because of a wider distribution and dispersal, and more capital-intensive fishing methods. Catches of marine species, except herring, significantly increased in the 1970–1980s when salinity was comparatively high. We found no correlation of fish catches with temperature. © 2014, Springer Basel.","Baltic Sea; Gulf of Finland; Historical ecology; History of fisheries","abiotic factor; abundance; anthropogenic effect; canonical analysis; catch statistics; commercial activity; fish; fishing gear; historical ecology; market conditions; migration; spatiotemporal analysis; spawning; technological development; trawling; trend analysis; twentieth century; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Baltic Sea; Gulf of Finland; Leningrad; Neva River; Russian Federation; Clupeidae; Petromyzontidae; Pisces","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937976136

Both cities were subject to similar housing and urban policy during Soviet times, and they have implemented urban development using neoliberal market principles, provoking grassroots opposition from citizens to privatisation and marketisation of their housing environment and local public space. However, the differing conditions of democratic Lithuanian and authoritarian Russian public governance offer different opportunities and set different constraints for neighbourhood mobilisation. The purpose is to contrast local community mobilisations under the two regimes and highlight the differences between and similarities in the activists' repertoires of actions in two distinct political and economic urban settings. Design/methodology/approach - The paper employs qualitative methodology using data from semi-structured interviews conducted with community activists and state officials, presented using a comparative case study design. Findings - Although, citizens' mobilisations in the two cities are reactions to the neoliberalisation of housing and local public space, they take different forms. In Vilnius they are institutionalised and receive formal support from national and local authorities. Moreover, support from the EU encourages organisational development and provides material and cognitive resources for grassroots urban mobilisations. In contrast, residents' mobilisations in Moscow are informal and face fierce opposition from local authorities. However, even in an authoritarian setting, grassroots mobilisations evolve using creative strategies to circumvent institutional constraints. Originality/value - Little attention has been paid to grassroots urban mobilisations in post-Soviet cities. There is also a lack of comparative attempts to show variation in post-Soviet urban activism related to housing and local public space. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Grassroots; Housing policy; Mobilizations; Moscow; Public space; Vilnius paper type research paper",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937706243

Second, out-group trust emerges independent from in-group trust when human empowerment emancipates people from in-group control.

However, relatively little is known about what greed is and does. This article reports on 5 studies that develop and test the 7-item Dispositional Greed Scale (DGS). Study 1 (including 4 separate samples from 2 different countries, total N = 6092) provides evidence for the construct and discriminant validity of the DGS in terms of positive correlations with maximization, self-interest, envy, materialism, and impulsiveness, and negative correlations with self-control and life satisfaction. Study 2 (N = 290) presents further evidence for discriminant validity, finding that the DGS predicts greedy behavioral tendencies over and above materialism. Furthermore, the DGS predicts economic behavior: greedy people allocate more money to themselves in dictator games (Study 3, N = 300) and ultimatum games (Study 4, N = 603), and take more in a resource dilemma (Study 5, N = 305). These findings shed light on what greed is and does, how people differ in greed, and how greed can be measured. In addition, they show the importance of greed in economic behavior and provide directions for future studies. © 2015 American Psychological Association.","Economic behavior; Experimental games; Greed; Individual differences","adult; female; human; individuality; male; middle aged; personality; personality test; satisfaction; self control; social behavior; video game; young adult; Adult; Female; Humans; Individuality; Male; Middle Aged; Personal Satisfaction; Personality; Personality Tests; Self-Control; Social Behavior; Video Games; Young Adult","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929511239

Despite these general trends, there are significant regional differences in YURs and above-average YUR regions tend to cluster close to each other. Moreover, a distinction between ""North"" and ""South"" regions seems appropriate for both countries. The purpose of this study is to identify key determinants of YURs in the Russian and Italian regions, for the period 2000-2009. We also search for the existence of distance spatial effects. In particular, we estimate a modified Arellano-Bond model for the regional YUR, including some explanatory and control variables (e.g. regional GDP in PPP, regional population density, regional total unemployment rate), together with year dummies and North/South dummies. The use of distance matrixes enables important analysis to be conducted on the role played by spatial effects, which turn out to be significant. Also the negative impact of the 2008-2009 crisis is statistically confirmed (at least in the case of Italy).

This technique allows to monitor charge trapping in gate dielectric of MIS structures under high-field and another stress situations (irradiation, plasma, hot carriers, etc.). The technique also may be used for testing thin gate dielectric defects. Unlike simple techniques, for example constant current stress and J-ramp current stress, the proposed method uses a sequence of stress current and measuring current pulses. At the same time, the processes of charging and discharging of the MIS structure capacitance as well as the charge trapping in the gate dielectric are taken into account. Charging of MIS structure from inversion to accumulation modes or back way allows one to retrieve a low frequency capacitive-voltage characteristic. Account charging capacitance of MIS structure and charge trapping in gate dielectric at injective mode lets considerably increase metrological characteristics of this technique and reduce inaccuracies.

In fact, however, democracy might logically be expected to be especially responsive only to the people's desires, not their needs. Responses to people's objective needs can be substantially different from responses to their subjective desires. Democratic institutions therefore cannot guarantee (and may even hamper) responsiveness to basic human needs.

The MIS structures have been studied using novel techniques of multilevel current stress.

The ITT provides structural modification of SiO2 and Si-SiO2 interfaces. It has been shown that the ITT at elevated temperatures can reduce the reliability of MIS devices.

In this paper, the nature and underlying reason for these significant deviations from expected behavior are considered. Understanding these differences in financial market behavior is important for a wide range of reasons, including: assessing investments, investor relations, decisions to raise capital, assessment of firm and management performance. We show that using a “thicker tailed” mixture of two normal distributions offers a significantly more accurate model than the traditionally Gaussian approach in describing the behavior of the value of oil and gas firms. This mixture of normal distribution is also more effective in bridging the gap between management theory and practice without the need to introduce complex time-sensitive GARCH and/or jump diffusion dynamics. The mixture distribution is consistent with ambidexterity theory that suggests firms operate in two distinct states driven by the primary focus of the firm: an exploration state with high uncertainty and, an exploitation (or production) state with lower uncertainty. The findings have direct implications on improving the accuracy of real option pricing techniques and futures analysis of risk management. Traditional options pricing models assume that commercial returns from these assets are described by a normal random walk. However, a normal random walk model discounts the possibility of large changes to the marketplace from events such as the discovery of important reserves or the introduction of new technology. The mixture distribution proves to be well suited to inherently describe the unusually large risks and opportunities associated with oil and gas production and exploration. A significance testing study of 554 oil and gas exploration and production firms empirically supports using a mixture distribution grounded in ambidexterity theory to describe the value fluctuations for these firms.

Next, we find the leading term of asymptotics of the implied volatility in the case where the asset prices follow the multidimensional Black-Scholes model with time change by an independent increasing stochastic process. Finally, we deal with a general situation in which the dependence between the assets is described by a given copula function.

Apart from conventional clustering techniques, biclustering is searching for homogeneous groups of objects while keeping their common description, e.g., in binary setting, their shared attributes. In bioinformatics, biclustering is used to find genes, which are active in a subset of situations, thus being candidates for biomarkers. However, the authors of those biclustering techniques that are popular in gene expression analysis, may overlook the existing methods. For instance, BiMax algorithm is aimed at finding biclusters, which are well-known for decades as formal concepts. Moreover, even if bioinformatics classify the biclustering methods according to reasonable domain-driven criteria, their classification taxonomies may be different from survey to survey and not full as well. So, in this paper we propose to use concept lattices as a tool for taxonomy building (in the biclustering domain) and attribute exploration as means for cross-domain taxonomy completion.

Their functioning determines the response of the cell to the external conditions. Also, they provide cellular communication and recognitionmechanisms. So, their proper functioning is a vital question of life. There is a lot of data today about these receptors. Many three-dimensional (3D) structures are known, genetic causes of some diseases are determined andmany therapeutic agents acting on the membrane proteins are developed. But today with all this knowledge we cannot exactly predict the effects of new mutations in these proteins on their activity and cannot decipher the mechanisms of their action in detail. On the other side, cell membrane consists of phospholipids acting as a matrix for the proteins and other molecules like glycolipids. Of course, exact lipid composition of the membrane affects the proteins behavior, but this phenomenon is reversible. Many papers describe how single-point mutations act on the protein activity, another large area of study includes determination of the influence from the lipid bilayer properties. But little is said about how the protein itself induces local perturbations on the membrane. Taking this into account, we decided to examine the simplest case of the membrane protein with a help of atomistic computer simulations of molecular dynamics. Using transmembrane (TM) helical peptide representing TMdomain of human glycophorinA in hydrated lipid bilayer, we showed that it can induce local perturbations of lipid properties, and the characteristic size of the pattern is 10-15 ÅA. So, the peptides can feel each other on large distances (about 20 Å), and this estimation is confirmed by calculation of the association free energy. We determined that the interaction interface for dimer formation also serves as a binding site for lipids. They are removed from this site during dimerization process, but stay nearby in the dimer structure filling the gaps next to the contact of helices. We assume that native sequences generate specific distributions of lipids around them to find each other in the membrane and have specific surface relief to strengthen the interaction in case of dimerizing proteins by lipid binding to the formed dimer. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We demonstrate that at sufficiently high heating rates (higher than 10 5 - 10 6 K/s) the temperatures 500-1000 K above the graphite melting temperature can be reached before the crystal decay.

Frequency is an anti-monotonic function, i.e., given an infrequent pattern, all its superpatterns are not frequent. However, many other constraints for pattern selection are not (anti-)monotonic, which makes it difficult to generate patterns satisfying these constraints.

The potential for heterosexual spread has not been analysed. Methods: A sample of PWID was accrued using two methods. A questionnaire was administered to assess HIV-related risk behaviours for parenteral and sexual transmission, sociodemographic factors, HIV knowledge and attitudes about sexual risks. Data were analysed focusing on the role of imprisonment, factors associated with awareness of being HIV infected and condom use. Results: More than a quarter of the sample reported having been diagnosed with HIV infection, with higher prevalence among women and those with a history of incarceration. More than half reported having been diagnosed with hepatitis C virus infection. Those reporting being HIV positive were less likely to distribute used syringes to other PWID and more likely to have used a condom the last time they had sex. A history of incarceration was associated with higher rates of receptive syringe sharing among those not having ever received an HIV-positive diagnosis and a lower likelihood of believing that condoms are needed when having sex with a casual partner. Conclusion: Although extensive HIV testing has alerted many PWID to their HIV-positive status, which is associated with less distributive syringe sharing and higher likelihood of condom use, substantial risk for parenteral and especially sexual HIV transmission remains.

Methods: Trends in mortality, alcohol production and sales were analyzed in conjunction with alcohol control legislative measures. Correlation analysis of health and alcohol market indicators was performed. Results: Ethyl alcohol production was the strongest correlate of alcohol-related mortality, which is probably due to the fact that ethyl alcohol is used for both recorded and unrecorded alcohol production. Measures producing greatest mortality reduction effect included provisions which reduced ethyl alcohol production (introduction of minimum authorized capital for ethyl alcohol and liquor producers in 2006 and the requirement for distillery dreg processing), as well as measures to tax and denaturize ethanol-containing liquids in 2006. Liquor tax decrease in real terms was associated with rising mortality in 1998-1999, while excise tax increasewas associated with mortality reduction in 2004 and since 2012. Conventional alcohol control measures may also have played a moderately positive role. Conclusions: Countries with high alcohol-related mortality should aim for a reduction in spirits consumption as a major health policy. Alcohol market centralization and reduction of the number of producers can have immediate strong effects on mortality. These measures should be combined with an increase in alcohol taxes and prices, as well as other established alcohol policy measures. In 2015 in Russia, this is not being implemented. In Russia, legislation enforcement including excise tax collection remains the major challenge. Another challenge will be the integration into the Eurasian Economic Union. © The Author 2015.

In the realm of neuropsychology, research has investigated the inter-dependence of language and thought by testing individuals with compromised language abilities and observing whether performance in other cognitive domains is diminished. One group of such individuals is patients with aphasia who have an impairment in speech and language arising from a brain injury, such as a stroke. Our previous research has shown that the degree of language impairment in these individuals is strongly associated with the degree of impairment on complex reasoning tasks, such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) and Raven's Matrices. In the current study, we present new data from a large group of individuals with aphasia that show a dissociation in performance between putatively non-verbal tasks on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) that require differing degrees of reasoning (Picture Completion vs. Picture Arrangement tasks). We also present an update and replication of our previous findings with the WCST showing that individuals with the most profound core language deficits (i.e., impaired comprehension and disordered language output) are particularly impaired on problem-solving tasks. In the second part of the paper, we present findings from a neurologically intact individual known as ""Chelsea"" who was not exposed to language due to an unaddressed hearing loss that was present since birth. At the age of 32, she was fitted with hearing aids and exposed to spoken and signed language for the first time, but she was only able to acquire a limited language capacity. Chelsea was tested on a series of standardized neuropsychological measures, including reasoning and problem-solving tasks. She was able to perform well on a number of visuospatial tasks but was disproportionately impaired on tasks that required reasoning, such as Raven's Matrices and the WAIS Picture Arrangement task. Together, these findings suggest that language supports complex reasoning, possibly due to the facilitative role of verbal working memory and inner speech in higher mental processes. © 2015 Baldo, Paulraj, Curran and Dronkers.","Aphasia; Deafness; Inner speech; Language; Language delay; Problem-solving; Reasoning; Thought",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947244858

It explores the summits’ performance, the division of labour during their coexistence, their comparative strengths and limitations, and how the future partnership could be improved to benefit the global community. The authors explain the recent evolution and performance of the G8 and G20 summits and their evolving empirical relationship. They consider the G8/G20 relationship with other actors engaged in global governance, notably the major multilateral organizations and civil society. They assess G7/8 and G20 effectiveness and accountability. And they identify, based on this empirical and analytical foundation, how the relationship can be improved for today’s tightly wired world. © Marina Larionova and John J. Kirton 2015.

Performance measuring governance in terms of the modern state is centres on establishing the contentment of the customers purchasing these goods. This means the public servants need special professional skills for this aim: A personal performance management based on professional growth and focused on the main mission of the government–social support in mind of fulfilling civil clients’ needs. We would like to identify the degree of personal support for this conception. The research was carried out in December 2014 in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Russia. In regard to sampling procedure, we utilised a quota sampling with a representative age and gender distribution. We selected 303 participants, all of whom in the position of public servants of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The research method adopted was a questionnaire; data processing was carried out using SPSS. The results of the research show that public servants are still guided by old skills and requirements. Moreover, they are dedicated to the classical and old-fashioned conception of rational bureaucracy, based on M. Weber’s principles, namely administrative efficiency, power hierarchy, formally established and clearly documented system of rules, and impersonal activity and emotional neutrality relations. Thus, most public servants consider their main goal as governance (28.2%). They describe their job as the performance of the state (42%), administration (17%) and execution of orders (17%). However, staff at the age of 30 years (35%) more frequently chooses the satisfaction of client needs and the delivery of public goods as the main goals of authorities. This gives us hope that, in the next 5 years, the professional skills of public servants will change in line with new requirements if the educational policy remains the same. © 2015, Econjournals.

The GFE research programme has demonstrated the utility of applying the concept of ‘anomia’ – an individual reaction to disruptions in the normative order – to explain prejudices against vulnerable groups. This paper extends the GFE research programme by incorporating insights from Institutional Anomie Theory, a theoretical perspective originally introduced in the criminological literature. Drawing upon this, it develops a theoretical model that links perceptions of weakened non-economic institutions with prejudices against groups that are readily seen as being ‘unprofitable’. These perceptions are theorized to affect prejudices against such groups via a pathway of ‘marketized’ attitudes and orientations, net of any influence of anomia. This paper’s theoretical model was assessed with data from a representative survey of the German population (n = 840). The results of Structural Equation Modelling support most of the main hypotheses, revealing the additional value for prejudice research of measuring the individual experience of anomie not only as anomia but also with respect to processes of marketization. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Anomie; Germany; marketization; prejudices; Structural Equation Modelling",,"English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939237933

Given a string of length n over an alphabet of size ω ≤ n, our method builds the wavelet tree in O(n log ω √log n) time, improving upon the state-of-the-art algorithm by a factor of √log n. As a consequence, given an array of n integers we can construct in O(n√log n) time a data structure consisting of O(n) machine words and capable of answering rank/select queries for the subranges of the array in O(log n/log log n) time. This is a log log n-factor improvement in query time compared to Chan and Pətraşcu (SODA 2010) and a √log n-factor improvement in construction time compared to Brodal et al. (Theor. Comput. Sci. 2011). Next, we switch to stringological context and propose a novel notion of wavelet suffix trees. For a string w of length n, this data structure occupies O(n) words, takes O (n√log n) time to construct, and simultaneously captures the combinatorial structure of substrings of w while enabling efficient top-down traversal and binary search. In particular, with a wavelet suffix tree we are able to answer in O(log |x|) time the following two natural analogues of rank/select queries for suffixes of substrings: 1) For substrings x and y of w (given by their endpoints) count the number of suffixes of x that are lexicographically smaller than y; 2) For a substring x of w (given by its endpoints) and an integer fc, find the κ-th lexicographically smallest suffix of x. We further show that wavelet suffix trees allow to compute a run-length-encoded Burrows-Wheeler transform of a substring x of w (again, given by its endpoints) in O(slog|x|) time, where s denotes the length of the resulting run-length encoding. This answers a question by Cormode and Muthukrishnan (SODA 2005), who considered an analogous problem for Lempel-Ziv compression. All our algorithms, except for the construction of wavelet suffix trees, which additionally requires O(n) time in expectation, are deterministic and operate in the word RAM model.

The submanifold is a covering of a submanifold in the dual space to the Grothendieck group, and the affine braid group acts by deck transformations. We also propose a new variant of definition of stabilities on a triangulated category, which we call a “real variation of stability conditions” and discuss its relation to Bridgeland’s definition.

When the closed subscheme is a Cartier divisor, we consider matrix factorizations of the related section of a line bundle, and their analogues with locally free sheaves replaced by coherent ones. The appropriate exotic derived category of coherent matrix factorizations is then identified with the triangulated category of relative singularities, while the similar exotic derived category of locally free matrix factorizations is its full subcategory. The latter category is identified with the kernel of the direct image functor corresponding to the closed embedding of the zero locus and acting between the conventional (absolute) triangulated categories of singularities. Similar results are obtained for matrix factorizations of infinite rank; and two different “large” versions of the triangulated category of relative singularities, corresponding to the approaches of Orlov and Krause, are identified in the case of a Cartier divisor. A version of the Thomason-Trobaugh-Neeman localization theorem is proven for coherent matrix factorizations and disproven for locally free matrix factorizations of finite rank. Contravariant (coherent) and covariant (quasicoherent) versions of the Serre-Grothendieck duality theorems for matrix factorizations are established, and pull-backs and push-forwards of matrix factorizations are discussed at length.

This study explores the associations between Internet access at home and well-being, as well as other lifestyle variables. Design/methodology/approach: The study was done in a probability sample of 800 community-dwelling adults aged 16 and over in six most deprived areas of the Redbridge borough of London. Using face-to-face interviews, information on the demographics, lifestyle, Internet access at home, happiness, trait hope, and subjective health was obtained. Path analysis and structural equation modelling were used to investigate the associations between Internet access and well-being, controlling for demographic variables. Findings: Respondents with home Internet access had stronger social ties with friends and relatives, engaged in a wider repertoire of community creative activities and cultural events, and reported having higher social support. Controlling for demographic variables, Internet access at home was a weak but statistically significant predictor of happiness, agency, and absence of mental health problems. The effect of home Internet access on happiness was partially mediated by social ties. Research limitations/implications: The correlational nature of the study forbids making causal inferences. The data suggest that people with low socioeconomic status may derive wellbeing benefits from having access to information technology which can serve as an instrument for social integration.

Often, this is achieved by computing a correlation between behavioral measures, e.g., reaction times, and neurophysiological recordings, e.g., prestimulus EEG alpha-power, on a single-trial-basis. This approach treats individual trials as independent measurements and ignores the fact that data are acquired in a temporal order. It has already been shown that behavioral measures as well as neurophysiological recordings display power-law dynamics, which implies that trials are not in fact independent. Critically, computing the correlation coefficient between two measures exhibiting long-range temporal dependencies may introduce spurious correlations, thus leading to erroneous conclusions about the relationship between brain activity and behavioral measures. Here, we address data-analytic pitfalls which may arise when long-range temporal dependencies in neural as well as behavioral measures are ignored. We quantify the influence of temporal dependencies of neural and behavioral measures on the observed correlations through simulations. Results are further supported in analysis of real EEG data recorded in a simple reaction time task, where the aim is to predict the latency of responses on the basis of prestimulus alpha oscillations. We show that it is possible to ""predict"" reaction times from one subject on the basis of EEG activity recorded in another subject simply owing to the fact that both measures display power-law dynamics. The same is true when correlating EEG activity obtained from different subjects. A surrogate-data procedure is described which correctly tests for the presence of correlation while controlling for the effect of power-law dynamics.

However, based on the varying fundamental features of these two aphasia syndromes, the potentially different underlying mechanisms of impairment and scant preliminary evidence of varying cognitive deficits, a differential relationship between cognitive function and language processing in these two groups can be predicted. Aims: The current study investigates the hypothesis concerning the differential impact of cognitive impairments in individuals with fluent versus non-fluent aphasia types. Methods & Procedures: Participants with fluent (n = 19) and non-fluent (n = 16) aphasia and participants without brain damage (n = 36) were presented with an eye-tracking WM task. Additionally, individuals with aphasia completed two language comprehension tasks. Outcomes & Results: Results revealed significant decrease in WM capacity in individuals with aphasia compared with participants without brain damage. The two aphasia groups performed similarly on the WM and language tasks. Furthermore, for participants with non-fluent aphasia, it was revealed that WM makes a significant contribution to language comprehension, while for fluent individuals this relationship was not significant. Conclusions: Overall, the present data support the claim that there are cognitive deficits in aphasia and that these cognitive deficits tend to exacerbate the language impairments of persons with non-fluent aphasia types. The results are discussed in the context of varying mechanisms of impairment in different types of aphasia. The present findings have important implications both for the assessment and the treatment of individuals with aphasia and for understanding the nature of aphasia. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","fluent aphasia; language comprehension; non-fluent aphasia; working memory","adult; aged; aphasia; Article; cognitive defect; comprehension; controlled study; disease severity; eye movement; female; human; human experiment; language processing; major clinical study; male; pattern recognition; progressive nonfluent aphasia; scoring system; speech and language assessment; stimulus response; task performance; verbal behavior; visual stimulation; working memory","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928694798

Traditionally a two-step procedure is used. The first step is a transition from sensor to source space by the means of solving an ill-posed inverse problem for each subject individually. The second is mapping of cortical regions consis- tently active across subjects. In practice the first step often leads to a set of active cortical regions whose location and timecourses display a great amount of interindividual variability hindering the subsequent group analysis. We propose Group Analysis Leads to Accuracy (GALA) - a solution that combines the two steps into one. GALA takes advantage of individual variations of cortical geometry and sensor locations. It exploits the ensuing variability in electromagnetic forward model as a source of additional information. We assume that for different subjects functionally identical cortical regions are located in close proximity and partially overlap and their timecourses are correlated. This relaxed similarity constraint on the inverse solution can be expressed within a probabilistic framework, allowing for an iterative algorithm solving the inverse problem jointly for all subjects. A systematic simulation study showed that GALA, as compared with the standard min-norm approach, improves accuracy of true activity recovery, when accuracy is assessed both in terms of spatial proximity of the estimated and true activations and correct specification of spatial extent of the activated regions. This improvement obtained without using any noise normalization techniques for both solutions, preserved for a wide range of between-subject variations in both spatial and temporal features of regional activation. The correspond- ing activation timecourses exhibit significantly higher similarity across subjects. Similar results were obtained for a real MEG dataset of face-specific evoked responses. © 2015 Kozunov and Ossadtchi.","Covariance model; Group analysis; Inverse problem; Iterations; Maximum likelihood; MEG; Rank of leadfield matrix","algorithm; Article; brain cortex; brain region; electromagnetic field; exploratory research; fusiform face area; group analysis lead to accuracy; human; intermethod comparison; kernel method; magnetoencephalography; occipital cortex; simulation; spatial analysis; statistical analysis; statistical model; time series analysis","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928167921

However, the acculturation expectations have received relatively less attention from researchers, and support for multiculturalism has rarely been examined from the perspective of immigrants. The present study used the framework of the Mutual Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies (MIRIPS) project to investigate the acculturation experiences and intercultural relations in Hong Kong by incorporating mutual views of both the dominant and non-dominant groups. It also tested the mediating role of the dominant group's tolerance towards different cultural groups and the non-dominant group's perceived discrimination. Two community samples were recruited, including Hong Kong residents (N=181) and immigrants from Mainland China (N=182). Among Mainland immigrants, the integration strategy predicted both psychological adaptation and sociocultural adaptation. Multicultural ideology predicted psychological adaptation and played a significant role in intercultural contact with Hong Kong people through the mediation of lower perceived discrimination. Among Hong Kong residents, the integration expectation predicted psychological adaptation. Multicultural ideology indirectly affected intercultural contact with Mainland immigrants through the mediation of greater tolerance. These results suggest that the integration strategy and expectation are more important to intrapersonal functioning, whereas multicultural ideology may be more crucial in facilitating social interactions between members of the society of settlement and immigrants in culturally plural milieus.

Among them, there exist the so-called discrete TBCs whose advantages are the complete absence of spurious reflections, reliable computational stability, clear mathematical background and the corresponding rigorous stability theory. In this paper, the Strang-type splitting with respect to the potential is applied to three two-level schemes with different discretizations in space having the approximation order O(τ2+ |h|k), k D 2 or 4.

Two specific types of noises are studied in detail: a non-Gaussian Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and a time-varying linear combination of a Brownian motion and compound Poisson process. We develop new analytical tools to treat the adaptive estimation problems from discrete data. A lower bound for the frequency sampling, needed for the efficiency of the procedure constructed by discrete observations, has been found. Sharp non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for the robust quadratic risk have been derived. New convergence rates for the efficient procedures have been obtained. An example of the regression with a martingale noise exhibits that the minimax robust convergence rate may be both higher or lower as compared with the minimax rate for the ""white noise"" model.

The topological trigger selects vertices which are a) detached from the primary proton-proton collision and b) compatible with coming from the decay of a b-hadron. In the LHC Run 1, this trigger, which utilized a custom boosted decision tree algorithm, selected a nearly 100% pure sample of b-hadrons with a typical efficiency of 60-70%; its output was used in about 60% of LHCb papers. This talk presents studies carried out to optimize the topological trigger for LHC Run 2. In particular, we have carried out a detailed comparison of various machine learning classifier algorithms, e.g., AdaBoost, MatrixNet and neural networks. The topological trigger algorithm is designed to select all 'interesting"" decays of b-hadrons, but cannot be trained on every such decay. Studies have therefore been performed to determine how to optimize the performance of the classification algorithm on decays not used in the training. Methods studied include cascading, ensembling and blending techniques.

They tend to believe that Russia is prone to producing unique forms of political organization. Many Russians feel flattered and readily accept their exceptionalism. Does this mentally exaggerated uniqueness of Russia have any actual affirmation? Any country in fact has a peculiar constitution of its body politic and national psyche as well as a history of its own. Many are so irregular from a common perspective that they may rightfully claim uniqueness. Russia may be a proper example of being very uncommon. But even actual inimitability cannot deprive a country of essential properties of its kind. Thus, any polity would have a power structure, albeit a very peculiar one. Any state would have individual members, be they citizens or subjects, or qualify to any other uncommon criteria of membership. With all it exceptional appearance, Russia is a constituent of the global community of states, in many ways a fairly sound and reliable one. At present, members of this community resort to polar models of relations between people and state authorities. One implies one-way subordination of people to authority, another interaction between them including accountability of authorities. Of course, in any polity, one can find institutions and practices of subordination as well as institutions and practices of interaction and accountability. The question is, Which are dominant and shape political order? The ones where subordination still prevails are less modern and more autocratic. The ones where interaction and accountability already have an advantage are more modern and democratic. In many cases, we can see uneasy processes of subordination being gradually reduced and supplanted by accountability coming to the fore. © Adam Przeworski 2015.",,,"English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952673886

Although simple to implement and potentially useful to augment many functions, such myoelectric devices still need improvement before they become practical. Here we considered the problem of reconstruction of handwriting from multichannel EMG activity. Previously, linear regression methods (e.g., the Wiener filter) have been utilized for this purpose with some success. To improve reconstruction accuracy, we implemented the Kalman filter, which allows to fuse two information sources: the physical characteristics of handwriting and the activity of the leading hand muscles, registered by the EMG. Applying the Kalman filter, we were able to convert eight channels of EMG activity recorded from the forearm and the hand muscles into smooth reconstructions of handwritten traces. The filter operates in a causal manner and acts as a true predictor utilizing the EMGs from the past only, which makes the approach suitable for real-time operations. Our algorithm is appropriate for clinical neuroprosthetic applications and computer peripherals. Moreover, it is applicable to a broader class of tasks where predictive myoelectric control is needed. © 2015 Okorokova, Lebedev, Linderman and Ossadtchi.","Dynamical modeling; Electromyography; Handwriting; Pattern recognition; The Kalman Filter; The Wiener Filter","algorithm; Article; biomechanics; comparative study; controlled study; electrode implantation; electromyography; handwriting; human; human experiment; Kalman Filter; mathematical analysis; muscle contraction; neuromuscular function; normal human; statistical model; task performance; Wiener Filter","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946573858

A typical solution is generating only a part of all patterns satisfying some criteria. The most well-known criterion is support of a pattern, which has the monotonicity property allowing one to generate only frequent (highly supported) patterns. Many other useful criteria are not monotonic, which makes it difficult to generate best patterns efficiently. In this paper we introduce the notion of ""generalized monotonicity"" and algorithm that allow to generate top patterns in polynomial time modulo basic operations, e.g., measure computation, for criteria that are not monotonic. This approach is applicable not only to itemsets, but to complex descriptions such as sequences, graphs, numbers or interval tuples, etc. In this paper we consider stability and A-measures which are not monotonic.

In particular, GRACE temporal gravity field observations revolutionize the study of basin-scale hydrology, because gravity data reflect mass changes related to ground and surface water redistribution, ice melting, and precipitation accumulation over large scales. However, to use the GRACE data products, de-striping/filtering is required. We applied the multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) technique to filter GRACE data and separate its principal components (PCs) at different periodicities. Data averaging over the 15 largest river basins of Russia was performed. Spring 2013 can be characterized by the extremely large snow accumulation occurred in Russia. Melting of this snow induced large floods and abrupt increase of river levels. The exceptional maxima are evident from GRACE observations, which can be compared to the hydrological models, such as Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) or WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM), and gauge data. Long-periodic climate-related changes were separated into PC 2. Finally, it was observed that there were mass increases in Siberia and decreases around the Caspian Sea. Overall trend over Russia demonstrates mass increase until 2009, when it had a maximum, followed by the decrease. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.","Earth’s gravity field; GRACE; Hydrological changes; MSSA","Earth (planet); Geodetic satellites; Hydrology; Microcomputers; Principal component analysis; Rivers; Snow; Spectrum analysis; Watersheds; GRACE; Gravity field; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Hydrological changes; Land data assimilation systems; MSSA; Multichannel singular spectrum analysis; Spherical harmonic coefficient; Gravitation","English",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943408750

All types of cell stress are accompanied by the activation of anti-stress genes that can suppress ROS synthesis. We hypothesized that different environmental factors would affect organisms through the activation of anti-stress genes by autologous serum (AS) proteins, followed by the synthesis of molecules that increase cell resistance to oxidative stress. The goal of this work was to study the influence of AS on ROS production by peripheral blood neutrophils isolated from donors in different age groups. Neutrophils were isolated from 59 donors (38-94 years old). AS was heated at 100°C for 30 s. or irradiated by UV light at 200-280 nm and 8 W for 10 min. Neutrophils were exposed to heat shock at 42°C for 1 min. (short-term heating stress) or 43°C for 10 min., followed by the determination of the chemiluminescence reaction induced by zymosan. AS can increase or decrease ROS production by neutrophils depending on the structure of the proteins in the serum; these structures can be changed by heating or UV treatment and the temperature of their interaction (4 or 37°C). We propose that the effect of environmental factors on AS proteins can cause an adverse increase in oxidative stress levels due to the functional reduction of anti-stress genes. We found a negative correlation between the quantity of intracellular Hsp70 and levels of intracellular ROS production following 10 min of heat shock at 43°C. Short-term heating stress (1 min) at 42°C was followed by a prominent reduction in ROS production. This effect may be a result of the impact of the hormone adrenaline on the functions of anti-stress genes. Indeed, the same effect was observed after treatment of the neutrophils with adrenaline at concentrations of 10-4 and 10-5 M. In contrast, dexamethasone from the other stress hormone group did not evoke the same effect at the same concentrations. © 2015 Semenkov, Michalski and Sapozhnikov.","Adrenaline; Autologous proteins; Dexamethasone; Heat shock proteins; Phagocytosis; Reactive oxygen species; Short-term heating stress; Ultraviolet light","adrenalin; dexamethasone; heat shock protein 70; reactive oxygen metabolite; adult; aged; Article; chemoluminescence; controlled study; female; flow cytometry; gene function; heat shock; heating; human; human cell; male; neutrophil; oxidative stress; phagocyte; serum; ultraviolet radiation; very elderly","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940103763

According to the syntactic-oriented strategy, while processing the questions like Kto devochku potseloval v shkole? (who-NOM girl-ACC kissed at school?), activation of the object referent devochka at the verb would signal a post-verbal trace of wh-movement. Alternatively, if the processing is context-dependent, the overt object devochka preceding the verb precludes the possibility that it could be the referent of the whfiller, and the reactivation of the subject NP referent should follow instead. Indeed, the results show that the proportion of fixations on the object NP referent at the verb was less than on the subject NP referent. Therefore identification of the referent associated with the wh-filler is not syntactically constrained, but instead is contextually fed: as soon as the context provides enough cues to exclude referents that cannot be linked to the wh-filler, the remaining referent gets associated with it.","Eye-tracking; Syntactic trace; Wh-questions",,"Russian",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937713035

An efficient algorithm to use such information is provided and the effect of those inequalities on the reconstruction quality is studied. © 2015 SPIE.","computed tomography; metal artifacts; photon starvation; tomographic reconstruction","Algorithms; Computer vision; Constraint theory; Medical applications; Photons; Tomography; Inequality constraint; Linear inequalities; Metal artifact reduction; Metal artifacts; Reconstruction quality; Tomographic; Tomographic reconstruction; Computerized tomography","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958206150

The other SAGs, which are related to piezophilic isolates, possess genes that may supplement energy demands through the oxidation of hydrogen or the reduction of nitrous oxide. We found evidence for potential trench-specific gene distributions, as several SAG genes were observed only in a PRT metagenome and not in shallower deep-sea metagenomes. These results illustrate new ecotype features that might perform important roles in the adaptation of microorganisms to life in hadal environments. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.",,"Amino acids; Ecology; Ecosystems; Microbiology; Microorganisms; Nitrogen oxides; Sea level; Surface waters; Comparative analysis; Energy demands; Glycolytic enzyme; High pressure; Microbial communities; Nitrous oxide; Oxidation of hydrogen; Shallow waters; Genes; adaptation; deep sea; gene; genome; hadal zone; microbial community; Atlantic Ocean; Puerto Rico Trench; Archaea; archaeal DNA; fatty acid; lipid; RNA 16S; sea water; sulfur; acclimatization; archaeal genome; archaeon; biosynthesis; classification; DNA sequence; ecosystem; energy metabolism; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; metagenome; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; physiology; Puerto Rico; sea; Acclimatization; Archaea; Base Sequence; DNA, Archaeal; Ecosystem; Energy Metabolism; Fatty Acids; Genome, Archaeal; Lipids; Metagenome; Molecular Sequence Data; Oceans and Seas; Puerto Rico; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sulfur; Water Microbiology","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949652927

Our first contribution is to clarify the worst-case size of positive existential (PE), non-recursive Data log (NDL), and first-order (FO) rewritings for various classes of tree-like conjunctive queries, ranging from linear queries to bounded tree width queries. Perhaps our most surprising result is a super polynomial lower bound on the size of PE-rewritings that holds already for linear queries and ontologies of depth 2. More positively, we show that polynomial-size NDL-rewritings always exist for tree-shaped queries with a bounded number of leaves (and arbitrary ontologies), and for bounded tree width queries paired with bounded depth ontologies. For FO-rewritings, we equate the existence of polysize rewritings with well-known problems in Boolean circuit complexity. As our second contribution, we analyze the computational complexity of query answering and establish tractability results (either NL-or LOGCFL-completeness) for a range of query-ontology pairs. Combining our new results with those from the literature yields a complete picture of the succinctness and complexity landscapes for the considered classes of queries and ontologies. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Birds; Forestry; Boolean circuit; Complexity results; Conjunctive queries; Like queries; Polynomial size; Query answering; Query topology; Super-polynomials; Trees (mathematics)","English",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945914190

For instance, Distance Bounding Protocols take into account the round trip time of messages and the transmission velocity to infer an upper bound of the distance between two agents. We classify such security protocols as Cyber-Physical. Time plays a key role in design and analysis of many of these protocols. This paper investigates the foundational differences and the impacts on the analysis when using models with discrete time and models with dense time. We show that there are attacks that can be found by models using dense time, but not when using discrete time. We illustrate this with a novel attack that can be carried out on most distance bounding protocols. In this attack, one exploits the execution delay of instructions during one clock cycle to convince a verifier that he is in a location different from his actual position. We propose a Multiset Rewriting model with dense time suitable for specifying cyber-physical security protocols. We introduce Circle-Configurations and show that they can be used to symbolically solve the reachability problem for our model. Finally, we show that for the important class of balanced theories the reachability problem is PSPACE-complete. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.",,"Mobile security; Network security; Cyber physicals; Cyber-Physical securities; Design and analysis; Distance bounding protocols; Multiset rewriting; Reachability problem; Security protocols; Transmission velocities; Security of data","English",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926635812

Words are differentially represented in the brain according to their semantic category and these difficulties in ASC predict reduced activation to emotion-related words in limbic structures crucial for affective processing. Semantic theories view 'emotion actions' as critical for learning the semantic relationship between a word and the emotion it describes, such that emotion words typically activate the cortical motor systems involved in expressing emotion actions such as facial expressions. As ASC are also characterised by motor deficits and atypical brain structure and function in these regions, motor structures would also be expected to show reduced activation during emotion-semantic processing. Here we used event-related fMRI to compare passive processing of emotion words in comparison to abstract verbs and animal names in typically-developing controls and individuals with ASC. Relatively reduced brain activation in ASC for emotion words, but not matched control words, was found in motor areas and cingulate cortex specifically. The degree of activation evoked by emotion words in the motor system was also associated with the extent of autistic traits as revealed by the Autism Spectrum Quotient. We suggest that hypoactivation of motor and limbic regions for emotion word processing may underlie difficulties in processing emotional language in ASC.
